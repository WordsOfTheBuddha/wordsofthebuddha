Brief Discourse on Illumination

"These four, bhikkhus, are the illuminations. What four? The illumination of the moon, the illumination of the sun, the illumination of fire, and the illumination of wisdomâ€”these, bhikkhus, are the four illuminations. Among these four illuminations, bhikkhus, the illumination of wisdom is the foremost."
