"Bhikkhus, there are four Dhamma principles that are foremost, ancient, rooted in tradition, timeless, and pure, having never been mingled. These principles are unconfounded and will remain so; they are respected and upheld by ascetics, brahmins, and the wise. What are these four?

The principle of contentment (free of covetousness/free from wanting with yearning and eagerness/free of attachment), bhikkhus, is a foremost, ancient, traditional, timeless, and pure Dhamma principle. It has never been mingled, is not confounded, and will not be confounded. It is respected and upheld by ascetics, brahmins, and the wise.

The principle of good-will (free of ill-will/aversion/hatred/resentment/enmity), bhikkhus, likewise stands as a foremost, ancient, traditional, timeless, and pure Dhamma principle. It remains pure and unmingled, unconfounded now and into the future, and is revered by ascetics, brahmins, and the wise.

The principle of right mindfulness (mindfulness of body/feelings/mind/mental qualities), bhikkhus, also ranks as a foremost, ancient, traditional, timeless, and pure Dhamma principle. It has never been altered or mixed, will not be confounded, and is esteemed by ascetics, brahmins, and the wise.

Finally, the principle of right concentration (jhƒÅnas), bhikkhus, is a foremost, ancient, traditional, timeless, and pure Dhamma principle. It has always remained pure, is unconfounded, and will continue to be so, respected by ascetics, brahmins, and the wise.

These, bhikkhus, are the four Dhamma principles that are foremost, ancient, traditional, timeless, and pure. They are unconfounded and will remain unconfounded, respected and upheld by ascetics, brahmins, and the wise."

"One should dwell as one who is free from covetousness,  
with a mind that is unafflicted.  
Being mindful,  
with focused and internally well-composed mind."
