The Spiritual Life

"Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is not led to deceive people, not for gaining their applause, not for acquiring gains and honors, nor for winning an argument, nor out of a desire for people to know 'thus about me'. Rather, bhikkhus, this spiritual life is led for the purpose of restraint, for abandoning, for dispassion, and for cessation.

For restraint, for abandoning,
this unerring spiritual life;
Thus taught the Blessed One,
leading to a firm footing in Nibbāna;
This path is followed by the Noble ones,
walked by the esteemed sages.

Those who practice it as taught by the Buddha,
will make an end of suffering,
abiding by the Teacher’s instruction."
