The Spiritual Life

"This spiritual life, bhikkhus, is not lived for the sake of deceiving people, not for the sake of cajoling people, not for the sake of gaining material rewards and honors, not for the sake of winning debates, nor is it lived for the sake of being known by people as 'Thus I am known.' Rather, this spiritual life, bhikkhus, is lived for the purpose of restraint, for the purpose of abandonment, for the purpose of dispassion, for the purpose of cessation.

For the purpose of restraint, for the purpose of abandonment,
the spiritual life is lived without deceit;
Thus taught the Blessed One,
leading to the summit of nibbana;
This is the path followed by the noble ones,
pursued by the esteemed sages.

Those who practice it,
as taught by the Buddha;
They will make an end of suffering,
fulfilling the Teacher's instruction."
