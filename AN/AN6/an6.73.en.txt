Discourse on the First Jhāna

Bhikkhus, there are six qualities which, if not abandoned, make it impossible to attain and dwell in the first jhāna. Which six? Sensual desire, ill-will, complacency (dullness and drowsiness), restlessness (mental agitation), doubt, and a failure to clearly see the true danger in sensual pleasures with correct wisdom. These six qualities, if not relinquished, indeed make it impossible to attain and abide in the first jhāna.

Bhikkhus, by abandoning these six qualities one becomes capable of attaining and dwelling in the first jhāna. Which six? Sensual desire, ill-will, complacency, restlessness, doubt, and the true perception of the danger in sensual pleasures. By truly understanding and overcoming these hindrances with right wisdom, one becomes capable of entering and remaining in the first jhāna.
