For one with wrong view, wrong intention arises; for one with wrong intention, wrong speech arises; for one with wrong speech, wrong action arises; for one with wrong action, wrong livelihood arises; for one with wrong livelihood, wrong effort arises; for one with wrong effort, wrong mindfulness arises; for one with wrong mindfulness, wrong collectedness (concentration) arises; for one with wrong collectedness, wrong wisdom arises; for one with wrong wisdom, false liberation arises. Thus, bhikkhus, approaching wrongness leads to failure, not success.
