The First Discourse on the Bases of Spiritual Power

"Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who develops and frequently practices these five qualities can expect one of two results: either final knowledge (enlightenment) in this very life or, if there is a trace of clinging left, the state of non-returning.

What are these five?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the base of spiritual power that is endowed with collectedness arising from interest (a goal/an objective/an aspiration) and accompanied by determined and habitual dispositions,

develops the base of spiritual power that is endowed with collectedness due to persistence (energy) and active effort and accompanied by determined and habitual dispositions,

develops the base of spiritual power that is endowed with collectedness due to mind (consciousness) and active effort and accompanied by determined and habitual dispositions,

develops the base of spiritual power that is endowed with collectedness due to investigation (reflection and close examination) and accompanied by determined and habitual dispositions,

and this makes the fifth.

Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who develops and frequently practices these five qualities can expect one of two results: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a trace of clinging left, the state of non-returning."
