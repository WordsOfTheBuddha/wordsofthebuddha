Discourse on Direct Knowledge

"Bhikkhus, these are the four mental qualities. What four? There are, bhikkhus, mental qualities that should be fully comprehended by direct knowledge; there are, bhikkhus, mental qualities that should be abandoned by direct knowledge; there are, bhikkhus, mental qualities that should be developed by direct knowledge; there are, bhikkhus, mental qualities that should be personally realized by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the mental qualities that should be fully comprehended by direct knowledge? The five aggregates subject to clinging — these are called, bhikkhus, the mental qualities that should be fully comprehended by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the mental qualities that should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance (not understanding how things have come to be) and craving for becoming (existence) — these are called, bhikkhus, the mental qualities that should be abandoned by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the mental qualities that should be developed by direct knowledge? Tranquility and insight — these are called, bhikkhus, the mental qualities that should be developed by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the mental qualities that should be personally realized by direct knowledge? Wisdom and liberation — these are called, bhikkhus, the mental qualities that should be realized by direct knowledge.

These, indeed, bhikkhus, are the four mental qualities."
