A Brief Discourse

Once, the Blessed One was staying at Vesālī in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One; having approached, she paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One:

"Please, venerable sir, teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute."

"Gotamī, you should know the Dhamma to be abandoned if you find: 'These teachings lead to passion, not to dispassion; to being bound, not to being unbound; to accumulating, not to shedding; to wanting more, not to wanting less; to discontentment, not to contentment; to company, not to solitude; to laziness, not to the arousal of energy; to being burdensome, not to being unburdensome.' In this way, Gotamī, you should conclude: 'This is not the Dhamma, this is not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher's instruction.'

And, Gotamī, you should know the Dhamma to be embraced if you find: 'These teachings lead to dispassion, not to passion; to being unbound, not to being bound; to shedding, not to accumulating; to wanting less, not to wanting more; to contentment, not to discontentment; to solitude, not to company; to the arousal of energy, not to laziness; to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome.' In this way, Gotamī, you should conclude: 'This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher's instruction.'"
