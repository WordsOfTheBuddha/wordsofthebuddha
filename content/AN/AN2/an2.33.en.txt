Discourse on Repaying Parents

"Bhikkhus, I say there are two people who are not easy to repay. Which two? The mother and the father.

Even if one should carry one’s mother on one shoulder and one’s father on the other shoulder for a hundred years, and attend to them by anointing, massaging, bathing, and rubbing their limbs, even if they were to defecate and urinate right there, still, bhikkhus, one has not done enough for one’s parents, nor repaid them.

Moreover, bhikkhus, if one should establish one’s parents as supreme rulers of this great earth, abounding in wealth and treasures, still, bhikkhus, one has not done enough for one’s parents, nor repaid them. And why is that? Because, bhikkhus, parents are of great help to their children; they bring them up, nourish them, and show them the world.

But, bhikkhus, if one encourages, settles, and establishes one’s unbelieving parents in experiential confidence (faith), one’s immoral parents in ethical conduct, one’s stingy parents in generosity, and one’s foolish parents in wisdom — in this way, bhikkhus, one has done enough for one’s parents and has repaid them."
