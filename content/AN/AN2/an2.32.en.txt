Discourse on persons with and without integrity

"I will teach you, bhikkhus, the domain of a person without integrity and the domain of a person with integrity. Listen to this, pay careful attention, I will speak."

"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

"What, bhikkhus, is the domain of a person without integrity? The person without integrity, bhikkhus, is ungrateful and does not acknowledge the help given to them. It is recognized, bhikkhus, as the mark of a person without integrity to be ungrateful and not acknowledge what has been done for them. This, bhikkhus, is the entirety of the domain of a person without integrity: ingratitude and not acknowledging what has been done for them. And what, bhikkhus, is the domain of a person with integrity? The person with integrity, bhikkhus, is grateful and acknowledges the help given to them. It is recognized, bhikkhus, as the mark of a person with integrity to be grateful and to acknowledge what has been done for them. This, bhikkhus, is the entirety of the domain of a person with integrity: gratitude and acknowledging what has been done for them."
