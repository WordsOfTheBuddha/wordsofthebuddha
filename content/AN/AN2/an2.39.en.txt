Discourse on The Strength of Bhikkhus

"Bhikkhus, when robbers are strong, kings at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the king is not able to travel or send out forces to the border regions, or to effectively govern the outlying provinces. Likewise, at that time, it is not easy for brahmins and householders to travel, send out forces, or inspect their fields and workers. Similarly, bhikkhus, when bhikkhus who practice wrongly are strong, bhikkhus who practice rightly at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus who practice rightly remain silent and subdued within the Sangha, or they dwell in the outlying regions. This situation is for the harm and misfortune of many, for the suffering and detriment of many persons, gods, and humans.

Then, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus who practice wrongly remain silent and subdued within the Sangha, or they leave. This situation is for the benefit and happiness of many, for the welfare and prosperity of many persons, gods, and humans."
