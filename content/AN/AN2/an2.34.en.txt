Discourse on Action and Non-action

Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One, and having approached, exchanged greetings with him. When the courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One, "What does Venerable Gotama teach? What does he declare?"

"I teach action and I teach non-action, brahmin."

"How, Venerable Gotama, do you teach action and non-action?"

"I teach, brahmin, the non-action of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct, and of all sorts of evil and unwholesome qualities. And I teach the action of bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, mental good conduct, and of all sorts of wholesome qualities. Thus, brahmin, I teach action and non-action."

"Excellent, Venerable Gotama! ... Please consider me as a lay follower who has gone to you for refuge from this day forth for life."
