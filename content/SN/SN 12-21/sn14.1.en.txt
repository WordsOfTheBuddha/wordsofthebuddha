Discourse on Diversity of Elements

At Sāvatthi.

"I will teach you the diversity of elements, bhikkhus. Listen closely and pay close attention, I will speak."

"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus responded to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

"And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? The eye-element, the form-element, the eye-consciousness-element; the ear-element, the sound-element, the ear-consciousness-element; the nose-element, the odor-element, the nose-consciousness-element; the tongue-element, the taste-element, the tongue-consciousness-element; the body-element, the tactile-element, the body-consciousness-element; the mind-element, the mental-qualities-element, the mind-consciousness-element — this is called, bhikkhus, the diversity of elements."
