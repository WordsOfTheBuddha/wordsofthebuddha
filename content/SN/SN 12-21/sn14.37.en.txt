The Discourse on Ascetics and Brahmins

At SƒÅvatthi.

"There are, bhikkhus, these four elements. What four? The earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element. Those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand as they really are the attraction, the danger, and the escape in these four elements... Such, bhikkhus, among ascetics or brahmins are neither considered ascetics among ascetics nor brahmins among brahmins; nor do they, having realized it for themselves with direct knowledge, abide in peace in this very life.

But, bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who understand as they really are the attraction, the danger, and the escape in these four elements... Such, bhikkhus, among ascetics or brahmins are considered ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins; and they, having realized it for themselves with direct knowledge, abide in peace in this very life."
