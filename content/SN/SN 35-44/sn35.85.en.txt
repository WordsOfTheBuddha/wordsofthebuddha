Discourse on The World is Empty

Then, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:

"'The world is empty, the world is empty', it is said, venerable sir. In what sense, venerable sir, is it said, 'the world is empty'?"

"Because, Ānanda, it is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, therefore it is said, 'the world is empty'. And what, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self? The eye, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Forms are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, eye-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, eye-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Ear, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Sounds are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, ear-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, ear-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Similarly, the nose and odors, the tongue and flavors, the body and tactile sensations, the mind and mental objects — all are empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Mind-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, mind-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Because, Ānanda, it is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, therefore, it is said, 'the world is empty'."
