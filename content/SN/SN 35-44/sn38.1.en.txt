A Question on Nibbāna

Once, the venerable Sāriputta was dwelling in the Magadhan lands, in the village of Nālaka. Then, the wanderer Jambukhādaka approached the venerable Sāriputta. After approaching, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta. After their cordial and meaningful conversation, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the wanderer Jambukhādaka said to the venerable Sāriputta:

“'Nibbāna, Nibbāna,' it is said, friend Sāriputta. What, friend, is Nibbāna?”

“What is called Nibbāna, friend, is the ending of passion (lust, greed, attachment), the ending of aversion (hatred, ill-will, resentment), the ending of delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification) — this is called Nibbāna.”

“Is there, friend, a path, is there a way for the realization of this Nibbāna?”

“There is, friend, a path, there is a way for the realization of this Nibbāna.”

“What, friend, is the path, what is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna?”

“This very Noble Eightfold Path, friend, is the path, this is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna, namely — right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness. This, friend, is the path, this is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna.”

“Good, friend, is the path, excellent is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna. And sufficient, friend Sāriputta, is this for diligence.”
