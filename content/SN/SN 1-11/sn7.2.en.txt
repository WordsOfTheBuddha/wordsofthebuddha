The Discourse on Insults

At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagaha, in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrel's Sanctuary.

The brahmin Akkosaka Bhāradvāja heard: "It is said that a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan has gone forth from the household life to the homeless life in the presence of the ascetic Gotama." Angry and displeased, he approached the Blessed One; having approached, he abused and insulted the Blessed One with improper and harsh words. When this was said, the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Akkosaka Bhāradvāja:

"What do you think, brahmin, do friends, colleagues, relatives, and guests come to you?"

"On some occasions, sir Gotama, friends, colleagues, relatives, and guests come to me."

"What do you think, brahmin, do you offer them food, meals, or bedding?"

"On some occasions, sir Gotama, I offer them food, meals, or bedding."

"But if they do not accept it, Brahmin, to whom does it belong?"

"If they do not accept it, sir Gotama, it belongs to us only."

"Even so, Brahmin, what you have insulted us with, who do not insult, who are not angry, who do not quarrel, we do not accept it. It belongs to you, Brahmin, it is yours alone.

Whoever insults back an insulting person, gets angry at an angry person, quarrels with a quarreling person, is said, Brahmin, to partake and carry on the quarrel. But we neither partake nor carry it on with you. It belongs to you, Brahmin, it is yours alone."

"Indeed, the assembly including the king knows Gotama as the worthy ascetic. Yet however, the Blessed One Gotama is angry."

"How can there be anger in one without anger,
in one who is disciplined and lives in harmony?
In one with true knowledge, liberated,
calm, and steadfast.

It is worse for the one,
who retaliates against the angry one;
Not retaliating against the angry,
one wins a battle hard to win.

He acts for the benefit of both,
of himself and the other;
Knowing the other is agitated,
the mindful one calms down.

Those who heal both,
themselves and the other;
are thought foolish by people,
who are unskilled in the teachings."

When this was said, the brahmin Akkosaka Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, sir Gotama... I go for refuge to the Blessed One Gotama, to the teachings of the Blessed One (Dhamma), and to the community of bhikkhus. May I receive the ordination in the presence of the Blessed One Gotama, may I receive the full ordination."

The brahmin Akkosaka Bhāradvāja received the ordination in the presence of the Blessed One, he received the full ordination. Having recently received full ordination, the venerable Akkosaka Bhāradvāja, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute, soon realized with direct knowledge in this very life, for the purpose of which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life to the homeless life, the unsurpassed culmination of the holy life, having personally attained it, he dwelled.

He understood: "Ended is birth, lived is the holy life, done is the task, there is no more of this state of existence." And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one among the arahants.
