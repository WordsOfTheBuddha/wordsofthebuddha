The Discourse on Moths Rushing to the Flame

Thus have I heard — Once, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, within the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. At that time, under the dark night sky, illuminated only by oil lamps, the Blessed One sat in the open.

During this period, numerous moths, drawn to the light of those oil lamps, met with tragedy, experiencing misfortune and disaster. The Blessed One observed these many moths as they plummeted into the lamps, facing their unfortunate and disastrous end.

Upon recognizing this, the Blessed One, in that moment, gave voice to this inspired utterance:

"Rushing forward, they find no essence,
Always forming, bond upon new bond;
They plunge like moths into the flame,
Bound by what is seen, heard (and assumed)."
