Welcome to the Words of the Buddha!

### Design Goal

Support learning of the teachings of the Buddha with a consistent translation.

The right balance of:

* Faithful reproduction from the source texts with a line-by-line fidelity between Pali and English texts
* Providing context for alternate close synonyms that promote understanding for technical terms
* Keeping certain words in original form that don't have an equivalent today: e.g. bhikkhu v/s monk
