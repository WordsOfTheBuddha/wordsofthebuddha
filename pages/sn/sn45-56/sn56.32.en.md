Acacia Leaf Discourse

"Bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'Without truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, without truly understanding the noble truth of the origin of suffering, without truly understanding the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and without truly understanding the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is not possible.

Just as, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'I will make a container out of acacia leaves, or pine leaves, or tamarind leaves, and with it, I will fetch water or carry palm fruit' — it is not possible; similarly, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'Without truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is not possible.

However, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'By truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, by truly understanding the noble truth of the origin of suffering, by truly understanding the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and by truly understanding the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is indeed possible.

Just as, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'I will make a container out of lotus leaves, or Butea leaves, or Hibiscus leaves, and with it, I will fetch water or carry palm fruit' — it is indeed possible; similarly, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'By truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is indeed possible.

Therefore, here, bhikkhus, effort should be made to understand: 'This is suffering. This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering'."
