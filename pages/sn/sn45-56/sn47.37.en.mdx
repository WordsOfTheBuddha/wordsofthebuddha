Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, with full awareness, and mindful, having removed craving and aversion (dissatisfaction) regarding the world; Similarly, he dwells observing feelings and of itself, mind in and of itself, and mental qualities in and of itself, with continuous effort, with full awareness, and mindful, having removed craving and aversion (dissatisfaction) regarding the world. It is in this manner, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is mindful.
