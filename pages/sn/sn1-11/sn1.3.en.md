Discourse on The Short Life

At SƒÅvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity spoke this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"Life ebbs away, its span is short,
For one brought to old age, there are no shelters;
Clearly seeing this danger in death,
one should do meritorious deeds that bring happiness.

"Life ebbs away, its span is short,
For one brought to old age, there are no shelters;
Clearly seeing this danger in death,
one should abandon worldly pleasures, looking for peace."
