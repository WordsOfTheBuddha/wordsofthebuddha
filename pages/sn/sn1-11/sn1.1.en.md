Discourse on Crossing the Flood

Thus have I heard — At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.

Then, in the stillness of the night, a certain deity, of surpassing beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, she stood at one side. Standing to one side, that deity said to the Blessed One: "How, dear sir, did you cross over the flood?"

"Without any support, friend, and without struggling, I crossed over the flood."

"But how, dear sir, did you cross over the flood without any support and without struggling?"

"When I took support, friend, I sank; when I struggled, I was swept away. In this way, friend, without any support, without struggling, I crossed over the flood."

After a long time, indeed, I see,
a Brahmin who has attained final Nibbāna;
Without any support, without struggling,
having crossed over the entanglements of the world.

Thus spoke that deity. The Teacher approved. Then that deity, having said "The Teacher approved," paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and vanished right there.
