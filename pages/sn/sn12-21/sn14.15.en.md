## Walking Back and Forth

At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain. At that time, the Venerable Sāriputta was walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Mahākassapa was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Anuruddha was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāniputta was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Upāli was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Ānanda was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; and Devadatta was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you see Sāriputta walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are of great wisdom. Do you see Moggallāna walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus have great spiritual powers. Do you see Kassapa walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are ascetics of austere practices. Do you see Anuruddha walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus have the divine eye. Do you see Puṇṇa Mantāniputta walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are teachers of the Dhamma. Do you see Upāli walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are masters of the discipline. Do you see Ānanda walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are very learned. Do you see Devadatta walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus have evil desires."

"Bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to their disposition. Those with inferior dispositions associate with those of inferior dispositions; those intent on good associate with those intent on good."

"In the past, too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated according to their disposition. Those with inferior dispositions associated with those of inferior dispositions; those intent on good associated with those intent on good. In the future, too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate according to their disposition. Those with inferior dispositions will associate with those of inferior dispositions; those intent on good will associate with those intent on good. Even now, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to their disposition. Those with inferior dispositions associate with those of inferior dispositions; those intent on good associate with those intent on good."
