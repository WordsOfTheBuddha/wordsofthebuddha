Discourse on Consciousness

At SƒÅvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, when one delights in and craves things that are the basis for fetters, there is a descent of consciousness.

With consciousness as condition, name-and-form comes to be; with name-and-form as condition, contact comes to be; with contact as condition, feeling comes to be; with feeling as condition, craving comes to be; with craving as condition, clinging comes to be; from clinging as condition, there is becoming; from becoming, there is birth; from birth, there arises aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.

Suppose, bhikkhus, there is a great tree. As long as its roots remain, even if the trunk is cut down, it will continue to grow.

Similarly, when one delights in and craves things that are the basis for fetters, there is a descent of consciousness, which leads to the continuation of the cycle of suffering.

However, bhikkhus, when one does not delight in and does not crave things that are the basis for fetters, there is no descent of consciousness.

When there is no descent of consciousness, there is no name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases; with the cessation of becoming, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.

Suppose, bhikkhus, there is a great tree. If a man were to come with a spade and basket and dig up its roots, causing the roots to be cut and withered, that tree would not grow anymore. Similarly, when one does not delight in and crave things that are the basis for fetters, there is no descent of consciousness, which leads to the cessation of the cycle of suffering."
