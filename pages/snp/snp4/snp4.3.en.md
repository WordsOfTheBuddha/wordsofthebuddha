Eight Verses on Corruption

Some indeed speak with a corrupted mind,
while others indeed speak with a mind of truth;
However, the sage does not engage in disputes that arise,
which is why they've no discontentedness at all.

How indeed could one abandon one's own views,
when driven by desire and entrenched in preferences;
One forms one's own assessments,
and speaks as one perceives them to be.

Whoever praises their own virtues,
without being asked by others;
They have an ignoble nature, the wise say,
whoever praises themselves of their own accord.

A bhikkhu, peaceful and with completely cooled mind,
does not boast about his virtues;
They have a noble nature, the wise say,
he who has no pride whatsoever in the world.

For those who have crafted and established their own doctrines,
and advanced them despite their flaws;
If they see a personal benefit,
they cling to this, relying on a fragile peace.

Overcoming attachment to ingrained beliefs is not easy,
once one has committed to chosen doctrines after careful consideration;
Thus, a person, caught up in these attachments,
rejects one set of teachings and embraces another.

The purified one indeed has nothing in the world,
no formulated opinions on existence or non-existence;
having abandoned illusion and pride,
by what path would such a one travel? They are uninvolved.

Engagement in doctrines indeed leads to disputes,
but how could one without engagement even discuss them?
For one devoid of self, there is no self-interest,
they have settled all views right here in this very life.
