Discourse on the Cave

A being, enveloped by many things within the cave of ignorance,
stands deeply mired in delusion;
Such a one is far from seclusion,
For sensual pleasures in the world are not easy to relinquish.

Arising from desire and bound to the pleasure of existence,
they are difficult to liberate, for one cannot liberate another;
Whether reflecting on the past or anticipating the future,
they long for these desires, recurring echoes of the past.

Greedy, entangled, and confused in sensual pleasures,
they are cast into dire and perilous circumstances;
Brought to suffering, they lament,
'What indeed shall we become after departing from here?'"

Therefore one should train earnestly here and now,
by discerning the causes of turmoil in the world;
One should avoid actions that provoke further discord,
for the wise proclaim, "Life is fleeting."

I see in the world, beings struggling,
engulfed in craving within their existences;
Base individuals chatter at death's door,
still caught in the unquenched craving of repeated existence.

Observe them struggling in identities claimed as 'mine',
just like fish in a dwindling stream of shallow water;
Having seen this too, one should actively practice to be free from 'mine',
not forming attachments to any existence.

Balancing extremes, one should temper their desires,
fully aware of sensory contacts without succumbing to cravings;
Abstaining from actions that are condemnable,
the wise remain unattached to what is seen and heard.

Fully comprehending perception, one should cross beyond the flood,
amidst all possessions, the sage is detached;
Having extracted the dart of affliction, he proceeds with vigilant awareness,
devoid of desire for this world or beyond.
