<Verse>
For the one desiring pleasure,
If he succeeds in attaining his desires,
Certainly he becomes delighted,
Having obtained what he wants.

However, for the person bound by desire,
Aroused by desire,
If those pleasures fade,
He breaks down in despair, like one struck by an arrow.

Whoever keeps away from desiring,
As one avoids stepping on a snake's head with their foot;
Finds tranquility in this entangling world,
Mindful, they overcome its tangles.

Fields, properties, and gold,
Cattle and assistants,
Women and relatives,
When a man yearns deeply for these -

Weaknesses overpower him,
And insecurities agonize him,
From this suffering follows him,
As water fills into a broken boat.

Therefore, let one always be mindful,
And steer clear of sense desires,
By abandoning them, one crosses the flood,
As a bailed-out boat reaches the far shore.
