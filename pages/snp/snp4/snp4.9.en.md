Discourse With Māgandiya

"Having seen craving, aversion, and passion,
there was no desire even for sexual intercourse
What is body, filled with urine and feces?
I would not wish to touch it even with my foot."

Māgandiya:
"If you do not desire such a jewel,
a woman sought after by many kings,
what kind of viewpoint, precepts and practices, livelihood,
and existence after death do you speak of?"

Blessed One:
"As nothing is grasped among various teachings,
so for me there is no 'This I proclaim,'
having seen but not grasped among many views,
through discernment among them, I formerly saw inner peace."

Māgandiya:
"O sage, you speak of judgments you have formed,
without having adopted any of those views.
As to that matter of 'inner peace' —
how is that described by the wise?"
