#### Verse 1
Mind precedes all mental states.
Mind is their chief, they are all mind-made;
If with a corrupted mind,
one speaks or acts;
discontentment follows them,
like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.

#### Verse 2
Mind precedes all mental states,
mind is their chief; they are all mind-made;
If with a clear mind,
one speaks or acts;
happiness follows them,
like a never-departing shadow.

#### Verse 3 - 4
He insulted me, he hurt me,
he defeated me, he robbed me.
Those who hold onto resentment
do not still their hatred.

He insulted me, he hurt me,
he defeated me, he robbed me.
Those who let go of resentment
still their hatred.

#### Verse 5
Hatred is never reconciled by hatred,
in this world at any time;
Only by non-hatred is hatred reconciled,
This is an eternal principle.

#### Verse 6
Others do not realize
that we all must die;
But those who do realize this
their conflicts cease.

#### Verse 7 - 8
Living perceiving the attractive,
unrestrained in the senses;
Not knowing moderation in eating,
with laziness and little effort;
Māra indeed overcomes that one,
like the wind overcomes a weak tree.

Living perceiving the unattractive,
well-restrained in the senses;
Knowing moderation in eating,
with faith and strong effort;
Māra indeed does not overcome that one,
like the wind does not overcome a mountain rock.

#### Verse 9 - 10
If one is impure,
and wears the bhikkhu's ochre robe;
Lacking self-restraint and truth,
they are not worthy of the robe.

But one who has discarded impurity,
well composed in virtues;
Endowed with self-restraint and truth,
is indeed worthy of the robe.

#### Verse 11 - 12
Those who think the unessential is essential,
and see the essential as unessential;
They do not attain the essence,
being in the domain of wrong intention.

And those who know the essential as essential,
and the unessential as unessential;
They attain the essence,
being in the domain of right intention.

#### Verse 13 - 14
Just as a poorly covered house,
is penetrated by rain;
so is an untrained mind,
penetrated by passion.

Just as a well-covered house,
is not penetrated by rain;
so is a well-trained mind,
not penetrated by passion.

#### Verse 15
Here he grieves, after death he grieves,
the evil-doer grieves in both places;
He grieves, he is tormented,
having seen the impurity of his own actions.

#### Verse 16
Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices,
the doer of good deeds rejoices in both places;
He rejoices, he delights,
having seen the purity of his own actions.

#### Verse 17
Here he is consumed, after death he is consumed,
the evildoer is consumed in both places;
consumed by the thought "Evil has been done by me",
and consumed even more after reaching a woeful state.

#### Verse 18
Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices,
the doer of good rejoices in both places;
rejoicing in the thought, "Merit has been done by me,"
and he rejoices even more after reaching a blissful state.

#### Verse 19 - 20
Even if a person speaks many eloquent words,
if they do not act accordingly, being heedless;
Like a cowherd counting others' cows,
they do not partake in the true ascetic life.

Even if a person speaks few eloquent words,
If they act according to the Dhamma,
Abandoning passion, aversion, and delusion,
Clearly comprehending with a well-liberated mind,
Not clinging here or hereafter,
They partake in the true ascetic life.
