1.
<Verse>
Mind precedes all mental states.
Mind is their chief, they are all mind-made;
If with a corrupted mind,
one speaks or acts;
discontentment follows them,
like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.
</Verse>

2.
<Verse>
Mind precedes all mental states,
mind is their chief; they are all mind-made;
If with a clear mind,
one speaks or acts;
happiness follows them,
like a never-departing shadow.
</Verse>

3.
<Verse>
He insulted me, he hurt me,
he defeated me, he robbed me.
Those who hold onto resentment
do not still their hatred.
</Verse>

4.
<Verse>
He insulted me, he hurt me,
he defeated me, he robbed me.
Those who let go of resentment
still their hatred.
</Verse>

5.
<Verse>
Hatred is never reconciled by hatred,
in this world at any time;
Only by non-hatred is hatred reconciled,
This is an eternal principle.
</Verse>

6.
<Verse>
Others do not realize
that we all must die;
But those who do realize this
their conflicts cease.
</Verse>

7.
<Verse>
Living perceiving the attractive,
unrestrained in the senses;
Not knowing moderation in eating,
with laziness and little effort;
Māra indeed overcomes that one,
like the wind overcomes a weak tree.
</Verse>

8.
<Verse>
Living perceiving the unattractive,
well-restrained in the senses;
Knowing moderation in eating,
with faith and strong effort;
Māra indeed does not overcome that one,
like the wind does not overcome a mountain rock.
</Verse>

9.
<Verse>
If one is impure,
and wears the bhikkhu's ochre robe;
Lacking self-restraint and truth,
they are not worthy of the robe.
</Verse>

10.
<Verse>
But one who has discarded impurity,
well composed in virtues;
Endowed with self-restraint and truth,
is indeed worthy of the robe.
</Verse>

11.
<Verse>
Those who think the unessential is essential,
and see the essential as unessential;
They do not attain the essence,
being in the domain of wrong intention.
</Verse>

12.
<Verse>
And those who know the essential as essential,
and the unessential as unessential;
They attain the essence,
being in the domain of right intention.
</Verse>

13.
<Verse>
Just as a poorly covered house,
is penetrated by rain;
so is an untrained mind,
penetrated by passion.
</Verse>

14.
<Verse>
Just as a well-covered house,
is not penetrated by rain;
so is a well-trained mind,
not penetrated by passion.
</Verse>

15.
<Verse>
Here he grieves, after death he grieves,
the evil-doer grieves in both places;
He grieves, he is tormented,
having seen the impurity of his own actions.
</Verse>

16.
<Verse>
Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices,
the doer of good deeds rejoices in both places;
He rejoices, he delights,
having seen the purity of his own actions.
</Verse>

17.
<Verse>
Here he is consumed, after death he is consumed,
the evildoer is consumed in both places;
consumed by the thought "Evil has been done by me",
and consumed even more after reaching a woeful state.
</Verse>

18.
<Verse>
Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices,
the doer of good rejoices in both places;
rejoicing in the thought, "Merit has been done by me,"
and he rejoices even more after reaching a blissful state.
</Verse>

19.
<Verse>
Even if a person speaks many eloquent words,
if they do not act accordingly, being heedless;
Like a cowherd counting others' cows,
they do not partake in the true ascetic life.
</Verse>

20.
<Verse>
Even if a person speaks few eloquent words,
If they act according to the Dhamma,
Abandoning passion, aversion, and delusion,
Clearly comprehending with a well-liberated mind,
Not clinging here or hereafter,
They partake in the true ascetic life.
</Verse>
