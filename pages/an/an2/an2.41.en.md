Discourse on Understanding and Misunderstanding the Dhamma

"Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who misunderstand the discourses and misinterpret the expressions, and thereby reject the meaning and the Dhamma, these bhikkhus are practicing for the harm of many, for the misfortune, suffering, and harm of many persons, gods, and humans. These bhikkhus generate much demerit, and they cause the true Dhamma to disappear.

Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who well understand the discourses and correctly interpret the expressions, and thereby align with the meaning and the Dhamma, these bhikkhus are practicing for the benefit of many, for the happiness, welfare, and benefit of many persons, gods, and humans. These bhikkhus generate much meritorious action, and they preserve the true Dhamma."
