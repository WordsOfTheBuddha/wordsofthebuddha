Discourse on worthy of offerings

Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, and having approached, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, how many persons are worthy of offerings in the world? Where should gifts be given?"

"Householder, there are two persons in the world who are worthy of offerings — the trainee and the arahant. These are the two persons worthy of offerings in the world, and gifts should be given to them."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One further said:

"The trainee and the arahant in this world,
Are worthy of offerings from those who make offerings;
They are upright in body,
in speech, and in mind;
That field for those who make offerings
Gives great fruit."
