Discourse on Suffering

"Bhikkhus, endowed with six qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering, with distress, anguish, and burning in this very life, and upon the breaking up of the body after death, a bad destination is to be expected. What six? With thoughts of sensuality, ill-will, and harming, and with perceptions of sensuality, ill will, and harming — bhikkhus, endowed with these six qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering, with distress, anguish, and burning in this very life, and upon the breaking up of the body after death, a bad destination is to be expected."

"Bhikkhus, endowed with six qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in ease, without distress, without anguish, without burning in this very life, and upon the breaking up of the body after death, a good destination is to be expected. What six? With thoughts of relinquishment, non-ill will, and non-harming, and with perceptions of relinquishment, non-ill will, and non-harming — bhikkhus, endowed with these six qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in ease, without distress, without anguish, without burning in this very life, and upon the breaking up of the body after death, a good destination is to be expected."
