Discourse on Self-Harm

From self-harm, fear arises,
Observe the people involved in conflicts;
I will recount the urgency of awakening,
as it has profoundly stirred within me.

Seeing beings floundering,
like fish in shallow water;
Seeing them obstructed by one another,
fear overcame me.

The world is completely essence-less,
all directions are unsettled;
Desiring a sanctuary for myself,
I saw no place secure.

Indeed, at the ultimate impasse,
understanding the obstruction, discontent arose in me;
Here then, I discerned the dart,
hard to perceive and lodged deep within the heart.

Afflicted by that dart,
my mind raced in all directions;
Upon extracting that very dart,
I neither fled nor faltered.

In that regard, trainings are praised,
Those which are highly esteemed in the world,
One should not be engrossed in them;
Having fully penetrated all sense-desires,
One should train for one's own liberation (Nibbāna).

One should be truthful, humble,
straightforward, and free from deceit or slander;
Without anger, free from the sin of greed
the sage spreads these virtues without partiality.

One should dwell free of sleepiness, fatigue, and dullness,
do not dwell with negligence;
One should continue without self-importance,
with a mind inclined to Nibbāna.

Do not be misled by falsehood,
nor cultivate attachment to mere appearances;
Fully understand conceit,
and conduct oneself without impulsiveness.

Do not delight in the old,
nor seek comfort in the new;
Do not grieve for what is declining,
and do not become bound by craving.

Greed, I say, is the great flood,
longing, a swift and sweeping current;
The forming of intentions, the compulsion,
the mire of sense-desires is difficult to escape.

The sage, not deviating truth,
stands firmly on the ground;
having relinquished all,
he is indeed called 'peaceful'.

Indeed, he who is wise and has perfect knowledge,
having understood the Dhamma, they are independent;
rightly he conducts himself in the world,
desiring nothing from anyone.

One who has crossed beyond sense-desires,
the bond in the world so hard to surmount;
he neither grieves nor resents,
having crossed the stream, he is unbound.

What was before, let it wither away,
let there be nothing after;
if you grasp not at the middle,
you will live in peace.

In all of name-and-form,
for whom there is no 'mine-making';
Does not grieve for that which is not,
such a one suffers no loss in the world.

For whom there is no 'this is mine',
nor anything belonging to others;
Finding no 'mine-ness',
he does not grieve, saying 'nothing is mine'.

Without hurry, without greed,
without impulses, equal towards all;
I declare these benefits,
Asked about the steady.

For the one knowing the unperturbed,
there is no fabrication at all;
Not engaging in new ventures,
he sees safety everywhere.

Neither in equal nor in unequal,
Nor in the excellent does the sage speak;
Peaceful, free from stinginess,
He neither asserts nor disparages.
