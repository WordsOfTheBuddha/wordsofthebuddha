			This page explains what information Words of the Buddha ("we",
			"our", "the site") collects, how it’s used, and the choices you
			have. This policy applies to the website and any associated services
			exposed under this domain.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> {effectiveDate}</p>

		<h3>What we collect</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Basic usage data for analytics and performance. We use
				privacy-friendly website analytics and performance tooling
				provided by our hosting platform to understand aggregate usage
				(e.g., pages visited, general device/browser info). This is used
				to improve the site and does not include the contents of your
				reading or highlighting.
			</li>
			<li>
				Preferences you set in your browser are stored locally on your
				device using localStorage (e.g., theme, Pāli mode, layout, font
				size, and Pāli lookup preference). These do not leave your
				device unless you explicitly share your URL or screenshots.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you choose to sign in, we create a session cookie to keep you
				logged in and we store account-related data in our database
				(e.g., your user ID and the content you choose to save such as
				highlights, saved items, or read-later lists). We do not require
				an account to read content.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Cookies and local storage</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Session cookie</strong>: When authentication is enabled
				and you sign in, an HTTP-only session cookie (named <code
					>__session</code
				>) is set to authenticate requests to our API. It is only used
				for security and identifying your account to save or retrieve
				your data (e.g., highlights or saved items).
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Local storage</strong>: We store UI preferences like
				theme (<code>theme</code>), Pāli mode (<code>paliMode</code>),
				Pāli word lookup preference (<code>paliLookup</code>), layout (<code
					>layout</code
				>), and font size (<code>fontSize</code>) in your browser. You
				can clear these at any time from your browser settings.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Authentication and account data</h3>
		<p>
			Sign-in is optional. If you sign in, we use Firebase Authentication
			to verify your identity and a server-managed session cookie to
			authorize requests. We may store your email address and a unique
			user ID provided by the authentication service. If you use features
			like “Save,” “Read later,” or “Highlights,” the data you create is
			stored in our database and associated with your account.
		</p>

		<h3>Analytics and performance</h3>
		<p>
			We use privacy-conscious analytics and performance tooling (e.g.,
			Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights) to understand site usage and
			performance. These services typically focus on aggregated and
			de-identified metrics to help improve the site.
		</p>

		<h3>Offline use and caching</h3>
		<p>
			This site supports offline use with a Service Worker (PWA). Your
			browser may cache pages and assets for faster loads and offline
			reading. Cached data lives on your device and can be cleared via
			your browser’s site data settings.
		</p>

		<h3>How we use your data</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide and improve the site and reading experience.</li>
			<li>
				Enable optional features tied to your account (e.g., highlights,
				saved items).
			</li>
			<li>Maintain the security and reliability of our services.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Data sharing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
			<li>
				We use trusted processors to operate the site (e.g., Firebase
				for authentication and data storage, and our hosting provider’s
				analytics). These processors handle data on our behalf under
				their own terms and privacy practices.
			</li>
			<li>
				We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the
				rights, property, or safety of our users and the public.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Data retention</h3>
		<p>
			Account-related data (if you sign in) is retained while your account
			remains active. You can request deletion of your account data at any
			time. Cached files on your device persist until your browser clears
			them based on its own policies or your manual action.
		</p>

		<h3>Your choices</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use the site without signing in. Most content is available
				without an account.
			</li>
			<li>Manage cookies and site data in your browser settings.</li>
			<li>
				Clear local storage and cached data in your browser at any time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Request access to or deletion of your account data if you have
				signed in.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Contact</h3>
		<p>
			For questions about this policy or to request access or deletion of
			your account data, email <a href="mailto:hello@wordsofthebuddha.org"
				>hello@wordsofthebuddha.org</a
			>.
		</p>

		<h3>Updates to this policy</h3>
		<p>
			We may update this policy to reflect changes to the site or legal
			requirements. We’ll update the “Effective date” above when we do.
