title: "Mindfulness of Body"
description: "Mindfulness of body is the practice of grounding awareness in the body as it is—through breathing, posture, activities, anatomical reflection, the elements, and contemplation of decay. Cultivated and frequently practiced, it steadies the mind, supports sense restraint and collectedness, and becomes a basis for deep tranquility and release."
