title: "Mindfulness of Breath"
description: "Mindfulness while breathing in and out is a practical application of right mindfulness, the seventh factor of the Noble Eightfold Path. This topic encompasses both the step-by-step training process and the resulting state of collectedness, where awareness becomes gathered and steady. It illustrates how this practice fosters deep tranquility, clarity, and the release of the mind from unwholesome qualities."
