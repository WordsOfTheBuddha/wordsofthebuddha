# Test Cases for "FIRE: An Inquiry into Recurrent Experience" (fire.mdx)

## How to Update This File

1. **User approval required.** Do not modify this file without user confirmation. Propose changes in conversation first.
2. **When to add test cases.** After discovering a new constraint (framing, logic, or coherence) during an edit, propose it as a new test case.
3. **When to modify test cases.** If an edit intentionally changes a prior decision (e.g., relabeling a triangle corner), update the affected test cases and flag which ones changed.
4. **Format.** Each test case has: an ID, a category, a short rule, and (optionally) a rationale or example. Keep rules tight — one sentence where possible.
5. **Checking.** Before making edits to fire.mdx, review relevant test cases. After editing, verify the result against them. If an edit violates a test case, either fix the edit or propose modifying the test case.

## A. Language — How to Frame

### A.0 Global Framing Rules

| ID    | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Rationale / Example                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A.0.1 | **Experience-first, not doctrine-first.** Frame claims in terms a reader can see, feel, or relate to before introducing Pali terms or doctrinal categories.                                                                       | "Seeing experiences as lasting, as leading to satisfaction, and as belonging to someone" — not "the failure to see experience as conditioned, impermanent, and not-self." |
| A.0.2 | **No preachy tone.** Avoid framing that presupposes the reader already accepts the conclusion. Do not instill a belief — describe what can be observed.                                                                           | Avoid: "the failure to see X." Prefer: "seeing X as Y" — let the reader check against their own experience.                                                               |
| A.0.3 | **Fire register first.** When a concept has both a fire-simile expression and a doctrinal expression, lead with the fire version. The Pali/doctrinal name follows in parentheses or popover.                                      | "The flame reaching for more" → then "(craving, taṇhā)".                                                                                                                  |
| A.0.4 | **Negation is earned, not assumed.** Don't negate something the essay has not first positively established. "Ignorance is not a side of the triangle" is unhelpful unless the reader was first given reason to think it might be. | If the analogy is presented cleanly, the reader never needs to be told what it isn't.                                                                                     |
| A.0.5 | **Popover syntax** for technical terms: `\|display text::definition [pali]\|`. Keep definitions tight.                                                                                                                            |
| A.0.6 | **Commentary footnotes** use `^[n]^` syntax, defined in frontmatter `commentary` array.                                                                                                                                           |
| A.0.7 | **No first-person framing** in fire-register passages. The fire does not say "I." When describing the process from fire's perspective, use third-person or impersonal constructions.                                              | "The flame loses its hold" — not "I no longer cling."                                                                                                                     |
| A.0.8 | **Don't narrate the reader's future insight.** When illustrating coarse perception, show only what coarse perception sees — not the refined version it will become. The practice sections (Part V) earn the contrast; the introduction should not pre-empt it. | Show: "A headache registers as 'I'm in pain.'" Don't add: "…but really it's a shifting pattern of pressure and release." |

### A.1 Part I — The Anatomy of a Flame

| ID    | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                | Rationale / Example                                                                 |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A.1.1 | **Three aspects of a photon** map to three aspects of a moment: luminosity → consciousness, wavelength → perception, amplitude → felt experience. These are inseparable.            | MN 43 ¶19 — they cannot be unpacked.                                                |
| A.1.2 | **Coarse vs. refined perception** is framed as wavelength resolution. Coarse = long wavelength, resolves only solid blocks. Refined = short wavelength, resolves momentary process. | MN 1 — conceiving as "mine" happens at coarse resolution.                           |
| A.1.3 | **Wisdom and consciousness** are inseparable but functionally distinct. Luminosity (the bare fact of shining) = consciousness. Illumination (what the light reveals, the clarity of what is seen) = wisdom. Every moment of light both shines and illuminates — they cannot be unpacked. | MN 43 ¶11–13 — "what one discerns, that one distinguishes." Wisdom should be developed; consciousness should be fully understood. |
| A.1.4 | **Formless abidings "illumination"** refers to the inseparable consciousness+wisdom pair, not consciousness alone. When the text says "the illumination turns back on itself," both luminosity and clarity are present. | This is consistent with A.1.3 — you can't have light without it illuminating something. |

### A.2 Part II — The Fire Triangle

| ID    | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                | Rationale / Example                                |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| A.2.1 | **The fire triangle is a brief structural overview** before Part III's detailed cascade. It introduces the three conditions; Part III unpacks how they play out step by step.       | Acts as a conceptual anchor that Part III expands. |
| A.2.2 | **Triangle labels should be concise** and follow the pattern "Fire-science term (Pali/doctrinal mapping)." e.g., "Fuel Bed (Saṅkhāra)."                                             | Parallel with existing "Oxygen (Craving)."         |
| A.2.3 | **Ignorance is framed experientially** — in terms a reader can recognize in their own experience (seeing things as lasting, as satisfying, as "mine") — not as a doctrinal failure. | See A.0.1, A.0.2.                                  |

### A.3 Part III — The Cascade

| ID    | Rule                                                                                                               | Rationale / Example                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A.3.1 | **Nine cascade steps** from SN 14.9 map to fire-spreading phases. Each step has a fire label and an element label. | Fuel bed, Tinder, Kindling, Spark, Heat, Reaching, Flare-up, Spreading, New Fuel. |
| A.3.2 | **Intervention point** is between Feeling and Desire — the green dashed line. This is the critical juncture.       | SN 36.6 — two arrows: bodily vs. mental.                                          |

### A.4 Part IV — Where the Next Fire Catches

| ID    | Rule                                                                                                                                                    | Rationale / Example                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| A.4.1 | **AN 3.76 agriculture metaphor** uses noun-framing (kamma as field, consciousness as seed, craving as moisture). Flag this as conventional language.    | Footnotes ^[2]^ and ^[3]^ handle this. |
| A.4.2 | **Three terrains** map to three realms: inferior (sensual), middling (form), sublime (formless). Fire character differs by terrain, not by "soul type." |                                        |

### A.5 Part V — The Spectrum of Flames

| ID    | Rule                                                                                                                               | Rationale / Example                                                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A.5.1 | **Formless abidings use luminosity/illumination**, not "awareness." These stay in fire register.                                   | Boundless consciousness = "the luminosity itself"; nothingness = "the illumination settles on absence." |
| A.5.2 | **Cessation vs. death** — both flames are out, but cessation has hot embers/unspent fuel; death has cold ash and broken faculties. | MN 43 ¶57.                                                                                              |
| A.5.3 | **Cascade Revisited** diagram shows progressive intervention points. Each practice cuts the cascade at an earlier step.            | Wisdom → Jhānas → Formless → Neither-P → Cessation.                                                     |

### A.6 Part VI — Nibbāna

| ID    | Rule                                                                                                                                                                               | Rationale / Example                                        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| A.6.1 | **"Where did the fire go?"** is the central rhetorical device. The question dissolves — fire was never a thing.                                                                    | MN 72.                                                     |
| A.6.2 | **The Great Relief** uses the excited-electron analogy: ignorance kicks the system into an excited state, compulsive emission follows. The end is not a stable flame but no flame. | Ignorance here is a causal condition, not a triangle side. |

## B. Logic — What Can't Be Conveyed / Constraints

| ID  | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Rationale / Example                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B.1 | **Consciousness cannot be both flame and fuel in the same role.** Consciousness-as-clung-to (upādānakkhandha) is combustible material — part of the fuel. Consciousness-as-process (viññāṇa in the DO chain) is the flame. Same substance, different role — like a candle's wax (fuel) and the flame (made of vaporized wax). The five aggregates subject to clinging can include consciousness without circularity because the clung-to version is stored material, the active version is the burning event. | Wax/flame analogy resolves the apparent circularity. |
| B.2 | **Intention (cetanā) ≠ Intentional constructs (saṅkhāra).** Cetanā is a specific mental factor (one component of name-and-form). Saṅkhāra is the broader aggregate of volitional formations. If saṅkhāra occupies one corner of the triangle, cetanā can appear inside the cascade or the fuel without contradiction — but they should not be conflated. | Part III uses "Intention" for cetanā. The triangle uses "Saṅkhāra." They are related but distinct.                                                                                       |
| B.3 | **The fire triangle and Part III cascade must be structurally compatible.** The triangle is the overview; the cascade is the detailed sequence. The heat side of the triangle (name-and-form) unfolds as cascade steps 2–5 (perception → intention → contact → feeling). Step 1 (elements/fuel bed) is the ground — not part of the triangle itself. Saṅkhāra is not a triangle side but the ground/conditioning beneath it — the accumulated prior kamma that shapes what fuel is available and how name-and-form is arranged. This connects to Part IV where kamma = field. | Cascade steps 1–5 ARE the heat side unfolding step by step. |
| B.4 | **Sutta citations must reflect actual sutta content.** When paraphrasing, preserve the essential claim. When quoting, use exact text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | SN 36.6 says "two feelings — bodily and mental," not "two arrows of feeling and craving."                                                                                                |
| B.5 | **Upādāna = fuel (literally).** This etymology is established in the introduction and must hold throughout. Whatever occupies the fuel side of the triangle must connect to what upādāna refers to — the aggregates that are clung to.                                                                                                                   | Intro line ~36 establishes this.                                                                                                                                                         |
| B.6 | **Ignorance is a condition for the triangle, not a side of it.** Dependent on ignorance, intentional constructs arise (MN 38 ¶67). Ignorance is prior to the triangle's operation.                                                                                                                                                                       | The triangle depicts what sustains ongoing combustion; ignorance is why combustion happens at all.                                                                                       |
| B.7 | **"Remove any side and the fire goes out" must hold for each side.** Remove fuel (clinging ends) → consciousness ceases → Arahantship. Remove heat (name-and-form in active mode ceases — contact, feeling, perception, intention stop) → cessation of perception and what is felt → definitive Nibbāna (AN 9.47, MN 43 ¶57). Remove oxygen (craving ends) → no reactive medium → Arahantship. Each maps to a recognizable attainment. Note: the essay need not name these attainments explicitly at the triangle — the logic holds beneath the framing. | SN 12.64 sunbeam demonstrates the craving side. MN 43 ¶57 demonstrates the heat side (cessation vs. death). |
| B.8 | **The MN 38 ¶91 cessation quote** describes dependent origination in reverse (ignorance → saṅkhāra → consciousness). This is the DO chain, not the triangle itself. The prose around it should correctly map triangle-cessation without conflating with DO-chain-cessation.                                                                              | The DO chain and the fire triangle overlap but are not identical.                                                                                                                        |
| B.9 | **No paradox in formless descriptions.** E.g., calling something "tinder" when the point is the absence of fuel. If a term implies presence, it shouldn't describe absence.                                                                                                                                                                              | Nothingness conclusion: "subtlest possible luminosity" not "subtlest possible tinder."                                                                                                   |

## C. Coherence — Respecting What's Established in Other Parts

| ID  | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Rationale / Example                                                                                                         |

| C.1 | **Part I's photon analogy is the foundation.** Any later use of wavelength, amplitude, luminosity must be consistent with Part I's definitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Coarse/refined perception = long/short wavelength. Amplitude = felt experience intensity. Luminosity = consciousness.       |
| C.2 | **"Fire is named by its fuel"** (MN 38 ¶22) is established in the intro and repeated in Part II. The fuel side of the triangle must be what consciousness is named by — what it stands on, what it burns.                                                                                                                                                                            | Log fire, grass fire → eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness.                                                                |
| C.3 | **Part III's cascade labels must match Part V's "Cascade Revisited."** Same nine phases, same fire labels, same element labels. Part V adds intervention lines but does not rename phases.                                                                                                                                                                                           | fuel bed, tinder, kindling, spark, heat, reaching, flare-up, spreading, new fuel.                                           |
| C.4 | **The seed simile (SN 22.54, footnote [4])** and the agriculture simile (AN 3.76, Part IV) must not contradict. SN 22.54: consciousness = seed, four aggregates = earth. AN 3.76: consciousness = seed, kamma = field, craving = moisture. Both use "seed" for consciousness. The "earth" and "field" are different framings (aggregates vs. kamma) for different teaching purposes. |                                                                                                                             |
| C.5 | **Part VI's "The Great Relief"** uses ignorance as a causal condition (what excites the system). This is compatible with ignorance as background condition of the triangle (B.6) — but the wording must not reintroduce ignorance as fuel.                                                                                                                                           | "Ignorance creates the instability" — a cause, not a combustion input.                                                      |
| C.6 | **Part VI's cessation line** must match the triangle's labels. Currently: "Remove the fuel (clinging ends)." If the fuel side changes label, this line must update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                             |
| C.7 | **"Upādāna = fuel" thread** must be traceable: intro (line ~36) → Part II (triangle's fuel corner) → Part VI (cessation). A reader following this thread should find consistent usage.                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                             |
| C.8 | **Part II → Part III continuity.** The triangle's heat side (name-and-form) unfolds as the cascade's first five steps. The fuel (what is clung to) is the stored material the cascade burns through. Craving (oxygen) appears as the atmosphere sustaining the whole sequence. A reader should recognize the triangle's conditions operating within the cascade. | The cascade IS the triangle in motion — the "how" of the "what." |
| C.9 | **Formless abidings fire register** — Parts V uses luminosity/illumination/light for consciousness-related terms in the formless abidings. These must not regress to "awareness" in any edit.                                                                                                                                                                                        | See A.5.1.                                                                                                                  |
