“Tisso imā, bhikkhave, vedanā. Katamā tisso?

Sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā—imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso vedanāti.

Sukhaṁ vā yadi vā dukkhaṁ,
adukkhamasukhaṁ saha;
Ajjhattañca bahiddhā ca,
yaṁ kiñci atthi veditaṁ.

Etaṁ dukkhanti ñatvāna,
mosadhammaṁ palokinaṁ;
Phussa phussa vayaṁ passaṁ,
evaṁ tattha virajjatī”ti.
