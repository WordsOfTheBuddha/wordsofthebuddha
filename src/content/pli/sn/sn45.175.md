“Sattime, bhikkhave, anusayā. Katame satta?

Kāmarāgānusayo,
paṭighānusayo,
diṭṭhānusayo,
vicikicchānusayo,
mānānusayo,
bhavarāgānusayo,
avijjānusayo.

Ime kho, bhikkhave, sattānusayā.

Imesaṁ kho, bhikkhave, sattannaṁ anusayānaṁ abhiññāya pariññāya parikkhayāya pahānāya …pe… ayaṁ ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo bhāvetabbo”ti.
