slug: sn1.5
commentary:
    - When the deity asks how many should one cut off and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five lower fetters of view of personal existence, doubt, adherence to rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill will. One needs to cut these off.
    - When the deity asks how many should one abandon and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five higher fetters of desire for fine-material existence, desire for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. One needs to abandon these.
    - When the deity asks how many should one develop and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five spiritual faculties of |confidence::faith|, energy, mindfulness, |collectedness::concentration|, and wisdom. One needs to develop these.
    - When the deity asks how many clinging should one overcome and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five clinging aggregates of form, feeling, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness. One needs to overcome these. When one has overcome these five clinging, one is said to have crossed over the flood of suffering.

Sāvatthinidānaṁ.

Ekamantaṁ ṭhitā kho sā devatā bhagavato santike imaṁ gāthaṁ abhāsi:

“Kati chinde kati jahe,
kati cuttari bhāvaye;
Kati saṅgātigo bhikkhu,
oghatiṇṇoti vuccatī”ti.

“Pañca chinde pañca jahe,
pañca cuttari bhāvaye;
Pañca saṅgātigo bhikkhu,
oghatiṇṇoti vuccatī”ti.
