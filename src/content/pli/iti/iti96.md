Vuttañhetaṁ bhagavatā vuttamarahatāti me sutaṁ:

“Kāmayogayutto, bhikkhave, bhavayogayutto āgāmī hoti āgantā itthattaṁ. Kāmayogavisaṁyutto, bhikkhave, bhavayogayutto anāgāmī hoti anāgantā itthattaṁ. Kāmayogavisaṁyutto, bhikkhave, bhavayogavisaṁyutto arahā hoti, khīṇāsavo”ti.

Etamatthaṁ bhagavā avoca. Tatthetaṁ iti vuccati:

“Kāmayogena saṁyuttā,
bhavayogena cūbhayaṁ;
Sattā gacchanti saṁsāraṁ,
jātimaraṇagāmino.

Ye ca kāme pahantvāna,
appattā āsavakkhayaṁ;
Bhavayogena saṁyuttā,
anāgāmīti vuccare.

Ye ca kho chinnasaṁsayā,
khīṇamānapunabbhavā;
Te ve pāraṅgatā loke,
ye pattā āsavakkhayan”ti.

Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā, iti me sutanti.
