Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa.

Buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,
Dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,
Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

Dutiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,
Dutiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,
Dutiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

Tatiyampi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,
Tatiyampi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,
Tatiyampi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.
