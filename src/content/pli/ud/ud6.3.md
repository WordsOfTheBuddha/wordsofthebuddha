title: Paccavekkhaṇa sutta - Reviewing
description: The Buddha reviews the multitude of harmful and unwholesome mental qualities he has abandoned, and the multitude of wholesome mental qualities he has developed to completion.
fetter: ignorance
tags: harmful, unwholesome, mental qualities, abandoned, wholesome, developed, completion, ud, ud6
slug: ud6.3
commentary: "[1] I suspect that the verse refers to a review of harmful and unwholesome mental qualities done one at a time. This process is to show that an awakened being carefully examines and verifies things as they have come to be instead of assuming or jumping to conclusions."

Evaṁ me sutaṁ— ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā attano aneke pāpake akusale dhamme pahīne paccavekkhamāno nisinno hoti, aneke ca kusale dhamme bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gate.

Atha kho bhagavā attano aneke pāpake akusale dhamme pahīne viditvā aneke ca kusale dhamme bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gate tāyaṁ velāyaṁ imaṁ udānaṁ udānesi:

“Ahu pubbe tadā nāhu,
nāhu pubbe tadā ahu;
Na cāhu na ca bhavissati,
na cetarahi vijjatī”ti. [1]
