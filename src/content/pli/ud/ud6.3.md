Evaṁ me sutaṁ— ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā attano aneke pāpake akusale dhamme pahīne paccavekkhamāno nisinno hoti, aneke ca kusale dhamme bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gate.

Atha kho bhagavā attano aneke pāpake akusale dhamme pahīne viditvā aneke ca kusale dhamme bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gate tāyaṁ velāyaṁ imaṁ udānaṁ udānesi:
