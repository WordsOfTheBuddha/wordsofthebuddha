"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? The person who is like \|a line etched on rock::an inscription on rock [pāsāṇalekhūpama]|, the person who is like a line etched on ground, and the person who is like a line etched on water.

1 And what, bhikkhus, is the person who is like a line etched on rock? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person frequently gets angry, and his anger persists for a long time. Just as a line etched on rock is not quickly eroded by wind or water but persists for a long time, in the same way, such a person frequently gets angry, and his anger persists for a long time. This, bhikkhus, is called the person who is like a line etched on rock.

2 And what, bhikkhus, is the person who is like a line etched on ground? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person frequently gets angry, but his anger does not persist for a long time. Just as a line etched on ground is quickly eroded by wind or water and does not persist for a long time, in the same way, such a person frequently gets angry, but his anger does not persist for a long time. This, bhikkhus, is called the person who is like a line etched on ground.

3 And what, bhikkhus, is the person who is like a line etched on water? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, even when spoken to harshly, offensively, or unpleasantly; |reconciles::remains connected [sandhiyati]|, |interacts::harmonizes [saṃsandati]|, and \|responds amicably::is cordial [sammodati]|. Just as a line etched on water quickly disappears and does not persist for a long time, in the same way, such a person, even when spoken to harshly, offensively, or unpleasantly, immediately reconciles, harmonizes and responds amicably. This, bhikkhus, is called the person who is like a line etched on water.

These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."
