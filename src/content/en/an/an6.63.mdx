“I will teach you, bhikkhus, the penetrative exposition, the dhamma exposition. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

“And what, bhikkhus, is the penetrative exposition, the dhamma exposition? Sensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the result of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the ending of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the way of practice leading to the ending of sensual pleasures is to be understood.

Feelings, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of feelings is to be understood; the diversity of feelings is to be understood; the result of feelings is to be understood; the ending of feelings is to be understood; the way of practice leading to the ending of feelings is to be understood.

Perceptions, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of perceptions is to be understood; the diversity of perceptions is to be understood; the result of perceptions is to be understood; the ending of perceptions is to be understood; the way of practice leading to the ending of perceptions is to be understood.

Taints, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of taints is to be understood; the diversity of taints is to be understood; the result of taints is to be understood; the ending of taints is to be understood; the way of practice leading to the ending of taints is to be understood.

|Actions::kamma|, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of actions is to be understood; the diversity of actions is to be understood; the result of actions is to be understood; the ending of actions is to be understood; the way of practice leading to the ending of actions is to be understood.

|Suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, bhikkhus, is to be understood; the origin of suffering is to be understood; the diversity of suffering is to be understood; the result of suffering is to be understood; the ending of suffering is to be understood; the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering is to be understood.

Sensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the result of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the ending of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the way of practice leading to the ending of sensual pleasures is to be understood. And what is the basis for this statement? There are these five cords of sensual pleasure: 1) |Forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]| cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and |enticing::arousing, tantalizing [rajanīya]|, 2) |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]| cognizable by the ear that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing, 3) |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]| cognizable by the nose that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing, 4) |tastes::flavors experienced through the tongue such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes like umami or astringency—any gustatory experience that can become an object of craving, indulgence, comfort, or sensory delight [rasā]| cognizable by the tongue that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing, and 5) |tangible objects::tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| cognizable by the body that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. However, these are not sensual pleasures; these are sensual cords, in the discipline of the Noble Ones, it is said:

The passion and desire for them is the sensual pleasure,
The things in the world that are beautiful,
The passion and desire for them is the sensual pleasure,
They remain beautiful in the world,
But the wise abandon desire for them.

And what, bhikkhus, is the origin of sensual pleasures? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of sensual pleasures.

And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of sensual pleasures? One kind of desire arises from forms, another kind of desire arises from sounds, another kind of desire arises from odors, another kind of desire arises from tastes, another kind of desire arises from tangibles. This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.

And what, bhikkhus, is the result of sensual pleasures? Bhikkhus, the one who desires and delights in sensual pleasures, by that very desire, produces repeated existence in favorable or unfavorable conditions. This is called the result of sensual pleasures.

And what, bhikkhus, is the ending of sensual pleasures? The ending of contact, bhikkhus, is the ending of sensual pleasures. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the way of practice leading to the ending of sensual pleasures, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.

When a noble disciple thus understands sensual pleasures, understands the origin of sensual pleasures, understands the diversity of sensual pleasures, understands the result of sensual pleasures, understands the ending of sensual pleasures, understands the way of practice leading to the ending of sensual pleasures, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the ending of sensual pleasures.
