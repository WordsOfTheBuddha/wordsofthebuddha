“Bhikkhus, if there were no |gratification::satisfaction, pleasure, enjoyment, sweetness [assāda]| in the world, beings would not be |infatuated::enamoured, attracted [sārajjati]| with it. But because there is gratification in the world, beings become infatuated with it.

Bhikkhus, if there were no |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| in the world, beings would not become |disenchanted with::disillusioned with [nibbindati]| it. But because there is drawback in the world, beings become disenchanted with it.

Bhikkhus, if there were no |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| from the world, beings would not escape from it. But because there is an escape from the world, beings escape from it.

So long, bhikkhus, as beings have not |experientially understood::directly known, realized [abbhaññāsi]|, |as they truly are::as they have come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|, the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape with regard to the world, they have not escaped from this world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion; lit. causing death [mārake]|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners; nor are they |disentangled from::disengaged from, detached from, unfettered from [visaṁyutta]| it, nor fully released from it, nor do they dwell with a |mind rid of barriers::unrestricted mind, boundless mind [vimariyādikata + cetasā]|.

But, bhikkhus, when beings have experientially understood, as they truly are, the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape with regard to the world, then they have escaped from this world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners; they are disentangled from it, fully released from it, and they dwell with a mind rid of barriers.”
