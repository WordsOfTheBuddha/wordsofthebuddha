“Bhikkhus, a |person lacking in integrity::unethical person, inferior person [asappurisa]| is to be recognized by four qualities. What four?

1.) Here, bhikkhus, a person lacking in integrity discloses the |faults::bad qualities [avaṇṇa]| of others even when not asked about them—how much more so when asked. But when he is asked, then, pressed by questions, he speaks of the faults of others without omission, fully and in detail. Bhikkhus, it should be recognized that such a person is one lacking in integrity.

2.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, a person lacking in integrity does not disclose the |good qualities::praiseworthy qualities, virtues [vaṇṇa]| of others, even when asked about them—how much less when not asked. But when he is asked, then, pressed by questions, he speaks of the good qualities of others only partially and without detail. Bhikkhus, it should be recognized that such a person is one lacking in integrity.”

3.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, a person lacking in integrity does not disclose his own faults even when asked about them—how much less when not asked. But when he is asked, then, pressed by questions, he speaks of his own faults only partially and without detail. Bhikkhus, it should be recognized that such a person is one lacking in integrity.

4.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, a person lacking in integrity discloses his own good qualities even when not asked about them—how much more so when asked. But when he is asked, then, pressed by questions, he speaks of his own good qualities without omission, fully and in detail. Bhikkhus, it should be recognized that such a person is one lacking in integrity. Bhikkhus, it is by these four qualities that a person lacking in integrity is to be recognized.

Just as, bhikkhus, when a young bride is first brought into the home, whether at night or during the day, she immediately sets up a keen |sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing::conscience and concern, respect for oneself and others [hirottappa]| toward her mother-in-law, her father-in-law, her husband, and even toward the household servants and workers. But after some time, as a result of living together and intimacy with them, she says to her mother-in-law, her father-in-law, and her husband: ‘Go away! What do you know?’ So too, when some bhikkhu here has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, whether by night or during the day, he sets up a keen sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing toward the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay followers, the female lay followers, and even toward the monastery workers and novices. But after some time, as a result of living together and intimacy with them, he says even to his teacher and his preceptor: ‘Go away! What do you know?’

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will dwell with a mind like that of a recently arrived young bride.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.”
