Thus have I heard — Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” responded the bhikkhus to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then spoke:

“Once, bhikkhus, I was dwelling near |Uruvelā::name of a town in Magadha, lit. broad banks [uruvelā]|, on the bank of the Nerañjarā River, at the foot of the goatherd’s banyan tree. There, having just attained full awakening and abiding in |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, a reflection arose in my mind: ‘One dwells in |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| if one is without respect and reverence. What if I were to honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on an ascetic or a brahmin?'

Then it occurred to me, bhikkhus: ‘It would be for the sake of completing an incomplete aggregate of |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]| that I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However, I see no one in the world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, who possesses virtue superior to my own, to whom I could honor and respect and dwell in dependence on.

It would be for the sake of completing an incomplete aggregate of |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| that I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However, I see no one in the world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, who possesses collectedness superior to my own, to whom I could honor and respect and dwell in dependence on.

It would be for the sake of completing an incomplete aggregate of |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]| that I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However, I see no one in the world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, who possesses wisdom superior to my own, to whom I could honor and respect and dwell in dependence on.

It would be for the sake of completing an incomplete aggregate of |liberation::release, deliverance, freedom, emancipation [vimutti]| that I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin. However, I see no one in the world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, who possesses liberation superior to my own, to whom I could honor and respect and dwell in dependence on.’

Thus, I considered: ‘Let me then honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on the very |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| to which I have fully awakened.’

Then, bhikkhus, |Brahmā Sahampati::name of the Brahma who inspired the Buddha to teach [sahampati]|, perceiving with his own mind the train of thought in my mind, just as easily as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, disappeared from the Brahmā world and reappeared before the Blessed One. He draped his outer robe over one shoulder and raised his hands in reverence towards the Blessed One, and said to him: ‘So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Well-Gone One! Venerable sir, those who were the |Arahant::a worthy one, an epithet of a fully awakened being [arahant]|s, |perfectly Awakened One::fully awakened being, fully enlightened being [sammāsambuddha]|s in the past—those Blessed Ones too honored, respected, and dwelled in dependence just on the Dhamma itself. Those who will be the Arahants, perfectly Awakened Ones in the future—those Blessed Ones too will honor, respect, and dwell in dependence just on the Dhamma itself. Let the Blessed One too, who is at present the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One, honor, respect, and dwell in dependence just on the Dhamma itself.’

This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said this, he further said:

'Those Buddhas of the past,
and those yet to arise;
and the one who is the Buddha now,
the removers of many sorrows.

All have dwelt, will dwell, and dwell,
deeply revering the true Dhamma;
For the Buddhas,
this is a natural law.

Therefore, those desiring their own good,
aspiring for excellence;
Should deeply revere the true Dhamma,
recollecting the Buddhas’ teaching.’

Having spoken these words, bhikkhus, Brahmā Sahampati paid homage to me, circumambulated me with his right side towards me, and then disappeared. Then, knowing both the Brahmā's request and recognizing what was appropriate for myself, I honored, respected, and lived in dependence on the very Dhamma to which I had fully awakened to. And since then, as the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| too has become endowed with greatness, I have come to hold reverence even for the Saṅgha.”
