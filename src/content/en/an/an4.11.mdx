### Toleration of harmful thoughts

"Bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is walking, a |thought of sensuality::thought related to enjoyment of sensual pleasures, sexual thought [kāmavitakka]|, a |thought of ill will::thought of resentment, anger, hatred [byāpādavitakka]| or a |thought of harming::idea of hurting, thought of cruelty [vihiṁsāvitakka]| arises, and if that bhikkhu tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, eliminate it, or bring it to an end, even while walking, such a bhikkhu is called 'unmotivated, |without concern::without regret, without remorse [anottāpī]|, constantly slack, and |weak in effort::low in energy, lacking in endurance [hīnavīriya]|.'

Bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is standing, a thought of sensuality, a thought of ill will or a thought of harming arises, and if that bhikkhu tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, eliminate it, or bring it to an end, even while standing, such a bhikkhu is called 'unmotivated, without concern, constantly slack, and weak in effort.'

Similarly, bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is sitting, a thought of sensuality, a thought of ill will or a thought of harming arises, and if that bhikkhu tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, eliminate it, or bring it to an end, even while sitting, such a bhikkhu is called 'unmotivated, without concern, constantly slack, and weak in effort.'

Similarly, bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is lying down but awake, a thought of sensuality, a thought of ill will or a thought of harming arises, and if that bhikkhu tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, eliminate it, or bring it to an end, even while lying down, such a bhikkhu is called 'unmotivated, without concern, constantly slack, and weak in effort.'

### Abandonment of harmful thoughts

Bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is walking, a thought of sensuality, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises, and if that bhikkhu does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, eliminates it, and brings it to an end, even while walking, such a bhikkhu is called '|with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, |with concern::with shame, with regret, having remorse [ottāpī]|, continuously |with energy aroused::with initiative [āraddhavīriya]|, and |determined::resolute, applying oneself [pahitatta]|.'

Bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is standing, a thought of sensuality, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises, and if that bhikkhu does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, eliminates it, and brings it to an end, even while standing, such a bhikkhu is called 'with continuous effort, with concern, continuously with energy aroused, and determined.'

Similarly, bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is sitting, a thought of sensuality, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises, and if that bhikkhu does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, eliminates it, and brings it to an end, even while sitting, such a bhikkhu is called 'with continuous effort, with concern, continuously with energy aroused, and determined.'

Likewise, bhikkhus, if while a bhikkhu is lying down but awake, a thought of sensuality, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises, and if that bhikkhu does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, eliminates it, and brings it to an end, even while lying down, such a bhikkhu is called 'with continuous effort, with concern, continuously with energy aroused, and determined.'

### Verse

Whether walking or standing,
sitting or lying down;
Whoever nurtures |harmful thoughts::thoughts which when acted upon lead to harm or injury or karmically unprofitable mental states [pāpaka + vitakka]|,
connected to the household life —

Such a one is |on the wrong path::following an incorrect way of practice [kummaggappaṭipanno]|,
|infatuated with defilements::fixated on what is unwholesome, deluded by what is impure [mohaneyyesu + mucchita]|;
That kind of bhikkhu is incapable,
of reaching the |highest::supreme, ultimate [uttama]| awakening.

But one who, whether walking or standing,
sitting or lying down;
Has |calmed::subsided, settled, stilled [samayitvāna]| their thoughts,
delighting in the |stilling of thoughts::settling the mind [vitakkūpasama]|;
That kind of bhikkhu is capable,
of reaching the highest awakening."
