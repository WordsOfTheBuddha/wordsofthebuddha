“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life.
Here again, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body.
Here again, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life.
Here again, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna without exertion after the breakup of the body.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the unpleasantness of food, recognizing disenchantment in the entire world, and observing impermanence in |all conditions::all activities, all processes, all fabrications, all formations [sabbasaṅkhāra]|. Moreover, the perception of death is well established within him. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|, the power of |sense of right and wrong::sense of shame, moral conscience, modesty [hiri]|, the power of |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]|, the power of |energy::persistence, willpower, determination [vīriya]|, and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop strongly in him: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed strongly in him, he attains final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceives the unpleasantness of food, recognizing disenchantment with the entire world, and observing impermanence in all conditions. Moreover, the perception of death is well established within him. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of faith, the power of sense of right and wrong, the power of fear of wrongdoing, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop softly in him: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed softly in him, he attains final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having secluded himself from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental qualities, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and is |imbued with joyful pleasure::imbued with joy and happiness, with delight and ease, sometimes experienced as an intense joy or pleasure, rapture [pītisukha]|. With the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with joyful pleasure. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, equanimous, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |ease::comfort, contentedness, happiness, pleasure [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful and at ease.’ With the abandonment of ease and |discontentment::discomfort, unpleasantness, something unsatisfactory, stress [dukkha]|, and with the settling down of |joy and sorrow::craving and aversion, pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, gladness and dejection, positive state of mind and negative state of mind [somanassadomanassa]|, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of confidence, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of persistence, and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop strongly in him: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed strongly in him, he attains final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna without exertion after the breakup of the body? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having secluded himself from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental qualities, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by reflection and examination, born of seclusion, and imbued with joyful pleasure. With the subsiding of reflection and examination, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal tranquility and unification of mind, free from reflection and examination, born of collectedness, and imbued with joyful pleasure. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells equanimous, mindful and fully aware, experiencing ease with the body. I entered and dwelled in the third jhāna which the Noble Ones describe as ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful and at ease.’ With the abandonment of ease and discontentment, and with the settling down of joy and sorrow, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of mindfulness through equanimity, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of confidence, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of persistence, and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop softly in him: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed softly in him, he attains final Nibbāna without exertion after the breakup of the body. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna without exertion after the breakup of the body.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
