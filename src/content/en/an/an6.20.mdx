At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Nātika::name of a village situated in the middle country of ancient India [nātika]| in the brick house. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, |recollection of death::keeping death in mind [maraṇassati]|, when cultivated and frequently practiced, is of great fruit and great benefit; it leads to the deathless and it |culminates in the deathless::ends in the deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amatapariyosāna]|. And how, bhikkhus, is recollection of death cultivated and frequently practiced so that it is of great fruit and great benefit; so that it leads to the deathless and culminates in the deathless?

Here, bhikkhus, when the day has elapsed and the night has approached, a bhikkhu reflects: ‘I could die on account of many causes: a snake might bite me, a scorpion might sting me, or a centipede might sting me. Through that, I might die and that would be an obstacle for me. Or I might trip and fall down, or the food I have eaten might turn out to be harmful, or my bile might flare up, or my phlegm might become disturbed, or piercing winds might flare up in me. Through that, I might die and that would be an obstacle for me.’ Therefore bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should reflect: ‘Do I have any |harmful::injurious, bad, or evil. Encompasses the deceptively alluring that is ultimately detrimental or ruinous [pāpaka]|, |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| that have not yet been abandoned, which would be an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight?’

If, bhikkhus, while |reviewing::reviewing on, looking at [paccavekkhamāna]|, a bhikkhu knows: ‘I have harmful, unwholesome mental qualities that have not yet been abandoned, which would be an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight,’ then he should arouse the utmost desire, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, kindle enthusiasm, maintain tireless determination, and apply |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| and |clear awareness::attentiveness, clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]|. Just as, bhikkhus, if one’s clothes or one’s head were on fire, one would arouse the utmost desire, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, kindle enthusiasm, maintain tireless determination, and apply mindfulness and clear awareness to extinguish that fire; so too, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu should arouse the utmost desire, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, enthusiasm, tireless determination, and apply mindfulness and clear awareness to abandon those harmful, unwholesome mental qualities.

However, bhikkhus, if while reviewing a bhikkhu knows: ‘There are no harmful, unwholesome mental qualities not yet abandoned in me that would be an obstacle if I were to die tonight,’ then, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu should dwell in that |joy and happiness::uplifting joy and gladness [pītipāmojja]|, training by day and night in wholesome mental qualities.

Here moreover, bhikkhus, when the night has passed and the day has approached, a bhikkhu reflects: ‘I could die on account of many causes: a snake might bite me, a scorpion might sting me, or a centipede might bite me. Through that, I might die and that would be an obstacle for me. Or I might trip and fall down, or the food I have eaten might turn out to be harmful, or my bile might flare up, or my phlegm might flare up, or piercing winds might flare up in me. Through that, I might die and that would be an obstacle for me.’ Therefore bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should reflect: ‘Do I have any harmful, unwholesome mental qualities that have not yet been abandoned, which would be an obstacle for me if I were to die today?’

If, bhikkhus, while reviewing, a bhikkhu knows: ‘I have harmful, unwholesome mental qualities that have not yet been abandoned, which would be an obstacle for me if I were to die today,’ then he should arouse the utmost desire, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, kindle enthusiasm, maintain tireless determination, and apply mindfulness and clear awareness. Just as, bhikkhus, if one’s clothes or one’s head were on fire, one would arouse the utmost desire, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, kindle enthusiasm, maintain tireless determination, and apply mindfulness and clear awareness to extinguish that fire; so too, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu should arouse the utmost desire, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, enthusiasm, tireless determination, and apply mindfulness and clear awareness to abandon those harmful, unwholesome mental qualities.

However, bhikkhus, if while reviewing a bhikkhu knows: ‘There are no harmful, unwholesome mental qualities not yet abandoned in me that would be an obstacle if I were to die today,’ then, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu should dwell in that joy and happiness, training by day and night in wholesome mental qualities.

This, bhikkhus, is how recollection of death is cultivated and frequently practiced so that it is of great fruit and great benefit; so that it leads to the deathless and culminates in the deathless.”
