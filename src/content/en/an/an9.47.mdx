“‘|Directly visible::evident, perceivable [sandiṭṭhika]| |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|, directly visible Nibbāna,’ friend, it is said. But to what extent, friend, did the Blessed One say that the Nibbāna is directly visible?”

“Here, friend, a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures <collapse>and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states,</collapse> enters and dwells in the first jhāna. To this extent, the Blessed One has spoken of the directly visible Nibbāna in a |provisional sense::qualified sense, in a certain respect [pariyāyena]|. ...

Further, friend, with the complete surpassing of the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|, the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |cessation of perception and feeling::ending of recognition and felt experience, cessation of conception and what is felt [saññāvedayitanirodha]|, and having seen with wisdom, his |mental defilements::mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]| are completely exhausted. To this extent, the Blessed One has spoken of the directly visible Nibbāna in the |definitive sense::literal sense, ultimate sense [nippariyāyena]|.”
