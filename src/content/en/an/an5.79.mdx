“Bhikkhus, there are these five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them, and having recognized them, you should strive to abandon them.

What five? 1.) In the future, bhikkhus, there will be bhikkhus |undeveloped in body::physically unrestrained [abhāvitakāya]|, |undeveloped in virtue::uncultivated in ethical conduct [abhāvitasīla]|, |undeveloped in mind::uncultivated in mind [abhāvitacitta]|, and |undeveloped in wisdom::uncultivated in understanding [abhāvitapañña]|. Being undeveloped in body, virtue, mind, and wisdom, they will give full ordination to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These newly ordained bhikkhus too will become undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Being undeveloped in body, virtue, mind, and wisdom, they too will give full ordination to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. Those too will become undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Thus, bhikkhus, from the |corruption::defilement [sandosa]| of the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| comes the corruption of the |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|; from the corruption of the Vinaya comes the corruption of the Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the first future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it, and having recognized it, you should strive to abandon it.

2.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Being undeveloped in body, virtue, mind, and wisdom, they will give |dependence::A Vinaya procedure where a junior bhikkhu or bhikkhunī apprentices under a qualified senior monastic, typically their preceptor or teacher. This period of dependence normally lasts for the first five years following full ordination. [nissaya]| to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These newly guided bhikkhus too will become undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Being undeveloped in body, virtue, mind, and wisdom, they too will give dependence to others but will not be able to discipline them in the higher virtuous behavior, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. Those too will become undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Thus, bhikkhus, from the corruption of the Dhamma comes the corruption of the Vinaya; from the corruption of the Vinaya comes the corruption of the Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the second future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it, and having recognized it, you should strive to abandon it.

3.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Being undeveloped in body, virtue, mind, and wisdom, when engaging in |discussion about the Dhamma::detailed talk about the teaching; lit. talk about the Dhamma [abhidhammakathā]| and |questions and answers::lit. to be split apart [vedalla]|, they will fall into a dark Dhamma and will not realize it. Thus, bhikkhus, from the corruption of the Dhamma comes the corruption of the Vinaya; from the corruption of the Vinaya comes the corruption of the Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the third future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it, and having recognized it, you should strive to abandon it.

4.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Being undeveloped in body, virtue, mind, and wisdom, when those discourses spoken by the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| that are profound, deep in meaning, supra-mundane, and connected with emptiness are being recited, they will not listen, will not lend an ear, and will not apply their minds to understand them. They will not think those teachings should be learned or mastered. But as for those discourses that are composed by poets, poetical, sweet sounding and well-worded, created by outsiders, spoken by disciples are being recited, they will listen, lend an ear, and apply their minds to understand them. They will think those teachings should be learned and mastered. Thus, bhikkhus, from the corruption of the Dhamma comes the corruption of the Vinaya; from the corruption of the Vinaya comes the corruption of the Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the fourth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it, and having recognized it, you should strive to abandon it.

5.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. Being undeveloped in body, virtue, mind, and wisdom, the elder bhikkhus will become |indulgent::excessive, living luxuriously, extravagant [bāhulika]| and |careless::loose, lethargic, lax [sāthalika]|, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion. They will not rouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Later generations will follow their example. They too will become indulgent and careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion. They will not rouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. Thus, bhikkhus, from the corruption of the Dhamma comes the corruption of the Vinaya; from the corruption of the Vinaya comes the corruption of the Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the fifth future peril as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize it, and having recognized it, you should strive to abandon it.

These, bhikkhus, are the five future perils as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You should recognize them, and having recognized them, you should strive to abandon them.”
