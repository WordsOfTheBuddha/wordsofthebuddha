"Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who develops and frequently practices these five qualities can expect one of two results: either final |knowledge::enlightenment| in this very life or, if there is a trace of clinging left, the state of non-returning.

What are these five?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort,

develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy and accompanied by intentional effort,

develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and active effort and accompanied by intentional effort,

develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort,

enthusiasm itself makes the fifth.

Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who develops and frequently practices these five qualities can expect one of two results: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a trace of clinging left, the state of non-returning."
