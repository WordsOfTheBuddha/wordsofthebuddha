Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus."

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, there are these seven powers. What seven? The power of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|, the power of |energy::willpower, determination [vīriya]|, the power of |conscience::internal sense of right and wrong used for guiding one's behavior, moral shame, scruple [hirī]|, the power of |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]|, the power of |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]|, the power of |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|, and the power of |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]|. These, bhikkhus, are the seven powers.

The power of faith, the power of energy,
the power of conscience and of fear of wrongdoing;
The power of mindfulness and of collectedness,
and wisdom, the seventh power;
By these, the bhikkhu, strong and wise,
abides in |contentment::ease, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]|.

Examining the Dhamma thoroughly,
he deeply sees the meaning with wisdom;
Like the |quenching::going out [nibbāna]| of a lamp,
there is |deliverance::release, emancipation, freedom [vimokkha]| of the mind.”
