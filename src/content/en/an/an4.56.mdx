"Bhikkhus, if both husband and wife wish to see one another in this very life and to meet one another again in the next life, both should be |with the same faith::alike in confidence [samasaddha]|, |with the same ethical conduct::alike in virtue, morality [samasīlā]|, |with the same generosity::alike in giving [samacāga]|, and |with the same wisdom::alike in understanding [samapañña]|. Then they will see one another in this very life, and they will meet one another again in the next life."

"Both are faithful and generous,
restrained and living in accordance with the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|;
They become husband and wife,
speaking kindly to one another.

Then plentiful benefits arise [for them],
and they dwell in ease;
Their enemies are dejected,
when both are the same in ethical conduct.

Having lived by the Dhamma here,
both with the same precepts and practices;
They delight [after death] in a heavenly world,
pleased, enjoying sensual pleasures."
