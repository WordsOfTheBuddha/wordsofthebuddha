Bhikkhus, there are these five ways for removing |resentment::annoyance, irritation, loathing; lit. collision [āghāta]| by means of which resentment that has arisen in a bhikkhu should be completely removed. What five?

1.) Bhikkhus, in whomever resentment might arise, |loving-kindness::goodwill, friendliness, benevolence [metta]| should be cultivated toward that person. Thus, the resentment toward that person should be removed.

2.) Bhikkhus, in whomever resentment might arise, |compassion::mental quality of wise empathy in response to suffering, which counters qualities of harm or cruelty [karuṇā]| should be cultivated toward that person. Thus, the resentment toward that person should be removed.

3.) Bhikkhus, in whomever resentment might arise, |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkha]| should be cultivated toward that person. Thus, the resentment toward that person should be removed.

4.) Bhikkhus, in whomever resentment might arise, disregarding and non-attention should be applied toward that person. Thus, the resentment toward that person should be removed.

5.) Bhikkhus, in whomever resentment might arise, reflection on kamma should be determined toward that person: ‘This venerable is the owner of his actions, heir to his actions, born of his actions, related to his actions, supported by his actions. Whatever actions he does, whether good or bad, he will be the heir of those.’ Thus, the resentment toward that person should be removed.

Bhikkhus, these are the five ways to remove resentment by means of which resentment that has arisen in a bhikkhu should be completely removed.
