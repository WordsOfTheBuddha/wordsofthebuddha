“Bhikkhus, there are these three types of persons existing in the world. What three? The person with a mind like a sore, the person with a mind like lightning, and the person with a mind like a diamond.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person with a mind like a sore? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is irritable, very afflicted; even when lightly criticized, they become upset, angry, resentful, and show hatred and displeasure. Just as, bhikkhus, an open sore, when struck by wood or struck by a stone, discharges even more, so too, bhikkhus, here a certain person is irritable, very afflicted; even when lightly criticized, they become upset, angry, resentful, and show hatred and displeasure. This is called the person with a mind like sore.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person with a mind like lightning? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person understands as it really is: 'This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|'; 'This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|'; 'This is the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|'; 'This is the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.' Just as, bhikkhus, a person with sight in the dark of the night sees forms by a flash of lightning, so too, bhikkhus, here a certain person understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'; 'This is the arising of suffering'; 'This is the end of suffering'; 'This is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering.' This is called the person with a mind like lightning.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person with a mind like a diamond? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, through the wearing away of the |taints::defilements, pollutants [āsava]|, realizes with direct knowledge and attains in this very life, the taintless |liberation of mind::emancipated by mind/heart, samādhi obtained from fruition [cetovimutti]| and |liberation by wisdom::emancipation by insight [paññāvimutti]|, and dwells in it. Just as, bhikkhus, there is nothing that can break a diamond, whether it be a gem or a rock, so too, bhikkhus, here a certain person, through the wearing away of the taints, realizes with direct knowledge and attains in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and dwells in it. This is called the person with a mind like a diamond.

These, bhikkhus, are the three types of persons existing in the world.”
