"Bhikkhus, there are these three types of persons existing in the world. What three? The person with a mind like a sore, the person with a mind like lightning, and the person with a mind like a diamond.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person with a mind like a sore? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is irritable, very afflicted; even when lightly criticized, they become upset, angry, resentful, and show hatred and displeasure. Just as, bhikkhus, an open sore, when struck by wood or struck by a stone, discharges even more, so too, bhikkhus, here a certain person is irritable, very afflicted; even when lightly criticized, they become upset, angry, resentful, and show hatred and displeasure. This is called the person with a mind like sore.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person with a mind like lightning? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'; 'This is the origin of suffering'; 'This is the ending of suffering'; 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.' Just as, bhikkhus, a person with sight in the dark of the night sees forms by a flash of lightning, so too, bhikkhus, here a certain person understands as it really is: 'This is suffering'; 'This is the origin of suffering'; 'This is the ending of suffering'; 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.' This is called the person with a mind like lightning.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person with a mind like a diamond? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, through the wearing away of the |taints::defilements|, realizes with direct knowing and attains in this very life the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and dwells in it. Just as, bhikkhus, there is nothing that can break a diamond, whether it be a gem or a rock, so too, bhikkhus, here a certain person, through the wearing away of the |taints::defilements|, realizes with direct knowing and attains in this very life the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and dwells in it. This is called the person with a mind like a diamond.

These, bhikkhus, are the three types of persons existing in the world."
