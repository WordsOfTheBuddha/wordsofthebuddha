At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Vulture Peak mountain. Then Sutavā, the wanderer, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After the exchange of courteous and polite conversation, he sat down to one side. After conversing, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:

"Venerable sir, one time, while dwelling here in Rājagaha at the mountain cave, I directly heard and learned from the Blessed One: 'He who, Sutavā, is a bhikkhu who is an arahant, whose defilements are destroyed, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, who has achieved the highest goal, |who has exhausted the fetter of existence::who has worn away the bonds of continued conditional existence, i.e. the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojana]|, and who is liberated through complete comprehension, he is incapable of transgressing in five ways — incapable of intentionally taking the life of a living being, incapable of taking what is not given, incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse, incapable to knowingly speak falsely, and incapable to use stored up goods as he did before, when he was a householder. Is it true, venerable sir, that this was well heard, well learned, well attended to, and well retained by me?"

"Indeed, Sutavā, this was well heard, well learned, well attended to, and well retained by you. Before and now, I declare: 'A bhikkhu who is an arahant, whose defilements are destroyed, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, who has achieved the highest goal, who has exhausted the fetter of existence, and who is liberated through complete comprehension, is incapable of transgressing in nine ways — incapable of intentionally take the life of a living being, incapable of taking what is not given, incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse, incapable to knowingly speak falsely, incapable to use stored-up goods as he did before, when he was a householder, incapable to act out of |impulse::based on desire|, incapable to act out of |aversion::based on ill will|, incapable to act out of |delusion::tendency of the mind to not closely examine and verify|, and incapable to act out of fear.' Before and now, I declare: 'He who is a bhikkhu who is an arahant, whose defilements are destroyed, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, who has achieved the highest goal, who has exhausted the fetter of existence, and who is liberated through complete comprehension is incapable of transgressing in these nine ways.'"
