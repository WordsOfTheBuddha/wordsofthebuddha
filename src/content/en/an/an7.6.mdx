“Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of wealth. What seven? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtue, the wealth of conscience, the wealth of fear of wrongdoing, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones has confidence, is convinced in the awakening of the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|, acknowledging: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, a teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One.’ This is called the wealth of faith.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from divisive speech, abstains from harsh speech, abstains from idle chatter, abstains from alcoholic drinks and drugs that cause heedlessness. This is called the wealth of virtue.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of |conscience::internal sense of right and wrong used for guiding one’s behavior, moral shame, scruple [hirī]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones possesses moral conscience; he is ashamed of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct, and is ashamed of acquiring |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]|, unwholesome states. This is called the wealth of conscience.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones fears wrongdoing; he dreads misconduct by body, speech, and mind; he dreads acquiring harmful, unwholesome states. This is called the wealth of fear of wrongdoing.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of |learning::studying, understanding, acquiring knowledge [suta]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and consolidates what he has learned. Those teachings that are beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, that are meaningful and well-expressed, that proclaim the perfectly complete and purified spiritual life—such teachings as these he has learned extensively, remembered, recited verbally, mentally examined, and thoroughly penetrated by view. This is called the wealth of learning.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of |generosity::sharing, relinquishment [cāga]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones dwells at home with a mind free from the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, responsive to requests, delighting in sharing gifts. This is called the wealth of generosity.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with wisdom that discerns the |arising and passing away::appearance and disappearance, formation and dissolution [udayatthagāmī]|, which is noble and penetrative, |leading to the complete ending of suffering::leading to extinction of stress, leading to gradual and complete wearing away of discontentment [dukkhakkhayagāmī]|. This is called the wealth of wisdom.

These, bhikkhus, are the seven kinds of wealth.

The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtue,
The wealth of conscience and of fear of wrongdoing;
The wealth of learning and generosity,
And wisdom as the seventh wealth.

Whoever possesses these wealths,
whether a woman or a man;
is said not to be poor,
their life is truly |not in vain::fruitful [amogha]|.

Therefore, the wise should apply themselves,
to the cultivation of faith and virtue,
to clearly see the |Dhamma::the ultimate truth that the Buddha’s teachings point to [dhamma]|,
recollecting the Buddhas’ dispensation.”
