“Bhikkhus, a woman binds a man in eight ways. What eight?

1) A woman binds a man with crying;
2) A woman binds a man with |laughter::smile [hasita]|;
3) A woman binds a man with |talk::speech [bhaṇita]|;
4) A woman binds a man with |deportment::conduct, behavior [ākappa]|;
5) A woman binds a man with a |gift::a present such as flowers or fruits, lit. broken off from the wood [vanabhaṅga]|;
6) A woman binds a man with |scent::fragrance [gandha]|;
7) A woman binds a man with |taste::flavor [rasa]|;
8) A woman binds a man with touch.

These, bhikkhus, are the eight ways in which a woman binds a man. And, bhikkhus, those beings who are bound by touch are thoroughly bound.”
