“Bhikkhus, when release of mind by |loving-kindness::goodwill, friendliness, benevolence [mettā]| is practiced, |cultivated::developed [bhāvita]|, practiced often, made a vehicle, made a basis, firmly established, nurtured, and |resolutely undertaken::fully engaged with, energetically taken up [susamāraddha]|, eleven benefits can be expected.

Which eleven?

1. One sleeps with ease,

2. One wakes up with ease,

3. One does not see evil dreams,

4. One is dear to human beings,

5. One is dear to non-human beings,

6. Deities protect one,

7. Fire, poison, and weapons cannot harm one,

8. One’s mind becomes collected quickly,

9. One’s facial complexion becomes clear,

10. One dies unconfused, and

11. If one does not penetrate further, one goes to the Brahma world.

Bhikkhus, when release of mind by loving-kindness is practiced, cultivated, practiced often, made a vehicle, made a basis, firmly established, nurtured, and resolutely undertaken, these eleven benefits can be expected.”
