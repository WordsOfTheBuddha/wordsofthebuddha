“Bhikkhus, |diligence::quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]| should be practiced in four areas. What four?

1 Abandon |bodily misconduct::killing living beings, harming others, theft, or sexual misconduct [kāyaduccarita]| and develop good bodily conduct; do not be |negligent::inattentive, careless, intoxicated [pamāda]| in this.

2 Abandon |verbal misconduct::false speech, harsh speech, divisive speech, idle chatter [vacīduccarita]| and develop good verbal conduct; do not be negligent in this.

3 Abandon |mental misconduct::yearning with strong eagerness and desire, having ill will or hatred, delighting in harm [manoduccarita]| and develop good mental conduct; do not be negligent in this.

4 Abandon |wrong view::distorted perceptions, untrue views, false beliefs [micchādiṭṭhi]| and develop |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|; do not be negligent in this.

Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has abandoned wrong bodily conduct and cultivated good bodily conduct, abandoned wrong verbal conduct and cultivated good verbal conduct, abandoned wrong mental conduct and cultivated good mental conduct, abandoned wrong view and cultivated right view, he need not fear death or what comes after death.”
