“Bhikkhus, without |giving up::letting go, abandoning, removing [pahāna]| these five things, one is incapable of entering and abiding in the first jhāna. What are the five?

1.) |Stinginess::selfishness, meanness, tight-fistedness [macchariya]| regarding |dwelling place::residence, home [āvāsa]|, 2) stinginess regarding supporting families, 3) stinginess regarding |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābha]|, 4) stinginess regarding |praise::approval [vaṇṇa]|, and 5) stinginess regarding the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|. These, bhikkhus, are the five things that, without giving up, one is incapable of entering and abiding in the first jhāna.

Bhikkhus, by giving up these five things, one is capable of entering and abiding in the first jhāna. What are the five?

1.) Stinginess regarding dwelling place, 2) stinginess regarding supporting families, 3) stinginess regarding acquisitions, 4) stinginess regarding praise, and 5) stinginess regarding the Dhamma.
