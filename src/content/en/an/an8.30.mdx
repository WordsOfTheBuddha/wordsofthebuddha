At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the |Bhaggans::name of the people of Bhagga [bhaggā]| in |Crocodile Mountain::name of the capital city of Bhagga [susumāragira]|, in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Grove. Now at that time, the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling among the |Cetīs::name of the people from Ceta [cetī]|, in the Eastern Bamboo park. Then, while the venerable Anuruddha was alone in seclusion, the following thought arose in his mind:

“1) This |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| is for one |with few desires::having few needs, who is modest [appiccha]|, not for one |full of desires::with longing and yearning for many things, greediness [mahiccha]|;
2) This Dhamma is for one who is |content::satisfied, pleased [santuṭṭha]|, not for one who is |discontent::displeased, unhappy [asantuṭṭha]|;
3) This Dhamma is for one who is |secluded::detached, solitary [pavivitta]|, not for one who |delights in company::takes pleasure in association [saṅgaṇikārāma]|;
4) This Dhamma is for one |with energy aroused::with initiative [āraddhavīriya]|, not for one |with laziness::procrastinating, inactive, indolently [kusīta]|;
5) This Dhamma is for one who |attends mindfully::is with presence of mind [upaṭṭhitassatī]|, not for one who is |muddle-minded::forgetful, not mindful [muṭṭhassatī]|;
6) This Dhamma is for one who is |collected::composed, settled [samāhita]|, not for one who is |distracted::with scattered attention, not collected, not well-composed [asamāhita]|;
7) This Dhamma is for one who is |wise::intelligent, discerning, insightful, percipient [paññava]|, not for one who is |undiscerning::without wisdom [duppañña]|.”

Then the Blessed One, having known with his own mind the train of thought in the Venerable Anuruddha’s mind—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm, or bend his extended arm—disappeared from the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Grove in Crocodile Mountain among the Bhaggans and reappeared in the Eastern Bamboo Park among the Cetīs, right in front of the Venerable Anuruddha. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. The Venerable Anuruddha, having paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side. As he sat there, the Blessed One said this to the Venerable Anuruddha:

“Good, good, Anuruddha! It is good that you think these thoughts of a great person, namely: ‘This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one full of desires; this Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent; this Dhamma is for one who is secluded, not for one who delights in company; this Dhamma is for one with energy aroused, not for one with laziness; this Dhamma is for one who attends mindfully, not for one who is muddle-minded; this Dhamma is for one who is collected, not for one who is distracted; this Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is undiscerning.’ Therefore, Anuruddha, you should also think this eighth thought of a great person: ‘This Dhamma is for one who delights in |non-proliferation::not forming various opinions [nippapañca]|, who finds joy in non-proliferation, not for one who delights in |mental proliferation::various opinions, endless conceptualization [papañca]|, who takes pleasure in mental proliferation.’

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, then, whenever you wish, secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, you will enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and is |imbued with joyful pleasure::imbued with joy and happiness, with delight and ease, sometimes experienced as an intense joy or pleasure, rapture [pītisukha]|.

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, then, whenever you wish, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, you will enter and dwell in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with joyful pleasure.

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, then, whenever you wish, with the fading away of joyful pleasure, you will dwell |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, equanimous, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |ease::comfort, contentedness, happiness, pleasure [sukha]| with the body. You will enter and dwell in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, then, whenever you wish, with the abandoning of ease and |discontentment::discomfort, unpleasantness, something unsatisfactory, stress [dukkha]|, and with the settling down of |joy and sorrow::craving and aversion, pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, gladness and dejection, positive state of mind and negative state of mind [somanassadomanassa]|, you will enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant.

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, and you become one who obtains at will, without difficulty or trouble, these four jhānas that pertain to the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, then, while you dwell contentedly, your rag-robe will seem to you as a chest full of variously colored garments seems to a householder or a householder’s son; and it will serve for your delight, |non-agitation::being unperturbed, non-excitement [aparitassa]|, ease, and for entering upon |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, and you become one who obtains at will, without difficulty or trouble, these four jhānas that pertain to the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, then, while you dwell contentedly, your alms-food will seem to you as a dish of fine rice cleaned of black specks, served with various sauces and curries seems to a householder or a householder’s son; and it will serve for your delight, non-agitation, ease, and for entering upon Nibbāna.

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, and you become one who obtains at will, without difficulty or trouble, these four jhānas that pertain to the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, then, while you dwell contentedly, your dwelling place at the foot of a tree will seem to you as a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with bolts fastened and shutters closed seems to a householder or a householder’s son; and it will serve for your delight, non-agitation, ease, and for entering upon Nibbāna.

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, and you become one who obtains at will, without difficulty or trouble, these four jhānas that pertain to the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, then, while you dwell contentedly, your bed made of grass spread on the ground will seem to you as a couch spread with rugs with long fleece, patterned counterpanes, white wool covers, coverings embroidered with flowers, spread with choice antelope hides, with canopies above and red cushions at both ends seems to a householder or a householder’s son; and it will serve for your delight, non-agitation, ease, and for entering upon Nibbāna.

When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, Anuruddha, and you become one who obtains at will, without difficulty or without trouble, these four jhānas that pertain to the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life, then, while you dwell contentedly, your medicine of fermented cow’s urine will seem to you as various medicaments of ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses seem to a householder or a householder’s son; and it will serve for your delight, non-agitation, ease, and for entering upon Nibbāna. Therefore, Anuruddha, you should spend the upcoming rains retreat right here among the Cetīs, in the Eastern Bamboo Park.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Anuruddha replied to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One, having instructed the Venerable Anuruddha with this exhortation—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm, or bend his extended arm—vanished from the Eastern Bamboo Park among the Cetīs and reappeared in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Grove in Crocodile Mountain among the Bhaggans. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great person. Listen to this ... [and pay close attention, I will speak.]

And what, bhikkhus, are the eight thoughts of a great person?

1) This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one full of desires;
2) This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent;
3) This Dhamma is for one who is secluded, not for one who delights in company;
4) This Dhamma is for one with energy aroused, not for one with laziness;
5) This Dhamma is for one who attends mindfully, not for one who is muddle-minded;
6) This Dhamma is for one who is collected, not for one who is distracted;
7) This Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is undiscerning;
8) This Dhamma is for one who delights in non-proliferation, who finds joy in non-proliferation, not for one who delights in mental proliferation, who takes pleasure in proliferation.

1) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one full of desires,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhus is one with few desires, he does not wish: ‘May people know me to be one with few desires.’ Being content, he does not wish: ‘May people know me as being content.’ When he resorts to seclusion, he does not wish: ‘May people know me as one who resorts to seclusion.’ When he is energetic, he does not wish: ‘May people know me as one with aroused energy.’ Attending mindfully, he does not wish: ‘May people know me as one who attends mindfully.’ Being collected, he does not wish: ‘May people know me as one who is collected.’ Being wise, he does not wish: ‘May people know me as wise.’ Delighting in non-proliferation, he does not wish: ‘May people know me as one who delights in non-proliferation.’ When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one full of desires,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.

2) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is content with any kind of robe, alms-food, lodging, and medicinal requisites for curing the sick. When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.

3) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is secluded, not for one who delights in company,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu is dwelling secluded, bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay followers, female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, heads of other sects, and disciples belonging to other sects approach him. In each case, with a mind that slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion, withdrawn, enjoying |renunciation::going out state, rejection of sensual pleasure [nekkhamma]|, he gives them a talk invariably concerned with dismissing them. When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is secluded, not for one who delights in company,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.

4) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one with energy aroused, not for one with laziness,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells with energy aroused for the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not shirking the responsibility of cultivating wholesome qualities. When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one with energy aroused, not for one with laziness,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.

5) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who attends mindfully, not for one who is muddle-minded,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is mindful, possessing supreme mindfulness and alertness, one who remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago. When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who attends mindfully, not for one who is muddle-minded,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.

6) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is collected, not for one who is distracted,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensual pleasures… [and so on] … enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna. When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is collected, not for one who is distracted,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.

7) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is undiscerning,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is endowed with wisdom that discerns the |arising and passing away::appearance and disappearance, formation and dissolution [udayatthagāmī]|, which is noble and penetrative, |leading to the complete ending of suffering::leading to extinction of stress, leading to gradual and complete wearing away of discontentment [dukkhakkhayagāmī]|. When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who is wise, not for one who is undiscerning,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.

8) When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who delights in non-proliferation, who finds joy in non-proliferation, not for one who delights in proliferation, who takes pleasure in proliferation,’ with reference to what was this said? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu’s mind leaps into, gains confident, settles down, and is released in the ending of mental proliferation. When this was said: ‘This Dhamma is for one who delights in non-proliferation, who finds joy in non-proliferation, not for one who delights in proliferation, who takes pleasure in proliferation,’ it was in reference to this that this was said.”

Then the Venerable Anuruddha spent the upcoming rains retreat right there among the Cetīs, in the Eastern Bamboo Park. Then the Venerable Anuruddha, dwelling alone, secluded, |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|, with continuous effort, and resolute, in no long time realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the |perfection of the spiritual life::ideal of the spiritual path, culmination of the spiritual life [brahmacariyapariyosāna]|, for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it, he dwelled in it.

He directly knew: “Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.” And the venerable Anuruddha became one of the Arahants. Then the Venerable Anuruddha, having attained arahantship, spoke these verses at that time:

“Knowing my thoughts,
the unsurpassed teacher in the world;
Came to me through |psychic potency::supernormal ability [iddhi]|,
in a mind-made body.

He taught me more,
than my thoughts contained;
The Buddha, delighting in non-proliferation,
instructed me in non-proliferation.

Having comprehended the Dhamma,
I dwelled delighting in his teaching;
The three true knowledges have been attained,
The Buddha’s instruction has been carried out.”
