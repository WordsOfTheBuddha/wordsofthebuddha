“Bhikkhus, considering these five future perils, it is fitting for a forest-dwelling bhikkhu to dwell |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|, |resolute::determined, intent [pahitatta]|, and |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]| for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the |personal realization::intimate experience [sacchikiriyā]| of the as-yet-unrealized. What five?

1.) Here, bhikkhus, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu reflects thus: ‘I am now dwelling alone in the forest. While I am dwelling alone in the forest, a snake might bite me, a scorpion might sting me, or a centipede might sting me. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.’ This, bhikkhus, is the first future peril, considering which, it is fitting for a forest-dwelling bhikkhu to dwell diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

2.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu reflects thus: ‘I am now dwelling alone in the forest. While I am dwelling alone in the forest, I might trip and fall down, or the food I have eaten might turn out to be harmful, or my bile might flare up, or my phlegm might become disturbed, or piercing winds might flare up in me. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.’ This, bhikkhus, is the second future peril, considering which, it is fitting for a forest-dwelling bhikkhu to dwell diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

3.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu reflects thus: ‘I am now dwelling alone in the forest. While I am dwelling alone in the forest, I might encounter wild beasts—a lion, a tiger, a leopard, a bear, or a hyena—and they might take my life. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.’ This, bhikkhus, is the third future peril, considering which, it is fitting for a forest-dwelling bhikkhu to dwell diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

4.) Furthermore, bhikkhus, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu reflects thus: ‘I am now dwelling alone in the forest. While I am dwelling alone in the forest, I might encounter young men—criminals or non-criminals—and they might take my life. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.’ This, bhikkhus, is the fourth future peril, considering which, it is fitting for a forest-dwelling bhikkhu to dwell diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

5.) I am now dwelling alone in the forest. But there are savage non-human beings in the forest, and they might take my life. Because of that I might die, which would be an obstacle for me. Let me now arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.’ This, bhikkhus, is the fifth future peril, considering which, it is fitting for a forest-dwelling bhikkhu to dwell diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.

These, bhikkhus, are the five future perils, considering which, it is fitting for a forest-dwelling bhikkhu to dwell diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, and for the personal realization of the as-yet-unrealized.”
