There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus.”

“Friend,” the bhikkhus replied to the venerable Sāriputta. The venerable Sāriputta said this:

### Delighting in Personal Existence

“Friends, a bhikkhu |passes his time::dwells [viharati]| in such a way that he does not have an |auspicious::fine, excellent [bhaddaka]| death. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he does not have an auspicious death?

1.) Here, friends, a bhikkhu |takes pleasure in work::enjoys activity/work [kammārāma]|, indulges in work, and is habitually devoted to work.

2.) He takes pleasure in talk, indulges in talk, and is habitually devoted to talk.

3.) He takes pleasure in sleep, indulges in sleep, and is habitually devoted to sleep.

4.) He |takes pleasure in company::enjoys association [saṅgaṇikārāma]|, indulges in company, and is habitually devoted to company.

5.) He |takes pleasure in bonding::enjoys mingling and mixing [saṃsaggārāma]|, indulges in bonding, and is habitually devoted to bonding.

6.) He |takes pleasure in mental proliferation::enjoys manifold ideas, various opinions, takes pleasure in conceptualization [papañcārāma]|, indulges in mental proliferation, and is habitually devoted to mental proliferation.

Friends, when a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way, he does not have an auspicious death. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in |personal existence::individual identity, embodied being, view that one is the owner of the body and mind [sakkāya]|, who has not given up personal existence to completely make an end of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.

### Giving up Personal Existence

Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way that he has an auspicious death. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he has an auspicious death?

1.) Here, friends, a bhikkhu does not take pleasure in work, does not indulge in work, and is not habitually devoted to work.

2.) He does not take pleasure in talk, does not indulge in talk, and is not habitually devoted to talk.

3.) He does not take pleasure in sleep, does not indulge in sleep, and is not habitually devoted to sleep.

4.) He does not take pleasure in company, does not indulge in company, and is not habitually devoted to company.

5.) He does not take pleasure in bonding, does not indulge in bonding, and is not habitually devoted to bonding.

6.) He does not take pleasure in mental proliferation, does not indulge in mental proliferation, and is not habitually devoted to mental proliferation.

When a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way, he has an auspicious death. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|, who has given up personal existence to completely make an end of suffering.

### Verse

Whoever is engaged in mental proliferation,
who takes pleasure in mental proliferation;
Fails to attain Nibbāna,
the unsurpassed security from bondage.

But whoever, having abandoned mental proliferation,
takes pleasure in the state free from mental proliferation;
He attains Nibbāna,
the unsurpassed security from bondage.
