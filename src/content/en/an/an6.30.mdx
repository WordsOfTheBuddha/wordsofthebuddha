"Bhikkhus, these are the six unsurpassable things. What six? The unsurpassable in seeing, the unsurpassable in listening, the unsurpassable in acquisitions, the unsurpassable in training, the unsurpassable in service, and the unsurpassable in recollection.

1 And what, bhikkhus, is the \{unsurpassable in seeing} (the highest in sights [dassanānuttariya])? Here, bhikkhus, someone goes to see an elephant treasure, goes to see a horse treasure, goes to see a precious gem, or goes to see diverse sights; or else they go to see an ascetic or a brahmin who has wrong view, and who is practicing wrongly. There is this seeing—I do not deny it. But this kind of seeing is inferior, common, coarse, ignoble, and not connected with true benefit; it does not lead to disenchantment (de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]), to the \{fading of desire} (dispassion, detachment [virāga]), to \{gradual ending} (cessation, termination [nirodha]), to tranquility (calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]), to \{direct knowing} (experiential understanding [abhiññāya]), to \{full awakening} (perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]), to Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]). However, when one \{with settled faith} (with confidence in, having conviction [niviṭṭhasaddha]), \{grounded in affection} (established in fondness, dearness [niviṭṭhapema]), and \{full of confidence} (with total faith [abhippasanna]) goes to see the Tathāgata (one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of the Buddha [tathāgata]) or a disciple of the Tathāgata, this, bhikkhus, is the unsurpassable in seeing. This kind of seeing leads to the purification of beings, to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, to the subsiding of \{discomfort and distress} (physical pain and mental suffering [dukkhadomanassa]), to the attainment of the true path, and to the realization of Nibbāna. This, bhikkhus, is called the unsurpassable in seeing. Such is the unsurpassed sight.

2 And what is the \{unsurpassable in hearing} (the highest in hearing [savanānuttariya])? Here, bhikkhus, someone goes to hear the sound of a drum, goes to hear the sound of a lute, goes to hear the sound of singing, or goes to hear diverse sounds; or else they go to hear the teachings of an ascetic or a brahmin who has wrong view, and who is practicing wrongly. There is this hearing—I do not deny it. But this kind of hearing is inferior, common, coarse, ignoble, and not connected with true benefit; it does not lead to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowing, to full awakening, to Nibbāna. However, when one with settled faith, grounded in affection, and full of confidence goes to hear the Dhamma from the Tathāgata, or from a disciple of the Tathāgata, this, bhikkhus, is the unsurpassable in hearing. This kind of hearing leads to the purification of beings, to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, to the subsiding of discomfort and distress, to the attainment of the true path, and to the realization of Nibbāna. This, bhikkhus, is called the unsurpassable in hearing. Such is the unsurpassed sight and the unsurpassed hearing.

3 And what is the \{unsurpassable in acquisitions} (the highest in gains [lābhānuttariya])? Here, bhikkhus, someone obtains a child, obtains a partner, acquires riches, or obtains various kinds of acquisitions; or else they acquire faith in an ascetic or a brahmin who has wrong view, and who is practicing wrongly. There is this acquisition—I do not deny it. But this kind of acquisition is inferior, common, coarse, ignoble, and not connected with true benefit; it does not lead to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowing, to full awakening, to Nibbāna. However, when one with settled faith, grounded in affection, and full of confidence acquires faith in the Tathāgata, or in a disciple of the Tathāgata, this, bhikkhus, is the unsurpassable in acquisitions. This kind of acquisition leads to the purification of beings, to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, to the subsiding of discomfort and distress, to the attainment of the true path, and to the realization of Nibbāna. This, bhikkhus, is called the unsurpassable in acquisitions. Such is the unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, and the unsurpassed acquisition.

4 And what is the \{unsurpassable in training} (the highest in learning or training [sikkhānuttariya])? Here, bhikkhus, someone trains in elephant-riding, trains in horse-riding, trains in charioteering, trains in archery, trains in swordsmanship, or trains in various skills; or else they train under an ascetic or a brahmin who has wrong view, and who is practicing wrongly. There is this training—I do not deny it. But this kind of training is inferior, common, coarse, ignoble, and not connected with true benefit; it does not lead to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowing, to full awakening, to Nibbāna. However, when one with settled faith, grounded in affection, and full of confidence trains in the \{higher virtue} (higher conduct [adhisīla]), the \{higher mind} (meditation, mental development, higher consciousness, [adhicitta]), and the \{deeper understanding} (higher wisdom, insight [adhipaññā]) in the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]) and Discipline (code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]) declared by the Tathāgata, this, bhikkhus, is the unsurpassable in training. This kind of training leads to the purification of beings, to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, to the subsiding of discomfort and distress, to the attainment of the true path, and to the realization of Nibbāna. This, bhikkhus, is called the unsurpassable in training. Such is the unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, the unsurpassed acquisition, and the unsurpassed training.

5 And what is the \{unsurpassable in service} (the highest in offering service or attendance [pāricariyānuttariya])? Here, bhikkhus, someone serves a noble warrior, serves a brahmin, serves a householder, or they serve various others; or else they serve an ascetic or a brahmin who has wrong view, and who is practicing wrongly. There is this service—I do not deny it. But this kind of service is inferior, common, coarse, ignoble, and not connected with true benefit; it does not lead to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowing, to full awakening, to Nibbāna. However, when one with settled faith, grounded in affection, and full of confidence serves the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata, this, bhikkhus, is the unsurpassable in service. This kind of service leads to the purification of beings, to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, to the subsiding of discomfort and distress, to the attainment of the true path, and to the realization of Nibbāna. This, bhikkhus, is called the unsurpassable in service. Such is the unsurpassed sight, the unsurpassed hearing, the unsurpassed acquisition, the unsurpassed training, and the unsurpassed service.

6 And what is the \{unsurpassable in recollection} (the highest in reflections [anussatānuttariya])? Here, bhikkhus, someone recollects the obtaining of a child, recollects the obtaining of a partner, recollects the acquiring of riches, or recollects various kinds of acquisitions; or else they recollect an ascetic or a brahmin who has wrong view, and who is practicing wrongly. There is this recollection—I do not deny it. But this kind of recollection is inferior, common, coarse, ignoble, and not connected with true benefit; it does not lead to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowing, to full awakening, to Nibbāna. However, when one with settled faith, grounded in affection, and full of confidence recollects the Tathāgata or on a disciple of the Tathāgata, this, bhikkhus, is the unsurpassable in recollection. This kind of recollection leads to the purification of beings, to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, to the subsiding of discomfort and distress, to the attainment of the true path, and to the realization of Nibbāna. This, bhikkhus, is called the unsurpassable in recollection.

These, bhikkhus, are the six unsurpassable things."

### Verse

"Having gained the best of sights,
and the unsurpassable in hearing;
Having acquired the unsurpassed acquisition,
and \{delighting in} (devoted to [rata]) the unsurpassed training.

Devoted to service,
one cultivates recollection;
Connected with seclusion,
secure, leading to the deathless (deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amata]).

Rejoicing in diligence (quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]),
discerning (astute, wise [nipaka]), restrained by virtue;
Indeed, they reach in due time,
the place where suffering ceases (finishes, vanishes [nirujjhati])."
