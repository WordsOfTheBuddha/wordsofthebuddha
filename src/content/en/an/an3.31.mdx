“Bhikkhus, those families are said to dwell with Brahmā where at home the children honor their mother and father. Bhikkhus, those families are said to dwell with first teachers where at home the children honor their mother and father. Bhikkhus, those families are said to dwell with those worthy of offerings where at home, the children honor their mother and father.

Bhikkhus, 'Brahmā' is a designation for mother and father.

'First teachers' is a designation for mother and father.

'Worthy of offerings' is a designation for mother and father.

Why is that? Bhikkhus, mother and father are of great help to their children, for they are protectors, nurturers, and guides of this world.

Mother and father are said to be ‘Brahmā,’
they are called ‘first teachers;’
They are also called worthy of offerings,
for they're concerned for their children.

Therefore, one should honor them,
and a wise person should respect them;
With food and drink,
with clothing and bedding;
By massaging and by bathing,
and by washing their feet.

Because of such service,
towards one's mother and father;
Right here, wise people praise him,
and after death, he rejoices in heaven.”
