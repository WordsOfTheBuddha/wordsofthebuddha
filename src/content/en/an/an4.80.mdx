At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi, in Ghosita’s park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Venerable Ānanda addressed the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, what is the cause, what is the condition, whereby a |woman::female, womankind [mātugama]| neither sits in an assembly, nor engages in work, nor journeys to |Kamboja::an ancient kingdom in the area that is now northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan [kamboja]|?”

“A woman is |irritable::prone to anger [kodhana]|, Ānanda; a woman is |envious::jealous, covetous [issukī]|, Ānanda; a woman is |miserly::stingy, greedy [maccharī]|, Ānanda; a woman is |undiscerning::without wisdom [duppañña]|, Ānanda. This, Ānanda, is the cause and condition for why a woman neither sits in public assemblies, nor engages in work, nor journeys to Kamboja.”
