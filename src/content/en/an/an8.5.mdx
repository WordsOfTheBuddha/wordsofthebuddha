"Bhikkhus, there are these eight worldly conditions that revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight? Gain (acquisition, money, profit, possessions [lābha]) and loss (not getting, not obtaining, not finding [alābha]), fame (glory, prestige [yasa]) and disgrace (loss of reputation, infamy [ayasa]), blame (criticism, disapproval [nindā]) and praise (commendation, approval [pasaṃsā]), and pleasure (ease, comfort, happiness, contentment [sukha]) and pain (unease, discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment [dukkha]). These, bhikkhus, are the eight worldly conditions that revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.

Gain and loss, fame and disgrace,
blame and praise, and pleasure and pain;
These conditions among humans are impermanent (not lasting, transient, unreliable [anicca]),
unstable (perishable [asassata]) and subject to change.

A mindful (who has recollection, is aware, present [satimant]) and discerning (wise [sumedha]) person, having understood these conditions, 
sees them as being subject to change;
Favorable (pleasing, likeable, cherished [iṭṭha]) conditions do not stir (agitate, disturb, or excite [matheti]) their mind,
and unfavorable conditions cause no repulsion (resistance [paṭighātameti]).

They have dispelled alignment (favor [anurodha]) and opposition (aversion, resistance, hostility [virodha]),
these are gone and no longer present;
Having understood the unblemished (pure, stainless [viraja]), sorrowless state,
they comprehend rightly, having crossed beyond becoming (state of existence, rebirth [bhava])."
