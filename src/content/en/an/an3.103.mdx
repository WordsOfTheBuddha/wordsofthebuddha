“Before my full awakening, when I was still a |Bodhisatta::Buddha before his awakening, aspirant Buddha [bodhisatta]|, it occurred to me: ‘What is the |gratification::satisfaction, pleasure, enjoyment, sweetness [assāda]| in the world? What is the |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| in it? And what is the |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| from it?

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘Whatever |happiness::contentment, ease, pleasant abiding [sukha]| and |pleasure::gladness, joy, positive state of mind [somanassa]| arise dependent on the world — this is the gratification in the world.

Whatever is |impermanent::not lasting, transient, unreliable [anicca]|, |dissatisfactory::uncomfortable, unpleasant [dukkha]|, and |subject to change::of the nature of alteration, decay [vipariṇāmadhamma]| — this is the drawback in the world.

The removal of |desire and attachment::desire-passion, sensual craving, intention of sensuality and lust [chandarāga]|, the abandoning of desire and attachment — this is the escape from the world.’

Bhikkhus, as long as I did not |experientially understand::directly knew, realized [abbhaññāsi]|, |as they truly are::as they have come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|, the gratification in the world as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening in this world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion; lit. causing death [mārake]|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners.

But bhikkhus, when I experientially understood, as they truly are, the gratification in the world as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape, only then did I claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening in this world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners.

|Insight::understanding, knowing [ñāṇa]| and |vision::realization [dassana]| arose in me: ‘My liberation is unshakeable, this is my final birth, now there is no more |renewed existence::renewal of being, reappearance, rebirth, future life [punabbhava]|.’"
