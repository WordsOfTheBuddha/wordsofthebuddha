Bhikkhus, for a person with wrong view, his wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong collectedness, wrong wisdom, and false liberation, as well as any bodily actions undertaken in accordance with his view, any verbal actions, any mental actions undertaken in accordance with his view, all intentions, desires, aspirations, and formations, all those phenomena lead to what is undesirable, unwanted, unpleasant, unbeneficial, and suffering. What is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, his view is corrupted.

Just as, bhikkhus, if a neem seed, a bitter gourd seed, or a bitter cucumber seed is planted in moist soil, whatever nutrients it absorbs from the soil and water, all of that will result in bitterness, acridness, and unpleasantness. What is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, the seed is corrupted. Similarly, bhikkhus, for a person with wrong view, his wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong collectedness, wrong wisdom, and false liberation, as well as any bodily actions undertaken in accordance with his view, any verbal actions, any mental actions undertaken in accordance with his view, all intentions, desires, aspirations, and formations, all those phenomena lead to what is undesirable, unwanted, unpleasant, unbeneficial, and suffering. What is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, his view is corrupted.

Bhikkhus, for a person with right view, his right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness, right wisdom, and right liberation, as well as any bodily actions undertaken in accordance with his view, any verbal actions, any mental actions undertaken in accordance with his view, all intentions, desires, aspirations, and formations, all those phenomena lead to what is desirable, wanted, pleasant, beneficial, and happiness. What is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, his view is good.

Just as, bhikkhus, if a sugarcane seed, a rice seed, or a grape seed is planted in moist soil, whatever nutrients it absorbs from the soil and water, all of that will result in sweetness, pleasantness, and tastiness. What is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, the seed is good. Similarly, bhikkhus, for a person with right view, his right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness, right wisdom, and true liberation, as well as any bodily actions undertaken in accordance with his view, any verbal actions, any mental actions undertaken in accordance with his view, all intentions, desires, aspirations, and formations, all those phenomena lead to what is desirable, wanted, pleasant, beneficial, and happiness. What is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, his view is good.”
