#### Lacking Proximate Cause

“1. For |an unprincipled person::one without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]|, bhikkhus, |for one deficient in virtuous conduct::who has transgressed the moral precepts [sīlavipanna]|, |non-regret::not experiencing remorse [avippaṭisāra]| lacks its proximate cause.

2. When there is no non-regret, for one without non-regret, |joy::happiness, gladness [pāmojja]| lacks its proximate cause.

3. When there is no joy, for one without joy, |joyful pleasure::heartfelt or intense joy, feeling of love, rapture lit. lovely feeling [pīti]| lacks its proximate cause.

4. When there is no joyful pleasure, for one without joyful pleasure, |tranquility::peace, serenity, stillness [passaddhi]| lacks its proximate cause.

5. When there is no tranquility, for one without tranquility, |ease::contentment, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]| lacks its proximate cause.

6. When there is no ease, for one without ease, |right collectedness::perfect stability of mind, correct mental composure [sammāsamādhi]| lacks its proximate cause.

7. When there is no right collectedness, for one without right collectedness, |understanding and insight into things as they truly are::knowing and seeing reality [yathābhūtañāṇadassana]| lacks its proximate cause.

8. When there is no understanding and insight into things as they truly are, for one without the understanding and insight into things as they truly are, |disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]| lacks its proximate cause.

9. Where there is no disenchantment, for one without disenchantment, |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]| lacks its proximate cause.

10. When there is no fading of desire, for one without fading of desire, 11. |knowledge and vision of liberation::understanding and realization of liberation, total understanding of emancipation [vimuttiñāṇadassana]| lacks its proximate cause.

Suppose, bhikkhus, there is a tree without branches and leaves. Then its shoots do not grow to fullness; also its bark, sapwood, and heartwood do not grow to fullness.

So too, bhikkhus, for an unprincipled person, for one deficient in virtuous conduct, non-regret lacks its proximate cause. When there is no non-regret, for one without non-regret, joy lacks its proximate cause. <collapse>When there is no joy, for one without joy, joyful pleasure lacks its proximate cause. When there is no joyful pleasure, for one without joyful pleasure, tranquility lacks its proximate cause. When there is no tranquility, for one without tranquility, ease lacks its proximate cause. When there is no ease, for one without ease, right collectedness lacks its proximate cause. When there is no right collectedness, for one without right collectedness, understanding and insight into things as they truly are lacks its proximate cause. When there is no understanding and insight into things as they truly are, for one without the understanding and insight into things as they truly are, disenchantment lacks its proximate cause. When there is no disenchantment, for one without disenchantment, fading of desire lacks its proximate cause. When there is no fading of desire, for one without fading of desire,</collapse> knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its proximate cause.
