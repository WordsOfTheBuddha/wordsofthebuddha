“Bhikkhus, in the |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]| of the Noble Ones, singing is considered |wailing::crying [ruṇṇa]|; dancing is considered |madness::insanity [ummattaka]|; and excessive laughter that bares the teeth is regarded as |childishness::immaturity, juvenile behavior [komāraka]|. Therefore, bhikkhus, let there be a severing of the bridge to singing, a severing of the bridge to dancing. For those who |delight in::take joy in [pamodita]| the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, a mere gentle smile is fitting <sup>[1]</sup>.”
