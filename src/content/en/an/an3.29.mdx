“There are, bhikkhus, these three kinds of persons who are found existing in the world. What three? The blind, the one-eyed, and the two-eyed.

And who, bhikkhus, is the blind person? Here, a certain individual does not possess the kind of vision by which they might acquire wealth not obtained yet or make acquired wealth increase. Nor do they have the kind of vision by which they could understand the |wholesome and unwholesome::what is skillful and unskillful [kusalākusala]| qualities, |blameworthy and blameless::what is objectionable and irreproachable [sāvajjānavajja]| qualities, |inferior and superior::what is coarse and refined [hīnappaṇīta]| qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This, bhikkhus, is called the blind person.

And who, bhikkhus, is the one-eyed person? Here, bhikkhus, a certain individual has the kind of vision by which they might acquire wealth not obtained yet or make acquired wealth increase; but they do not have the kind of vision by which they could understand the wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This, bhikkhus, is called the one-eyed person.

And who, bhikkhus, is the two-eyed person? Here, bhikkhus, a certain individual possesses the kind of vision by which they could acquire wealth not yet obtained, or make acquired wealth increase; and they also possess the kind of vision by which they could understand the wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This, bhikkhus, is called the two-eyed person.

These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons who are found existing in the world.

He has no suitable wealth,
nor does he perform meritorious deeds;
Failing in both respects,
he is like a blind person, with destroyed vision.

Then another is declared,
The person who is one-eyed;
By right and wrong [means], this |deceitful::dishonest, cunning [saṭha]| one,
seeks out wealth.

By theft and |fraudulence::crookedness, corruption [kūṭakamma]|,
as well as by falsehood;
He is skilled in accumulating,
that man |who indulges in sensual pleasures::who enjoys sensual gratification [kāmabhogī]|;
From here, having gone to |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|,
the one-eyed person suffers anguish.

However, the two-eyed is declared,
as the |foremost::best, most important [seṭṭha]| person;
With wealth legitimately acquired,
riches |acquired by effort::obtained by hard work [uṭṭhānādhigata]|.

The person who gives with the best intention,
|with an undistracted mind::mentally unscattered [abyaggamānasa]|;
He goes to a good place,
where, having gone, he does not |sorrow::grieve [socati]|.

The blind and the one-eyed,
one should completely avoid;
But one should associate with the two-eyed,
the foremost person.”
