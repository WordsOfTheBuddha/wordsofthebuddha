“Bhikkhus, in three cases, |vigour::effort, energy, and enthusiasm, lit. to be burned [ātappa]| should be applied. What three? 1) Vigour should be applied for the non-arising of unarisen |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental qualities. 2) Vigour should be applied for the arising of unarisen |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusalesu]| mental qualities. 3) Vigour should be applied for enduring arisen painful bodily feelings—those that are intense, harsh, sharp, disagreeable, distressing, and even life-threatening. In these three cases, bhikkhus, vigour should be applied.

Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu applies vigour for the non-arising of unarisen unwholesome mental qualities, when he applies vigour for the arising of unarisen wholesome mental qualities, when he applies vigour for enduring arisen painful bodily feelings—those that are intense, harsh, sharp, disagreeable, distressing, and even life-threatening—then, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu is said to be |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, |discerning::astute, wise [nipaka]|, and mindful, and working rightly to bring an end to |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”
