“Bhikkhus, approaching wrongness leads to failure, not success. How does this happen? For one with |wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|, |wrong intention::wrong notion, wrong idea [micchāsaṅkappa]| arises; for one with wrong intention, |wrong speech::speech that is false, divisive, harsh, or frivolous; communication rooted in deceit, hostility, or heedlessness [micchāvācā]| arises; for one with wrong speech, |wrong action::bodily conduct that causes harm—acts of killing, stealing, or sexual misconduct; behavior contrary to harmlessness and restraint [micchākammanta]| arises; for one with wrong action, |wrong livelihood::earning a living or seeking support through deceitful or manipulative means—by cheating, flattery, hinting, disparaging others, or scheming for gain [micchāājīva]| arises; for one with wrong livelihood, |wrong effort::striving that generates or maintains unwholesome states while neglecting wholesome ones [micchāvāyāma]| arises; for one with wrong effort, |wrong mindfulness::imperfect memory, misinformed recollection that reinforces delusion or distraction [micchāsati]| arises; for one with wrong mindfulness, |wrong collectedness::wrong concentration that can cause harm to oneself, destabilize the mind, or lead to furthering of delusion [micchāsamādhi]| arises; for one with wrong collectedness, |wrong knowledge::understanding based on delusion, that which fuels further confusion and doubt [micchāñāṇa]| arises; for one with wrong knowledge, |false liberation::a temporary or deluded sense of freedom where craving, passion and aversion re-appear [micchāvimutti]| arises. Thus, bhikkhus, approaching wrongness leads to failure, not success.

Conversely, bhikkhus, approaching rightness leads to success, not failure. How does this happen? For one with |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]| arises; for one with right intention, |right speech::speech that is purified by abstaining from falsehood, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]| arises; for one with right speech, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]| arises; for one with right action, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]| arises; for one with right livelihood, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]| arises; for one with right effort, |right mindfulness::perfect memory of the Dhamma; correct recollection of the exact instructions to guide one's practice [sammāsati]| arises; for one with right mindfulness, |right collectedness::correct mental composure that stabilizes the mind and supports clarity of thoughts [sammāsamādhi]| arises; for one with right collectedness, |right knowledge::perfect understanding [sammāñāṇa]| arises; for one with right knowledge, true liberation arises. Thus, bhikkhus, approaching rightness leads to success, not failure.”
