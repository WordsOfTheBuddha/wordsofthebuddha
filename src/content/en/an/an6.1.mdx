title: Paṭhamaāhuneyya sutta - Worthy of Offerings (First)
description: The Buddha explains the six qualities in relation to the six senses that makes a person worthy of offerings, hospitality, gifts, and reverence.
qualities: equanimity, mindfulness, full awareness
theme: inspiration, wisdom
slug: an6.1
commentary:
  - The equanimity here is not a matter of indifference or apathy toward an unrelated object; rather, it is the quality of mental poise that arises through the purification of mindfulness and full awareness, leading to the relinquishment of craving and aversion toward sensory experiences.
  - These six qualities are describing the constant abiding of a fully awakened being, an Arahant.

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with six qualities is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, deserving of reverence, and an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six?

Here, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees a |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| with the eye, he is neither |gladdened::filled with joy accompanied by lust in regard to a desirable object [sumana]| nor |saddened::filled with sadness accompanied by aversion in regard to an undesirable object [dumana]|; he |abides::lives, dwells, stays, remains, continues [viharati]| in a |state of equanimity::mental poised, mentally balanced, equanimous, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|.

When he hears a |sound::an auditory object such as a sound, noise, melody, or verbal expression—whether it be praise, blame, honor, affection, or disrespect—that can stir emotion, memory, or craving [sadda]| with the ear, <collapse>he is neither gladdened nor saddened; he abides in a state of equanimity, mindful and fully aware.</collapse>

When he smells an |odor::a smell or scent such as a fragrance, aroma, stench, perfume, or natural odor from a flower, food, or the earth—an olfactory experience that may trigger memory, comfort, craving, or aversion [gandha]| with the nose, <collapse>he is neither gladdened nor saddened; he abides in a state of equanimity, mindful and fully aware.</collapse>

When he tastes a |flavor::a taste or flavor such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle notes like umami or astringency—an object of gustatory experience that can become desirable, comforting, or indulgent [rasa]| with the tongue, <collapse>he is neither gladdened nor saddened; he abides in a state of equanimity, mindful and fully aware.</collapse>

When he feels a |tangible object::a tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, or pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| with the body, <collapse>he is neither gladdened nor saddened; he abides in a state of equanimity, mindful and fully aware.</collapse>

When he knows a |mental object::a mind object such as a thought, idea, memory, intention, emotion, image, or concept arising within the mind that becomes the object of awareness, reflection, craving, or aversion [dhamma]| with the mind, he is neither gladdened nor saddened; he abides in a state of equanimity, mindful and fully aware.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with these six qualities is truly worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, deserving of reverence, and an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
