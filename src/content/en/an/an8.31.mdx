“Bhikkhus, there are these eight kinds of giving. Which eight?

1) One |gives::the act of giving or donating, with an intention to give [dāna]| after |insulting::offending, disrespecting [āsajja]| [the recipient].

2) One gives out of panic.

3) One gives thinking, ‘He gave to me [in the past].’

4) One gives thinking, ‘He will give to me [in the future].’

5) One gives thinking, ‘Giving is good.’

6) One gives thinking, ‘I cook; these others do not cook. It is unfitting for me, who cooks, to deny  to those who do not cook.’

7) One gives thinking, ‘When I give this gift, a favorable reputation will spread.’

8) One gives for the sake of purifying and supporting the mind.

These, bhikkhus, are the eight kinds of giving.”
