“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, even when listening to the |good Dhamma::good teaching, true doctrine [saddhamma]|, one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course of rightness in |wholesome qualities::skillful actions, good habits [kusaladhammā]|. What six? When the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| and |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]| proclaimed by the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| is being taught: 1.) one does not wish to listen, 2.) one does not lend an ear, 3.) one does not apply the mind to understand, 4.) one grasps |what is useless::what is unbeneficial [anattha]|, 5.) one neglects what is beneficial, 6.) one has adopted a conviction that is not in conformity [with the teaching]. Possessing these six qualities, bhikkhus, even when listening to the good Dhamma, one is incapable of entering upon the fixed course of rightness in wholesome qualities.
