Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated there, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the Blessed One thus:

“1) Venerable sir, what is the cause, what is the condition, whereby for some person here a |trade::commerce, business [vaṇijjā]| of this sort, once undertaken, leads to loss? 2) And what, venerable sir, is the cause and condition, whereby for some person here a trade of this sort, once undertaken, fails to meet its intended aim? 3) And what, venerable sir, is the cause and condition, whereby for some person here a trade of this sort, once undertaken, succeeds as intended? 4) And what, venerable sir, is the cause and condition, whereby for some person here a trade of this sort, once undertaken, surpasses even its intended aim?”

“1) Here, Sāriputta, a certain person approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites them: ‘Venerable sir, please ask [to provide guidance] regarding requisites.’ Yet he does not give what was requested. If, after passing away from that state, he is reborn into this world, whatever trade he then undertakes will lead to loss.

2) But here, Sāriputta, a certain person approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites them: ‘Venerable sir, please ask [to provide guidance] regarding requisites.’ He gives it to him but not in line with expectations. If, after passing away from that state, he is reborn into this world, whatever trade he then undertakes will fail to meet its intended aim.

3) But here, Sāriputta, a certain person approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites them: ‘Venerable sir, please ask [to provide guidance] regarding requisites.’ He gives it to him in full accordance with his intention. If, after passing away from that state, he is reborn into this world, whatever trade he then undertakes will succeed as intended.

4) Here, Sāriputta, a certain person approaches an ascetic or a brahmin and invites them: ‘Venerable sir, please ask [to provide guidance] regarding requisites.’ He gives it to him in a manner exceeding expectations. If, after passing away from that state, he is reborn into this world, whatever trade he then undertakes will surpass even its intended aim.

1) This, Sāriputta, is the cause, this is the condition, whereby for a certain person here, a trade of this sort, once undertaken, leads to loss. 2) And this, Sāriputta, is the cause and condition, whereby for a certain person here, a trade of this sort, once undertaken, fails to meet its intended aim. 3) But this, Sāriputta, is the cause and condition, whereby for a certain person here, a trade of this sort, once undertaken, succeeds as intended. 4) And this, Sāriputta, is the cause and condition, whereby for a certain person here, a trade of this sort, once undertaken, surpasses even its intended aim.”
