Bhikkhus, these eight persons are worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation, and are the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. Which eight? The stream-enterer, one practicing for the realization of the fruit of stream-entry, the once-returner, one practicing for the realization of the fruit of once-returning, the non-returner, one practicing for the realization of the fruit of non-returning, the arahant, one practicing for arahantship. These, bhikkhus, are the eight persons who are worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation, and are the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.

### Verse

Four are practicing,
and four are established in their fruits;
This Saṅgha is upright,
endowed with wisdom and virtue.

For the humans offering sacrifices,
those beings seeking merit;
Performing attachment-related merit,
what is given to the Saṅgha yields great fruit.
