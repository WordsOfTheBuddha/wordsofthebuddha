“Bhikkhus, there are these four unwholesome practices. What four? 1) Valuing |anger::rage, wrath, fury, indignation [kodha]|, not valuing the |good Dhamma::good teaching, true doctrine, true nature of things, four foundations of mindfulness [saddhamma = sat + dhamma]|; 2) valuing |contempt::ungratefulness, depreciation, denigration, disrespect, belittlement, disparagement [makkha]|, not valuing the good Dhamma; 3) valuing |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābha]|, not valuing the good Dhamma; 4) valuing |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, not valuing the good Dhamma. These are the four unwholesome practices.

Bhikkhus, there are these four wholesome practices. What four? 1) Valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing anger; 2) valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing contempt; 3) valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing acquisitions; 4) valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing respect. These are the four wholesome practices.”

### Verse

Bhikkhus who value anger and contempt,
and who revere gain and honor;
Do not grow in the good Dhamma,
taught by the perfectly awakened one.

But those who value the good Dhamma,
and live in accordance with it;
They indeed grow in the good Dhamma,
taught by the perfectly awakened one.
