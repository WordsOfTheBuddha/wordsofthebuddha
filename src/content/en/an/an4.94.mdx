“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, one person gains internal tranquility of mind but does not gain insight into phenomena through higher wisdom. Here, bhikkhus, another person gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom but does not gain internal tranquility of mind. Here, bhikkhus, another person neither gains internal tranquility of mind nor gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom. And then there is a person who gains both internal tranquility of mind and gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

Therein, bhikkhus, when a person gains internal tranquility of mind but does not gain insight into phenomena through higher wisdom, he should approach the one who gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom and ask: ‘How, friend, should |formations::saṅkhārā| be regarded? How should formations be thoroughly understood? How should formations be seen with insight?' Then that person explains to him as he has seen and understood: ‘Thus, friend, formations should be regarded, thus formations should be thoroughly understood, thus formations should be seen with insight.’ In this way, in due course, that person gains both internal tranquility of mind and insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

Similarly, bhikkhus, when a person gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom but does not gain internal tranquility of mind, he should approach the one who gains internal tranquility of mind and ask: ‘How, friend, should the mind be steadied? How should the mind be calmed? How should the mind be unified? How should the mind be concentrated?' Then that person explains to him as he has seen and understood: ‘Thus, friend, the mind should be steadied, thus the mind should be calmed, thus the mind should be unified, thus the mind should be concentrated.’ In this way, in due course, that person gains both insight into phenomena through higher wisdom and internal tranquility of mind.

Similarly, bhikkhus, when a person neither gains internal tranquility of mind nor insight into phenomena through higher wisdom, he should approach the one who gains both internal tranquility of mind and insight into phenomena through higher wisdom and ask: ‘How, friend, should the mind be steadied? How should the mind be calmed? How should the mind be unified? How should the mind be concentrated? How should formations be regarded? How should formations be thoroughly understood? How should formations be seen with insight?' Then that person explains to him as he has seen and understood: ‘Thus, friend, the mind should be steadied, thus the mind should be calmed, thus the mind should be unified, thus the mind should be concentrated; thus formations should be regarded, thus formations should be thoroughly understood, thus formations should be seen with insight.’ In this way, in due course, that person gains both internal tranquility of mind and insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

Finally, bhikkhus, when a person gains both internal tranquility of mind and insight into phenomena through higher wisdom, he should, relying on those wholesome qualities, strive further for the ending of the taints.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
