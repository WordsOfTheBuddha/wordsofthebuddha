“Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the purpose of deceiving people, nor for the purpose of winning favor with people, nor for the sake of |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābha]|, respect, and popularity, nor for the thought ‘Let people know me.’ Rather, bhikkhus, this spiritual life is led |for the purpose of restraint::for the sake of self-control, following of the precepts and sense-restraint [saṃvaratthaṃ]|, |for the purpose of letting go::for the sake of giving up [pahānattha]|, |for the purpose of dispassion::for the sake of detachment [virāgattha]|, and |for the purpose of cessation::for the sake of ending [nirodhatthaṃ]|.

For the purpose of restraint, for the purpose of letting go,
the spiritual life is not |based on tradition::a legend, hearsay, mere talk [itiha]|;
The Blessed One taught the spiritual life,
leading to and grounded upon |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|;
This is the path followed by the illustrious ones,
traveled by the great sages.

Whoever practices it,
as taught by the Buddha;
will make an end to suffering,
fulfilling the teacher’s instruction.”
