title: Dutiyanidāna sutta - Cause (Second)
description: What gives rise to kamma? The Buddha explains that the roots of kamma lie in how one relates to the past, future, and present. Through repeated reflections and mental re-examination, desire springs up and binds one to objects of attachment. But when one sees the consequences of those things clearly, one instead turns away from them, leading to kamma arising from complete penetration and wisdom.

“Bhikkhus, there are these three causes for the |arising::appearance, origination [samudaya]| of |kamma::action, deed, doing, volitional act [kamma]|. What three?

1) Bhikkhus, |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]| arises with reference to things gone past that are the basis for |desire and attachment::desire-passion, sensual craving, intention of sensuality and lust [chandarāga]|. 2) Desire arises with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment. 3) Desire arises with reference to things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment.

1) And how, bhikkhus, does desire arise with reference to things gone past that are the basis for desire and attachment? One |ponders over::reflects on, rethinks [anuvitakketi]| and mentally |re-examines::relooks at [anuvicāreti]| things gone past that are the basis for desire and attachment. As one does so, desire arises. When desire springs up, one is fettered by those things. Bhikkhus, I refer to |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [sārāga]| in the mind as the fetter. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that desire arises with reference to things gone past that are the basis for desire and attachment.

2) And how, bhikkhus, does desire arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment? One ponders over and mentally re-examines things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment. As one does so, desire arises. When desire springs up, one is fettered by those things. Bhikkhus, I refer to passion in the mind as the fetter. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that desire arises with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment.

3) And how, bhikkhus, does desire arise with reference to things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment? One ponders over and mentally re-examines things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment. As one does so, desire arises. When desire springs up, one is fettered by those things. Bhikkhus, I refer to passion in the mind as the fetter. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that desire arises with reference to things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment. These, bhikkhus, are the three causes for the arising of kamma.

Bhikkhus, there are these three [other] causes for the arising of kamma. What three? 1) Desire does not arise with reference to things gone past that are the basis for desire and attachment. 2) Desire does not arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment. 3) Desire does not arise with reference to things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment.

1) And how, bhikkhus, does desire not arise with reference to things gone past that are the basis for desire and attachment? One understands the |consequence::future result; lit. ripening [vipāka]| of things gone past that are the basis for desire and attachment. Having understood their consequence, one turns away from them. Having turned away, one fully penetrates them with the mind, and with |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]| sees through them completely. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that desire does not arise with reference to things gone past that are the basis for desire and attachment.

2) And how, bhikkhus, does desire not arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment? One understands the consequence of things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment. Having understood their consequence, one turns away from them. Having turned away, one fully penetrates them with the mind, and with wisdom sees through them completely. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that desire does not arise with reference to things in the future that are the basis for desire and attachment.

3) And how, bhikkhus, does desire not arise with reference to things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment? One understands the consequence of things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment. Having understood their consequence, one turns away from them. Having turned away, one fully penetrates them with the mind, and with wisdom sees through them completely. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that desire does not arise with reference to things in the present that are the basis for desire and attachment. These, bhikkhus, are the three [other] causes for the arising of kamma.”
