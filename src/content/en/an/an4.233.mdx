“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of |kamma::actions, deeds [kammā]| proclaimed by me after having realized them for myself through direct knowledge. What four?

1) There is, bhikkhus, kamma that is dark |with dark results::having negative consequences [kaṇhavipāka]|;
2) There is, bhikkhus, kamma that is bright |with bright results::having positive consequences [sukkavipāka]|;
3) There is, bhikkhus, kamma that is dark and bright |with dark and bright results::having both positive and negative consequences [kaṇhasukkavipāka]|;
4) There is, bhikkhus, kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with neither dark nor bright result, which leads to the |exhaustion of kamma::wearing away of actions [kammakkhaya]|.

And what, bhikkhus, is kamma that is dark with dark results? Here, bhikkhus, someone generates |bodily constructions::bodily processes associated with breathing, specifically the in-and-out breath. It encompasses the physical movements and sensations that arise from the act of breathing. [kāyasaṅkhāra]| that are |afflictive::hurtful, harmful [sabyābajjha]|, |verbal constructions::mental speech processes, such as internal talk, thoughts in language, or verbal intentions in the mind [vacīsaṅkhāra]| that are afflictive, and |mental constructions::mental impulses such as perception, feeling, and intention that initiate or shape mental action [cittasaṅkhāra]| that are afflictive. Having generated bodily, verbal, and mental constructions that are afflictive, he is reborn in an afflictive world. Being reborn in an afflictive world, he is affected by contacts that are afflictive. Being contacted by those afflictive contacts, he experiences afflictive feeling — exclusively painful — just like the beings living in hell. This, bhikkhus, is called kamma that is dark with dark results.

And what, bhikkhus, is kamma that is bright with bright results? Here, bhikkhus, someone generates bodily constructions that are |non-afflictive::not harmful, without suffering [abyābajjha]|, verbal constructions that are non-afflictive, and mental constructions that are non-afflictive. Having generated bodily, verbal, and mental constructions that are non-afflictive, he is reborn in a non-afflictive world. Being reborn in a non-afflictive world, he is affected by contacts that are non-afflictive. Being contacted by those non-afflictive contacts, he experiences non-afflictive feeling — exclusively pleasant — just like the |gods of Refulgent Glory::MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the third jhāna — the gods of Limited Glory and the gods of Immeasurable Glory — should be included [subhakiṇha]|.

And what, bhikkhus, is kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright results? Here, bhikkhus, someone generates bodily constructions that are both afflictive and non-afflictive, verbal constructions that are both afflictive and non-afflictive, and mental constructions that are both afflictive and non-afflictive. Having generated bodily, verbal, and mental constructions that are both afflictive and non-afflictive, he is reborn in a world that is both afflictive and non-afflictive. Being reborn in such a mixed world, he is affected by contacts that are both afflictive and non-afflictive. Being contacted by such contacts, he experiences both afflictive and non-afflictive feeling — |a mix of pleasure and pain::mingled with happiness and sorrow [vokiṇṇasukhadukkha]| — just like certain human beings, certain gods, and certain beings in the lower worlds. This, bhikkhus, is called kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright results.

And what, bhikkhus, is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result, which leads to the exhaustion of kamma? Here, bhikkhus, the |intention::will [cetanā]| involved in abandoning kamma that is dark with dark results, the intention involved in abandoning kamma that is bright with bright results, and the intention involved in abandoning kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright results — this is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result, which leads to the exhaustion of kamma.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of kamma that have been proclaimed by me after realizing them for myself through direct knowledge.”
