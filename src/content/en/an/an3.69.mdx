"Bhikkhus, there are these three unwholesome roots. What three? Greed (lust, wanting, desire [lobha]), aversion (ill-will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]), and illusion (delusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view; that which fuels not knowing of things as they have come to be [moha]).

Greed is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by greed chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame (criticism, to scold [garahā]), banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, from greed, arising due to greed, originating in greed, and conditioned by greed, many harmful (injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]), unwholesome (unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]) qualities come into being.

Aversion is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by aversion chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. And so these many bad, unwholesome things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by aversion. Thus, from aversion, arising due to aversion, originating in aversion, and conditioned by aversion, many harmful, unwholesome qualities come into being.

Illusion is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by illusion chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When a such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, from illusion, arising due to illusion, originating in illusion, and conditioned by illusion, many harmful, unwholesome qualities come into being. Such a person, bhikkhus, is also referred to as one who speaks at the wrong time, speaks falsely, speaks what is not beneficial, speaks against the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]), and speaks against discipline (code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]).

And why, bhikkhus, is such a person referred to as one who speaks at the wrong time, speaks falsely, speaks what is not beneficial, speaks against the Dhamma, and speaks against discipline? Because, bhikkhus, this person causes suffering to another through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. Moreover, when presented with what is in accordance with facts, they reject it and do not acknowledge it; when presented with falsehood, they do not make an effort to address or correct it, failing to acknowledge: 'This is untrue; this is false.' Therefore, such a person is called one who speaks at the wrong time, speaks falsely, speaks what is not beneficial, speaks against the Dhamma, and speaks against discipline.

Such a person, bhikkhus, overwhelmed and consumed by harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed, experiences suffering in the here and now, living with distress, sorrow, and regret. And with the breakup of the body, after death, they can expect a rebirth in a state of misery.

Such a person, bhikkhus, overwhelmed and consumed by harmful and unwholesome qualities born of aversion ... and illusion, experiences suffering in the here and now, living with distress, sorrow, and regret. And with the breakup of the body, after death, they can expect a rebirth in a state of misery. Bhikkhus, just as a sal tree, an axle-wood tree, or a bamboo tree, ensnared and tightly bound by three māluvā (a kind of creeper [māluvā]) creepers, succumbs to misfortune, destruction, and utter ruin—so too, bhikkhus, such a person, overwhelmed and consumed by harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed, aversion, and illusion, experiences suffering in the here and now, living with distress, sorrow, and regret. And with the breakup of the body, after death, they can expect a rebirth in a state of misery.

These are the three unwholesome roots.

There are these three wholesome roots. What three? Non-greed (absence of craving, knowing moderation [alobha]), non-aversion (kindness [adosa]), and wisdom (clear understanding, sanity, freedom from ignorance [amoha]).

Bhikkhus, non-greed is a root of the wholesome. When a person free from greed chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by greed, does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, from non-greed, arising due to non-greed, originating in non-greed, and conditioned by non-greed, many wholesome (healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]) qualities come into being.

Bhikkhus, non-aversion is a root of the wholesome. When a person free from aversion chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by aversion, does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, from non-aversion, arising due to non-aversion, originating in non-aversion, and conditioned by non-aversion, many wholesome qualities come into being.

Bhikkhus, wisdom is a root of the wholesome. When a person endowed with wisdom chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, with a mind not overcome by illusion, doesn't cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, from wisdom, arising due to wisdom, originating in wisdom, and conditioned by wisdom, many wholesome qualities come into being. Such a person, bhikkhus, is referred to as one who speaks at the right time, speaks truthfully, speaks beneficially, speaks in line with the Dhamma, and speaks in accordance with discipline.

And why, bhikkhus, is such a person referred to as one who speaks at the right time, speaks truthfully, speaks beneficially, speaks in line with the Dhamma, and speaks in accordance with discipline? Because, bhikkhus, such a person does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. Furthermore, when presented with truth, they acknowledge it and do not reject it; when presented with falsehood, they make an effort to address and correct it, recognizing: 'this is untrue, this is false.' Therefore, such a person is called one who speaks at the right time, speaks truthfully, speaks beneficially, speaks in line with the Dhamma, and speaks in accordance with discipline.

Bhikkhus, for such a person, harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and incapable of arising in the future. In this very life, they dwell happily, free from distress, sorrow, and regret. In this very life, they attain Nibbāna.

Harmful and unwholesome qualities born of aversion ... and of illusion are likewise abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and incapable of arising in the future. In this very life, they dwell happily, free from distress, sorrow, and regret. In this very life, they attain Nibbāna. Bhikkhus, it is as if a sal tree, an axle-wood tree, or a bamboo tree were ensnared and tightly bound by three māluvā creepers. Then a person comes along with a sharp axe and cuts down the creepers at their base, digs up the roots, and extracts even the tiniest root fibers, down to those as fine as reed fibers. They would cut the creepers into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers. Then they would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, and collect the ashes. Having done so, they would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. In the same way, bhikkhus, for such a person, harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and incapable of arising in the future. In this very life, they dwell happily, free from distress, sorrow, and regret. In this very life, they attain Nibbāna.

These, bhikkhus, are the three wholesome roots.
