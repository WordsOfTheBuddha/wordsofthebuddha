“Bhikkhus, there are these three unwholesome roots. What three? |Greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]|, |aversion::hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, and |delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|.

Greed is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by greed chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or |blame::criticism, to scold [garahā]|, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, from greed, arising due to greed, originating in greed, and conditioned by greed, many |harmful::injurious, bad, or evil. Encompasses the deceptively alluring that is ultimately detrimental or ruinous [pāpaka]|, |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| qualities come into being.

Aversion is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by aversion chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. And so these many bad, unwholesome things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by aversion. Thus, from aversion, arising due to aversion, originating in aversion, and conditioned by aversion, many harmful, unwholesome qualities come into being.

Delusion is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by delusion chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When a such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, from delusion, arising due to delusion, originating in delusion, and conditioned by delusion, many harmful, unwholesome qualities come into being. Such a person, bhikkhus, is also referred to as one who speaks at the wrong time, speaks falsely, speaks what is not beneficial, speaks against the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, and speaks against |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|.

And why, bhikkhus, is such a person referred to as one who speaks at the wrong time, speaks falsely, speaks what is not beneficial, speaks against the Dhamma, and speaks against the Vinaya? Because, bhikkhus, this person causes suffering to another through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. Moreover, when presented with what is in accordance with facts, they reject it and do not acknowledge it; when presented with falsehood, they do not make an effort to address or correct it, failing to acknowledge: ‘This is untrue; this is false.’ Therefore, such a person is called one who speaks at the wrong time, speaks falsely, speaks what is not beneficial, speaks against the Dhamma, and speaks against the Vinaya.

Such a person, bhikkhus, overwhelmed and consumed by harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed, experiences suffering in the here and now, living with distress, sorrow, and regret. And with the breaking up of the body, after death, they can expect a rebirth in a state of misery.

Such a person, bhikkhus, overwhelmed and consumed by harmful and unwholesome qualities born of aversion ... and delusion, experiences suffering in the here and now, living with distress, sorrow, and regret. And with the breaking up of the body, after death, they can expect a rebirth in a state of misery. Bhikkhus, just as a sal tree, an axle-wood tree, or a bamboo tree, ensnared and tightly bound by three |māluvā::a fast-growing, parasitic vine that climbs onto trees. As it grows, it tightens its grip, restricting the host tree’s growth and often strangling it to death. [māluvā]| creepers, succumbs to misfortune, destruction, and utter ruin—so too, bhikkhus, such a person, overwhelmed and consumed by harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed, aversion, and delusion, experiences suffering in the here and now, living with distress, sorrow, and regret. And with the breaking up of the body, after death, they can expect a rebirth in a state of misery.

These are the three unwholesome roots.

There are these three wholesome roots. What three? |Non-greed::the absence of greed, lack of craving or lustful wanting; contentment, renunciation [alobha]|, |non-aversion::the absence of aversion, ill will, or hostility; loving-kindness, goodwill, friendliness [adosa]|, and |non-delusion::the absence of illusion, misapprehension, or distorted view; clear comprehension, understanding things as they really are [amoha]|.

Bhikkhus, non-greed is a root of the wholesome. When a person free from greed chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by greed, does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, from non-greed, arising due to non-greed, originating in non-greed, and conditioned by non-greed, many |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| qualities come into being.

Bhikkhus, non-aversion is a root of the wholesome. When a person free from aversion chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by aversion, does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, from non-aversion, arising due to non-aversion, originating in non-aversion, and conditioned by non-aversion, many wholesome qualities come into being.

Bhikkhus, non-delusion is a root of the wholesome. When a person endowed with non-delusion chooses to act through body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, with a mind not overcome by delusion, doesn’t cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, from non-delusion, arising due to non-delusion, originating in non-delusion, and conditioned by non-delusion, many wholesome qualities come into being. Such a person, bhikkhus, is referred to as one who speaks at the right time, speaks truthfully, speaks beneficially, speaks in line with the Dhamma, and speaks in accordance with the Vinaya.

And why, bhikkhus, is such a person referred to as one who speaks at the right time, speaks truthfully, speaks beneficially, speaks in line with the Dhamma, and speaks in accordance with the Vinaya? Because, bhikkhus, such a person does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, confiscation or blame, banishing or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. Furthermore, when presented with truth, they acknowledge it and do not reject it; when presented with falsehood, they make an effort to address and correct it, recognizing: ‘this is untrue, this is false.’ Therefore, such a person is called one who speaks at the right time, speaks truthfully, speaks beneficially, speaks in line with the Dhamma, and speaks in accordance with the Vinaya.

Bhikkhus, for such a person, harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, utterly obliterated, and rendered incapable of arising in the future. In this very life, they dwell happily, free from distress, sorrow, and regret. In this very life, they attain Nibbāna.

Harmful and unwholesome qualities born of aversion ... and of delusion are likewise abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, utterly obliterated, and rendered incapable of arising in the future. In this very life, they dwell happily, free from distress, sorrow, and regret. In this very life, they attain Nibbāna. Bhikkhus, it is as if a sal tree, an axle-wood tree, or a bamboo tree were ensnared and tightly bound by three māluvā creepers. Then a person comes along with a sharp axe and cuts down the creepers at their base, digs up the roots, and extracts even the tiniest root fibers, down to those as fine as reed fibers. They would cut the creepers into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers. Then they would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, and collect the ashes. Having done so, they would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. In the same way, bhikkhus, for such a person, harmful and unwholesome qualities born of greed are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, utterly obliterated, and rendered incapable of arising in the future. In this very life, they dwell happily, free from distress, sorrow, and regret. In this very life, they attain Nibbāna.

These, bhikkhus, are the three wholesome roots.
