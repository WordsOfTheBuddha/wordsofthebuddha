"Bhikkhus, these four confidences are possessed by the Tathāgata, endowed with which, the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion. What are these four?

I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, |Brahmā::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahmā]|, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the realizations of the perfectly self-awakened one are not fully complete. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.

I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the taints are not fully eradicated in one whose taints are fully eradicated. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.

I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the things mentioned as obstructive are not sufficient to cause obstruction while one engages in them. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.

I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the realization of Dhamma does not lead to the ending of suffering for one who practices rightly. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.

These, bhikkhus, are the four confidences possessed by the Tathāgata, endowed with which, the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.

### Verse

All the diverse belief systems formulated
and relied upon by ascetics and brahmins
vanish on reaching the Tathāgata,
the self-confident one who has gone beyond belief systems.

Consummate, having fully comprehended the wheel of Dhamma,
He set it in motion out of compassion for all beings;
Beings revere such a one, the best among gods and humans,
Who has gone beyond the cycle of becoming."
