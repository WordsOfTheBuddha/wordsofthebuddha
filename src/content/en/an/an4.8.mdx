“Bhikkhus, these four |assurances::intrepedities, confidences [vesārajja]| are possessed by the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|, endowed with which, the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets the wheel of the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| in motion. What are these four?

1) I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]|, |Brahmā::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahmā]|, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the realizations of the perfectly Awakened One are not fully realized. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and self-assuredly.

2) I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the taints remain in one who is declared to be taintless. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and self-assuredly.

3) I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the things declared obstructive do not actually obstruct when engaged in. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and self-assuredly.

4) I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge the claim that the realization of Dhamma does not lead to the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]| for one who practices rightly. Not seeing such a possibility, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and self-assuredly.

These, bhikkhus, are the four assurances possessed by the Tathāgata, endowed with which, the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.

### Verse

Whatever belief systems are adhered to by the many,
and relied upon by ascetics and brahmins;
They cease to be on reaching the |Tathāgata::suchness, being in such a state [tathāgata]|,
the self-assured one who has gone beyond doctrines.

Having mastered the Dhamma, fully perfected,
who set it rolling out of compassion for all beings;
Such a one, the best among gods and humans,
is revered by beings—one gone beyond |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|.”
