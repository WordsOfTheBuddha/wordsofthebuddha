“Bhikkhus, I set out |seeking::searching, on a quest of, inquiring, in pursuit of [pariyesanā]| |gratification::satisfaction, pleasure, enjoyment, sweetness [assāda]| in the world. Whatever gratification there is in the world, I |obtained that::got that [tadajjhagamā]|. I have clearly seen with wisdom as far as gratification in the world extends. I set out seeking |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| in the world. Whatever drawback there is in the world, I found that. I have clearly seen with wisdom as far as drawback in the world extends. I set out seeking |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| from the world. Whatever escape there is in the world, I found that. I have clearly seen with wisdom as far as escape from the world extends.

Bhikkhus, as long as I did not |experientially understand::directly knew, realized [abbhaññāsi]|, |as they truly are::as they have come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|, the gratification in the world as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening in this world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion; lit. causing death [mārake]|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners.

But bhikkhus, when I experientially understood, as they truly are, the gratification in the world as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape, only then did I claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening in this world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners.

|Insight::understanding, knowing [ñāṇa]| and |vision::realization [dassana]| arose in me: ‘My liberation is unshakeable, this is my final birth, now there is no more |renewed existence::renewal of being, reappearance, rebirth, future life [punabbhava]|.’”
