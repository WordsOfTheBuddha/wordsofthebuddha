“Bhikkhus, there are eight |grounds::basis [vatthu]| for giving. What are the eight?

1. One gives a gift from |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]|,

2. One gives a gift out of |aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|,

3. One gives a gift from |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misapprehension, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|,

4. One gives a gift out of |fear::panic, scare, dread, terror [bhaya]|,

5. One gives a gift thinking, ‘My father and grandfather gave; I must not neglect the family tradition,’

6. One gives a gift thinking, ‘Having given this gift, after death, I will be reborn in a good destination, the |heavenly world::a blissful realm, celestial world [sagga]|,’

7. One gives a gift thinking, ‘As I give this gift, my mind |gains confidence:: becomes clear [pasīdati]|, and |pleasure::gladness, joy, positive state of mind [somanassa]| and joy arise,’

8. One gives a gift for the sake of purifying and supporting the mind.

These, bhikkhus, are the eight grounds for giving.”
