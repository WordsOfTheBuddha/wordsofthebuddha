“Bhikkhus, there are these four bases of a supportive relationship. What four? Giving, kind speech, beneficial action, and impartiality.

These are the four bases of a supportive relationship.

“Giving, kind speech,
beneficial action, and impartiality;
In diverse worldly conditions,
as is appropriate in each case;
These are the bases of supportive relationships in the world,
like the linchpin of a rolling chariot.

Without these bases of supportive relationships,
neither mother nor father;
would be able to obtain esteem
and veneration from their children.

But since these means of being supportive exist,
wise people respect them;
thus they experience distinction,
and are highly praised.”
