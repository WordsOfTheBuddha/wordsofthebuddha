“Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of wealth. What seven? The wealth of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|, the wealth of |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]|, the wealth of |conscience::internal sense of right and wrong used for guiding one’s behavior, moral shame, scruple [hirī]|, the wealth of |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]|, the wealth of |learning::studying, understanding, acquiring knowledge [suta]|, the wealth of |generosity::sharing, relinquishment [cāga]|, and the wealth of |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]|. These, bhikkhus, are the seven kinds of wealth.

The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtue,
The wealth of conscience and of fear of wrongdoing;
The wealth of learning and generosity,
And wisdom as the seventh wealth.

Whoever possesses these wealths,
whether a woman or a man;
is said not to be poor,
their life is truly |not in vain::fruitful [amogha]|.

Therefore, the wise should apply themselves,
to the cultivation of faith and virtue,
to clearly see the |Dhamma::the ultimate truth that the Buddha’s teachings point to [dhamma]|,
recollecting the Buddhas’ dispensation.”
