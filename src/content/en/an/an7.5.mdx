“Bhikkhus, there are these seven kinds of wealth. What seven? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtue, the wealth of conscience, the wealth of fear of wrongdoing, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom. These, bhikkhus, are the seven kinds of wealth.

The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtue,
The wealth of conscience and of fear of wrongdoing;
The wealth of learning and generosity,
And wisdom as the seventh wealth.

Whoever possesses these wealths,
whether a woman or a man;
is said not to be poor,
their life is truly |not in vain::fruitful [amogha]|.

Therefore, the wise should apply themselves,
to the cultivation of faith and virtue,
to clearly see the |Dhamma::the ultimate truth that the Buddha's teachings point to [dhamma]|,
recollecting the Buddhas’ dispensation.”
