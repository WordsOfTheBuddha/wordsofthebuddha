title: Taṇhā sutta - Craving
description: The Buddha describes craving as a pervasive net that entangles the mind. He analyzes thirty-six modes of mental stirring—eighteen internal ways of conceiving the self and eighteen external ways of identifying with the world. Expanded across time, these 108 cravings form the “tangled ball of thread” that binds beings to the cycle of rebirth.

The Blessed One said this:

“I will teach you, bhikkhus, about |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|—|entangling::lit. having a net [jālī]|, |flowing::in motion, like a river that constantly seeks new channels [sarita]|, |spreading::like a vine or a creeping plant [visaṭa]|, and |ensnaring::like a sticky substance or a hook [visattika]|—by which this world is smothered and enveloped, becoming like a tangled ball of thread, a matted bird’s nest, entwined like |Muñja grass::a tough Asiatic grass used for thatching roofs, ropes and making baskets; (comm) mental firmness and courage [muñja]| and reeds, unable to transcend the plane of misery, |bad destination::state of misery [duggati]|, |realm of downfall::realm of misery [vinipāta]|, and the cycle of existence. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus attentively listened to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then spoke:

“And what, bhikkhus, is that craving—entangling, flowing, spreading, and ensnaring—by which this world is smothered and enveloped, becoming like a tangled ball of thread, a matted bird’s nest, entwined like Muñja grass and reeds, unable to transcend the plane of misery, bad destination, realm of downfall, and the cycle of existence? There are these eighteen |mental stirrings of craving::modes or movements of craving [taṇhāvicarita]| dependent on the internal, and eighteen mental stirrings of craving dependent on the external.

What are these eighteen mental stirrings of craving dependent on the internal? When there is the notion ‘I am’ bhikkhus, there arise the notions ‘I am thus,’ ‘I am like that,’ ‘I am different,’ ‘I am everlasting,’ ‘I am impermanent.’ There arise the notions ‘I may be,’ ‘I may be thus,’ ‘I may be like that,’ ‘I may be different.’ There arise the notions ‘May I be,’ ‘May I be thus,’ ‘May I be like that,’ ‘May I be different.’ There arise the notions ‘I shall be,’ ‘I shall be thus,’ ‘I shall be like that,’ ‘I shall be different.’ These are the eighteen mental stirrings of craving dependent on the internal.

What are the eighteen mental stirrings of craving dependent on the external? When there is the notion ‘because of this, I am,’ bhikkhus, there arise such notions as: ‘Because of this, I am thus,’ ‘because of this, I am like that,’ ‘because of this, I am different,’ ‘because of this, I am everlasting,’ ‘because of this, I am impermanent.’ There arise such notions as: ‘Because of this, I may be,’ ‘because of this, I may be thus,’ ‘because of this, I may be like that,’ ‘because of this, I may be different.’ There arise such notions as: ‘Because of this, may I be,’ ‘because of this, may I be thus,’ ‘because of this, may I be like that,’ ‘because of this, may I be different.’ There arise such notions as: ‘Because of this, I shall be,’ ‘because of this, I shall be thus,’ ‘because of this, I shall be like that,’ ‘because of this, I shall be different.’ These are the eighteen mental stirrings of craving dependent on the external.

Thus, there are eighteen mental stirrings of craving dependent on the internal, and eighteen mental stirrings of craving dependent on the external. These are called, bhikkhus, the thirty-six mental stirrings of craving. In this way, there are thirty-six such mental stirrings of craving in the past, thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six in the present. Thus, there are one hundred and eight mental stirrings of craving.

This, bhikkhus, is that craving—entangling, flowing, spreading, and ensnaring—by which this world is smothered and enveloped, becoming like a tangled ball of thread, a matted bird’s nest, entwined like Muñja grass and reeds, unable to transcend the plane of misery, the bad destination, the realm of downfall, and the cycle of existence.”
