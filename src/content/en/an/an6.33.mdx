“Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, a certain deity, radiant in appearance and illuminating almost the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached me. Having drawn near and paid homage to me, she stood to one side. Standing there, that deity said this to me: ‘Venerable sir, there are these six qualities that ensure the |non-decline::non-regressing [aparihāna]| of a bhikkhu. What six? 1) |Respect::reverence, esteem [gārava]| for the |Teacher::The Buddha [satthā]|, 2) respect for the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, 3) respect for the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]|, 4) respect for the training, 5) respect for |conscience::internal sense of right and wrong used for guiding one's behavior, moral shame, scruple [hirī]|, 6) respect for |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]|. These, venerable sir, are the six qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu.’”

This is what that deity said. After saying this, she paid homage to me, circumambulated me, and vanished right there.

Respectful of the teacher, respectful of the Dhamma,
and with keen respect towards the Saṅgha;
Endowed with conscience and moral fear,
|agreeable::deferential, polite, obedient [sappatissa]| and respectful in conduct;
is incapable of decline,
and truly close to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.”
