At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

"Bhikkhus, there are these seven qualities that lead to the decline of a trainee bhikkhu. What seven? Relishing work, relishing talk, relishing sleep, relishing pleasure of company, being unguarded in sense faculties, lack of moderation in eating, and moreover there are communal duties. There, a trainee reflects, 'There are elders in the Saṅgha who are experienced, long gone forth, bearing the burden; they will be recognized for this.' Yet, he still engages in these duties himself. These seven qualities lead to the decline of a trainee bhikkhu.

Bhikkhus, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a trainee bhikkhu. What seven? Not relishing work, not relishing talk, not relishing sleep, not relishing pleasure of company, being guarded in sense faculties, having moderation in eating, and moreover, there are communal duties. There, a trainee reflects, 'There are elders in the Saṅgha who are experienced, long gone forth, bearing the burden; they will be recognized for this.'' Therefore, he does not engage in these duties himself. These seven qualities lead to the non-decline of a trainee bhikkhu."
