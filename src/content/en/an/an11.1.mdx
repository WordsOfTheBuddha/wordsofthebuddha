Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park.

Then, venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:

1 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| |ethical conduct::virtue, moral integrity [sīla]|? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of wholesome ethical conduct, Ānanda, is |non-regret::not experiencing remorse [avippaṭisāra]|; its benefit is non-regret."

2 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of non-regret? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of non-regret, Ānanda, is |joy::happiness, gladness [pāmojja]|; its benefit is joy."

3 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of joy? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of joy, Ānanda, is |joyful pleasure::heartfelt or intense joy, feeling of love, rapture lit. lovely feeling [pīti]|; its benefit is joyful pleasure."

4 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of joyful pleasure? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of joyful pleasure, Ānanda, is |tranquility::peace, serenity, stillness [passaddhi]|; its benefit is tranquility."

5 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of tranquility? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of tranquility, Ānanda, is |ease::contentment, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]|; its benefit is ease."

6 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of ease? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of ease, Ānanda, is |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure, concentration [samādhi]|; its benefit is collectedness."

7 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of collectedness? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of collectedness, Ānanda, is |understanding and insight into things as they truly are::knowing and seeing reality [yathābhūtañāṇadassana]|; its benefit is understanding and insight into things as they truly are."

8 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of understanding and insight into things as they truly are? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of understanding and insight into things as they truly are, Ānanda, is |disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]|; its benefit is disenchantment."

9 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of disenchantment? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of disenchantment, Ānanda, is |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|; its benefit is fading of desire."

10 "Venerable sir, what is the purpose of fading of desire? What is its benefit?"

"The purpose of fading of desire, Ānanda, is |understanding and insight into liberation::knowledge and vision of liberation, total understanding of emancipation [vimuttiñāṇadassana]|; its benefit is understanding and insight into liberation.

Thus, Ānanda, wholesome ethical conduct has non-regret as its purpose and benefit. Non-regret has joy as its purpose and benefit. Joy has joyful pleasure as its purpose and benefit. Joyful pleasure has tranquility as its purpose and benefit. Tranquility has ease as its purpose and benefit. Ease has collectedness as its purpose and benefit. Collectedness has understanding and insight into things as they truly are as its purpose and benefit. Understanding and insight into things as they truly are has disenchantment as its purpose and benefit. Disenchantment has fading of desire as its purpose and benefit. Fading of desire has understanding and insight into liberation as its purpose and benefit. Thus, Ānanda, wholesome ethical conduct gradually leads step by step to the |ultimate::foremost, chief [agga]|."
