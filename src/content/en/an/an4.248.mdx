“Bhikkhus, these four things lead to the growth of wisdom. What four? Associating with good people, listening to the true Dhamma, |wise attention::proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yoniso manasikāra]|, and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma. These are the four things that lead to the growth of wisdom.”
