Thus have I heard—At At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the |Vajji::a republic or confederation in ancient India, located in what is today northern Bihar, near the modern city of Vaishali| people, in the village of Bhaṇḍa. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, it is because of |misunderstanding::non-comprehension of [ananubodha]| and \|not penetrating::not being able to make a breakthrough of understanding [appaṭivedha]| four |principles::characteristics [dhammā]|, both you and I have |wandered::transmigrated [sandhāvita]| and undergone this journey of \|cyclic existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]| for a long time. What four?

1 Bhikkhus, it is because of misunderstanding and not penetrating noble \|ethical conduct::virtue, moral integrity [sīla]| that both you and I have wandered and undergone this long journey of cyclic existence for a long time.

2 Bhikkhus, it is because of misunderstanding and not penetrating noble |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| that both you and I have wandered and undergone this long journey of cyclic existence for a long time.

3 Bhikkhus, it is because of misunderstanding and not penetrating noble |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]| that both you and I have wandered and undergone this long journey of cyclic existence for a long time.

4 Bhikkhus, it is because of misunderstanding and not penetrating noble |liberation::release, freedom [vimutti]| that both you and I have wandered and undergone this long journey of cyclic existence for a long time.

But now, bhikkhus, having |understood::recognized [anubuddha]| and |penetrated::making a breakthrough of understanding [paṭividdha]| noble ethical conduct, noble collectedness, noble wisdom, and noble liberation; the \|craving for existence::craving for becoming [bhavataṇhā]| is severed, the conduit to existence is completely |exhausted::depleted, finished [khīṇa]|; there is now no more \|renewed existence::future life [punabbhava]|."

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Well-Gone One further said this:

"Ethical conduct, collectedness, wisdom,
and |unsurpassed::highest, incomparable [anuttara]| liberation;
These principles have been understood,
by Gotama, the illustrious one.

Thus, the Buddha, having \|directly known::experientially understood [abhiññāya]|,
clarified the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| to the bhikkhus;
The teacher, the end maker of suffering,
the one with vision, has \|completely quenched [mental defilements]::completely cooled mental defilements [parinibbuta]|."
