At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Nātika::name of a village situated in the middle country of ancient India [nātika]| in the brick house. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, |recollection of death::keeping death in mind [maraṇassati]|, when cultivated and frequently practiced, is of great fruit and great benefit; it leads to the deathless and it |culminates in the deathless::ends in the deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amatapariyosāna]|. But do you, bhikkhus, develop recollection of death?”

1.) When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I do develop recollection of death.”

“And how, bhikkhu, do you develop recollection of death?”

“Here, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' In this way, venerable sir, I develop recollection of death.”

2.) Then another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “I too, venerable sir, develop recollection of death.”

“And how, bhikkhu, do you develop recollection of death?”

“Here, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' In this way, venerable sir, I develop recollection of death.”

3.) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “I too, venerable sir, develop recollection of death.”

“And how, bhikkhu, do you develop recollection of death?”

“Here, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘May I live just the time it takes to eat a single alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' In this way, venerable sir, I develop recollection of death.”

4.) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “I too, venerable sir, develop recollection of death.”

“And how, bhikkhu, do you develop recollection of death?”

“Here, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘May I live just the time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much! In this way, venerable sir, I develop recollection of death.”

5.) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “I too, venerable sir, develop recollection of death.”

“And how, bhikkhu, do you develop recollection of death?”

“Here, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘May I live just the time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' In this way, venerable sir, I develop recollection of death.”

6.) Still another bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “I too, venerable sir, develop recollection of death.”

“And how, bhikkhu, do you develop recollection of death?”

“Here, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘May I live just the time it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' In this way, venerable sir, I develop recollection of death.”

When this was said, the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, 1.) take the bhikkhu who develops recollection of death in this way: ‘May I live just a night and a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' 2.) Or take the bhikkhu who develops recollection of death in this way: ‘May I live just a day so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' 3.) Or take the bhikkhu who develops recollection of death in this way: ‘May I live just the time it takes to eat a single alms meal so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' 4.) Or take the bhikkhu who develops recollection of death in this way: ‘May I live just the time it takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' These, bhikkhus, are the bhikkhus who dwell |negligently::inattentively, carelessly [pamatta]| and develop recollection of death sluggishly, not for the |wearing away of the taints::gradual exhaustion and elimination of the mental defilements or deep-seated afflictions such as sensual desire, craving for existence, views, and ignorance [āsava + khaya]|.

But 5.) the bhikkhu who develops recollection of death in this way: ‘May I live just the time it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful of food so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' 6.) Or take the bhikkhu who develops recollection of death in this way: ‘May I live just the time it takes to breathe out after breathing in, or to breathe in after breathing out, so that I may attend to the Blessed One’s teaching. I could then accomplish much!' These, bhikkhus, are the bhikkhus who dwell |with diligence::quality of doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]| and develop recollection of death |keenly::sharply, with vigor [tikkha]|, for the wearing away of the taints.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will dwell with diligence. We will develop recollection of death keenly for the wearing away of the taints.’ That is how you should train yourselves.”
