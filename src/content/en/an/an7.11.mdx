“Bhikkhus, there are these seven |underlying tendencies::dormant dispositions; lit: sleeping alongside [anusayā]|. What seven?

1) The underlying tendency toward |sensual desire::passion or lust for sensual pleasures [kāmarāga]|,
2) the underlying tendency toward |repulsion::resistance, irritation, conflict [paṭigha]|,
3) the underlying tendency toward views,
4) the underlying tendency toward |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness [vicikiccha]|,
5) the underlying tendency toward |pride::conceit, egotism, superiority, comparing oneself [māna]|,
6) the underlying tendency toward passion for |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|, and
7) the underlying tendency toward |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|.

These, bhikkhus, are the seven underlying tendencies.”
