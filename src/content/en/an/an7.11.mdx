“Bhikkhus, there are these seven |underlying tendencies::dormant dispositions; lit: sleeping alongside [anusayā]|. What seven?

1) The underlying tendency toward |sensual desire::passion or lust for sensual pleasures [kāmarāga]|,
2) the underlying tendency toward |aversion::mental resistance, irritation, conflict [paṭigha]|,
3) the |underlying tendency toward views::inherent inclination towards opinions, underlying conceptual beliefs; lit. views sleeping alongside [diṭṭhānusaya]|,
4) the underlying tendency toward |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness wrt suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering [vicikiccha]|,
5) the underlying tendency toward |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|,
6) the underlying tendency toward passion for |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|, and
7) the underlying tendency toward |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|.

These, bhikkhus, are the seven underlying tendencies.”
