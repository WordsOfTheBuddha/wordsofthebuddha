“Bhikkhus, there are these seven principles that lead to the |decline::regression, deterioration [parihāna]| of a lay follower. What seven? 1.) He delays seeing bhikkhus, 2.) he neglects listening to the true |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, 3.) he does not train in |higher virtue::higher conduct [adhisīla]|, 4.) he is |full of distrust::suspicious [appasādabahula]|, 5.) when listening to the Dhamma from senior bhikkhus, new bhikkhus, or those of middle standing, he listens |with a fault-finding mind::with a critical attitude [upārambhacitta]|, seeking to find faults, 6.) he seeks a person worthy of offerings outside [the Saṅgha], and 7.) he makes an initial offering there. These, bhikkhus, are the seven principles that lead to the decline of a lay follower.

Bhikkhus, there are these seven principles that lead to the non-decline of a lay follower. What seven? 1.) He does not delay seeing bhikkhus, 2.) he does not neglect listening to the true Dhamma, 3.) he trains in higher virtue, 4.) he is full of faith, 5.) when listening to the Dhamma from senior bhikkhus, new bhikkhus, or those of middle standing, he listens without a fault-finding mind, not seeking to find faults, 6.) he does not seek a person worthy of offerings outside [the Saṅgha], and 7.) he makes an initial offering here. These, bhikkhus, are the seven principles that lead to the non-decline of a lay follower.”

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Accomplished One further said this:

“The lay follower who delays,
seeing the |well-trained ones::awakened ones; lit. ones with developed self [bhāvitattā]|;
[who neglects] listening to the true Dhamma,
and does not train in higher virtue.

His distrust in the bhikkhus,
grows more and more;
With a fault-finding mind,
he wishes to hear the true Dhamma.

Looking outside, he seeks another,
as worthy of offerings;
And there he makes his first offering,
such is that lay follower.

These seven well taught principles,
describe what leads to decline;
The lay follower for resorts to them,
declines from the true Dhamma.

The lay follower for does not delay,
seeing the well-trained ones;
[who does not neglect] listening to the true Dhamma,
and trains in higher virtue.

His confidence in the bhikkhus,
grows more and more;
Without a fault-finding mind,
he wishes to hear the true Dhamma.

He does not look outside for another,
as worthy of offerings;
And here he makes his first offering,
such is that lay follower.

These seven well taught principles,
describe what leads to non-decline;
The lay follower who practices in them,
does not decline from the true Dhamma.”
