"Bhikkhus, there are these five subjects that \|should be frequently reflected::should be regularly considered, contemplated, reviewed [abhiṇha + paccavekkhitabba]|, whether by a woman, a man, a householder, or \|one gone forth::renunciate, ordained [pabbajita]|. What five?

1 '\|I am subject to aging::I am liable to grow old [jarādhammomhi]|, I am not exempt from growing old.' This should be frequently reflected upon by a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth.

2 '\|I am subject to illness::I am liable to get sick, I am subject to disease [byādhidhammomhi]|, I am not exempt from illness.' This should be frequently reflected upon by a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth.

3 '\|I am subject to death::I am liable to die [maraṇadhammomhi]|, I am not exempt from death.' This should be frequently reflected upon by a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth.

4 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and |pleasing::agreeable, likeable [manāpa]| to me.' This should be frequently reflected upon by a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth.

5 'I am the owner of my |actions::deeds, doings [kamma]|, the heir of my actions, born of my actions, related to my actions, and dependent on my actions.

Whatever actions I will do—whether good or bad—I will be the heir of those actions.' This should be frequently reflected upon by a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth.

### Benefit of Frequent Reflection

1 For the sake of what benefit should a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth frequently reflect thus: 'I am subject to aging, I am not exempt from growing old'? In their youth, beings \|are intoxicated::have vanity, pride, conceit [mada]| with their youth, and when they are intoxicated with their youth, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one frequently reflects upon this subject, the intoxication with their youth is either entirely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth should frequently reflect thus: 'I am subject to aging, I am not exempt from growing old.'

2 And for the sake of what benefit should a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth frequently reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness, I am not exempt from illness'? In a state of health, beings are intoxicated with their health, and when they are intoxicated with their health, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one frequently reflects upon this subject, the intoxication with their health is either entirely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth should frequently reflect thus: 'I am subject to illness, I am not exempt from illness.'

3 And for the sake of what benefit should a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth frequently reflect thus: 'I am subject to death, I am not exempt from death'? During their lives, beings are intoxicated with life, and when they are intoxicated with life, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one frequently reflects upon this subject, the intoxication with life is either entirely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth should frequently reflect thus: 'I am subject to death, I am not exempt from death.'

4 And for the sake of what benefit should a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth frequently reflect thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and pleasing to me'? Beings have \|desire and lust::attachment and passion [chandarāga]| in regard to those people and things that are dear and pleasing, and \|infatuated by::inflamed by, enamoured by [rattā]| this |desire::passion, lust [rāga]|, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one frequently reflects upon this subject, the desire and lust in regard to everyone and everything dear and pleasing is either entirely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth should frequently reflect thus: 'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and pleasing to me.'

5 And for the sake of what benefit should a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth frequently reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my actions, the heir of my actions, born of my actions, related to my actions, and dependent on my actions. Whatever actions I will do—whether good or bad—I will be the heir of those actions'? Beings engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one frequently reflects upon this subject, such misconduct is either entirely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman, a man, a householder, or one gone forth should frequently reflect thus: 'I am the owner of my actions, the heir of my actions, born of my actions, related to my actions, and dependent on my actions. Whatever actions I will do—whether good or bad—I will be the heir of those actions.'

### Disciple of the Noble Ones

They pursue, develop, and cultivate that path. For one who pursues, develops, and cultivates that path, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the \|underlying tendencies::latent dispositions [anusayā]| are |uprooted::eliminated [byantīhoti]|.

### Verse

Subject to illness, subject to aging,
and also subject to death;
Worldlings are |repulsed::disgusted [jigucchati]| [by other people],
who exist in accordance with their nature.

If I were to be repulsed,
with beings who have such a nature;
It would not be proper for me,
since I too have the same nature.

While I was dwelling thus,
having known the state \|free from attachment::free from grasping, not taking as mine, not appropriating [nirūpadhi]|;
I overcame all intoxications—
intoxication with health, with youth,
and intoxication with life—
having seen peace in |renunciation::going out state, rejection of sensual pleasure [nekkhamma]|;
|Zeal::enthusiasm [ussāha]| then arose in me,
as I clearly saw |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.

Now I am incapable,
of indulging in sensual pleasures;
I will \|not be turning back::not be returning [anivatti]| now,
taking refuge in the spiritual life.
