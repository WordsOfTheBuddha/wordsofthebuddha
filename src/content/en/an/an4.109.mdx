“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of trees. What four?

The one made of |softwood::sapwood, hollow, valueless wood next to the heartwood [pheggu]| that is surrounded by softwood [trees],
The one made of softwood that is surrounded by heartwood trees,
The one made of |heartwood::hardwood, solid [sāra]| that is surrounded by softwood trees,
The one made of heartwood that is surrounded by heartwood trees.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of trees. In the same way, bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

The one made of softwood that is surrounded by softwood,
The one made of softwood that is surrounded by heartwood,
The one made of heartwood that is surrounded by softwood,
The one made of heartwood that is surrounded by heartwood.

1 And how, bhikkhus, is a person made of softwood and surrounded by softwood? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]| and |endowed with harmful qualities::one who has had a long association of harmful mental qualities - of negligence, laziness, having many wishes, irrational application of mind, lack of situational awareness, having bad friends, pursuing bad habits [pāpadhamma]|, and their |associates::circle, community, following [parisā]| are also unprincipled and endowed with harmful qualities. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is made of softwood and surrounded by softwood. Just as, bhikkhus, a tree made of softwood is surrounded by softwood tress, so too, bhikkhus, I speak of this kind of person as its counterpart.

2 And how, bhikkhus, is a person made of softwood and surrounded by heartwood? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is unprincipled and endowed with harmful qualities, but their associates are |virtuous::ethical, upright [sīlavatī]| and |endowed with wholesome qualities::one who has had a long association of wholesome mental qualities - of diligence, aroused energy, having few wishes, rational application of mind, having situational awareness, having good friends, pursuing good habits [kalyāṇadhamma]|. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is made of softwood and surrounded by heartwood. Just as, bhikkhus, a tree made of softwood is surrounded by heartwood trees, so too, bhikkhus, I speak of this kind of person as its counterpart.

3 And how, bhikkhus, is a person made of heartwood and surrounded by softwood? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is virtuous and endowed with wholesome qualities, but their associates are unprincipled and endowed with harmful qualities. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is made of heartwood and surrounded by softwood. Just as, bhikkhus, a tree made of heartwood is surrounded by softwood trees, so too, bhikkhus, I speak of this kind of person as its counterpart.

4 And how, bhikkhus, is a person made of heartwood and surrounded by heartwood? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is virtuous and endowed with wholesome qualities, and their associates are virtuous and endowed with wholesome qualities. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is made of heartwood and surrounded by heartwood. Just as, bhikkhus, a tree made of heartwood is surrounded by heartwood trees, so too, bhikkhus, I speak of this kind of person as its counterpart.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons comparable to trees, found existing in the world.
