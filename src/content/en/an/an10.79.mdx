“Bhikkhus, there are these ten grounds for resentment. Which ten? One harbors resentment thinking: 1.) ‘They harmed me.’ 2.) ‘They are harming me.’ 3.) ‘They will harm me.’ 4.) ‘They harmed someone |dear::beloved [piya]| and |agreeable::pleasant, likable [manāpa]| to me.’ 5.) ‘They are harming someone dear and agreeable to me.’ 6.) ‘They will harm someone dear and agreeable to me.’ 7.) ‘They acted for the benefit of someone who is displeasing and disagreeable to me.’ 8.) ‘They are acting for the benefit of someone who is displeasing and disagreeable to me.’ 9.) ‘They will act for the benefit of someone who is displeasing and disagreeable to me.’ and 10.) One becomes |upset::agitated, disturbed, shaken [kuppati]| without a reason. These, bhikkhus, are the ten grounds for resentment.”
