"Bhikkhus, when the mind of a bhikkhu is thoroughly cultivated with wisdom, it is proper for that bhikkhu to declare: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.'"

"And how, bhikkhus, is the mind of a bhikkhu thoroughly cultivated with wisdom? 'My mind is free from passion' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is free from aversion' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is free from delusion' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is free from the tendencies of passion' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is free from the tendencies of aversion' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is free from the tendencies of delusion' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is not liable to return to the realm of sensual existence' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is not liable to return to the realm of form existence' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated; 'My mind is not liable to return to the realm of formless existence' - thus with wisdom the mind is thoroughly cultivated. When indeed, bhikkhus, the mind of a bhikkhu is thoroughly cultivated with wisdom, it is proper for that bhikkhu to declare: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.'"
