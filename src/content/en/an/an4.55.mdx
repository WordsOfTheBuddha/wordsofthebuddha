Thus have I heard—At At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Bhaggans (name of the people of Bhagga [bhaggā]) in \{Crocodile Mountain} (name of the capital city of Bhagga [susumāragira]), in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Grove.

Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went to the residence of the householder Nakulapitā (Nakula's father [nakulapitar]). Having arrived, he sat down on the seat that was prepared.

Then the householder Nakulapitā and the housewife Nakulamātā (Nakula's mother, wife of Nakulapitā [nakulamātā]) approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the householder Nakulapitā said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, since I was young, when the young girl Nakulamātā was given to me in marriage, I do not recall ever transgressing against her even in thought, much less by deed. Venerable sir, we wish that in this very life we may continue to see one another, and also that we may see one another again \{in the next life} (in a future existence [abhisamparāyaṃ])."

Then Nakulamātā, the housewife, also said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, since I was young, when I was given to the householder Nakulapitā in marriage, I do not recall ever transgressing against him even in thought, much less by deed. Venerable sir, we wish that in this very life we may continue to see one another, and also that we may see one another again in the next life."

"Householders, if both husband and wife wish to see one another in this very life and also to meet one another again in the next life, both should be \{with the same faith} (alike in confidence [samasaddha]), \{with the same ethical conduct} (alike in virtue, morality [samasīlā]), \{with the same generosity} (alike in giving [samacāga]), and \{with the same wisdom} (alike in understanding [samapañña]). Then they will see one another in this very life, and they will meet one another again in the next life."

### Verse

"Both are faithful and generous,
restrained and living in accordance with the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]);
They become husband and wife,
speaking kindly to one another.

Then plentiful benefits arise [for them],
and they dwell in ease;
Their enemies are dejected,
when both are the same in ethical conduct.

Having lived by the Dhamma here,
both with the same precepts and practices;
They delight [after death] in a heavenly world,
pleased, enjoying sensual pleasures."
