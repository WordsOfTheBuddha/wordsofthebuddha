“Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of gifts of a |true person::good person, worthy one, awakened being [sappurisa]|. What five? 1) One gives a gift out of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|; 2) one gives a gift respectfully; 3) one gives a gift at a suitable time; 4) one gives a gift |unreservedly::not grasping in one's thoughts [anuggahitacitta]|; 5) one gives a gift without injuring oneself or another.

1) When one gives a gift out of faith, bhikkhus, then wherever the result of that gift manifests [whether in this life or beyond], one becomes wealthy, rich, and abundantly endowed with possessions. One is |lovely::beautiful, handsome [abhirūpa]|, pleasing to see, and endowed with the supreme beauty of complexion.

2) When one gives a gift respectfully, bhikkhus, then wherever the result of that gift manifests, one becomes wealthy, rich, and abundantly endowed with possessions. And his children and wives, slaves, servants, or workers — they too wish to listen, lend their ears, and apply their minds to understand.

3) When one gives a gift at a suitable time, bhikkhus, then wherever the result of that gift manifests, one becomes wealthy, rich, and abundantly endowed with possessions; and many timely benefits arise for them.

4) When one gives a gift unreservedly, bhikkhus, then wherever the result of that gift manifests, one becomes wealthy, rich, and abundantly endowed with possessions; and their mind inclines to the enjoyment of the five cords of sensual pleasure.

5) When one gives a gift without injuring oneself or another, bhikkhus, then wherever the result of that gift manifests, one becomes wealthy, rich, and abundantly endowed with possessions; nor does any harm come to his wealth from any source, whether from fire, water, kings, thieves, or displeasing heirs.

These, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of gifts of a true person.”
