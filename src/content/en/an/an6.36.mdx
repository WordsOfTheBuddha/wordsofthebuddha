"Bhikkhus, there are these six roots of disputes. What six?

1 Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is |irritable::prone to anger [kodhana]| and |resentful::who bears a grudge, who harbors enmity [upanāhī]|. When a bhikkhu is irritable and resentful, he dwells without respect and |deference::without politeness, without regard [appatissa]| toward the Teacher, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, and the |Saṅgha::the community of followers of the Buddha, whether lay or monastic, who have attained to one of the four stages of awakening [saṅgha]|, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. If, bhikkhus, you see such a root of dispute within yourselves or in others, you should practice to ensure that this |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| root of dispute does not arise in the future. In this way, there is the abandoning of this harmful root of dispute. In this way, there is non-arising of this harmful root of dispute in the future.

2 Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is a |denigrator::who slanders [makkhī]| and |contentious::stubborn, arrogant [paḷāsī]|. When a bhikkhu is a denigrator and contentious, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. If, bhikkhus, you see such a root of dispute within yourselves or in others, you should practice to ensure that this harmful root of dispute does not arise in the future. In this way, there is the abandoning of this harmful root of dispute. In this way, there is non-arising of this harmful root of dispute in the future.

3 Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is |envious::jealous, covetous [issukī]| and |miserly::stingy, greedy [maccharī]|. When a bhikkhu is envious and miserly, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. If, bhikkhus, you see such a root of dispute within yourselves or in others, you should practice to ensure that this harmful root of dispute does not arise in the future. In this way, there is the abandoning of this harmful root of dispute. In this way, there is non-arising of this harmful root of dispute in the future.

4 Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is |deceitful::dishonest, cunning [saṭha]| and |hypocritical::pretentious [māyāvī]|. When a bhikkhu is deceitful and hypocritical, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. If, bhikkhus, you see such a root of dispute within yourselves or in others, you should practice to ensure that this harmful root of dispute does not arise in the future. In this way, there is the abandoning of this harmful root of dispute. In this way, there is non-arising of this harmful root of dispute in the future.

5 Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu |has evil desires::has evil wishes [pāpiccho]| and holds |wrong view::distorted perceptions, untrue views, false beliefs [micchādiṭṭhi]|. When a bhikkhu has evil desires and holds wrong view, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. If, bhikkhus, you see such a root of dispute within yourselves or in others, you should practice to ensure that this harmful root of dispute does not arise in the future. In this way, there is the abandoning of this harmful root of dispute. In this way, there is non-arising of this harmful root of dispute in the future.

6 Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is |clinging to his own views::who adheres to his own belief system [sandiṭṭhiparāmāsī]|, |holding on tightly::clutching [ādhānaggāhī]|, and |giving up with difficulty::not relinquishing quickly [duppaṭinissaggī]|. When a bhikkhu is clinging to his own views, holding on tightly, and giving up with difficulty, he dwells without respect and deference toward the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and he does not fulfill the training. Such a bhikkhu creates a dispute in the Saṅgha that leads to the harm of many people, to the unhappiness of many people, to the ruin, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. If, bhikkhus, you see such a root of dispute within yourselves or in others, you should practice to ensure that this harmful root of dispute does not arise in the future. In this way, there is the abandoning of this harmful root of dispute. In this way, there is non-arising of this harmful root of dispute in the future.

These, bhikkhus, are the six roots of disputes."
