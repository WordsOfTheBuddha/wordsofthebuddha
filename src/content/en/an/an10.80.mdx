“Bhikkhus, there are these ten ways for removing |resentment::annoyance, irritation, loathing; lit. collision [āghāta]|. What ten? 1.) Thinking: ‘They harmed me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 2.) Thinking: ‘They are harming me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 3.) Thinking: ‘They will harm me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 4.) Thinking: ‘They harmed someone dear and agreeable to me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 5.) Thinking: ‘They are harming someone dear and agreeable to me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 6.) Thinking: ‘They will harm someone dear and agreeable to me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 7.) Thinking: ‘They acted for the benefit of someone who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 8.) Thinking: ‘They are acting for the benefit of someone who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 9.) Thinking: ‘They will act for the benefit of someone who is displeasing and disagreeable to me, but what can be done about that?’ one removes resentment. 10.) And one does not get |upset::agitated, disturbed, shaken [kuppati]| without a reason. These, bhikkhus, are the ten ways for removing resentment.”
