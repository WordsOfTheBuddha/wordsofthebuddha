Then the wanderer Potaliya approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One. After having engaged in cordial and polite conversation, he sat to one side. As he was seated to one side, the Blessed One addressed him:

"Potaliya, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

1 Here, Potaliya, a certain person |criticizes::dispraises, blames [avaṇṇa]| someone |who is worthy of criticism::blameworthy, who is not worthy of praise [avaṇṇāraha]|, speaking what is |accurate::correct, found to be existing [bhūta]|, |actual::as it is, real [taccha]| and |at the right time::at an appropriate moment [kālena]|; yet he does not offer |praise::approval [vaṇṇa]| to someone who is |worthy of praise::deserving approval [vaṇṇāraha]|, even when the praise would be accurate, actual, and timely.

2 Then, Potaliya, a certain person offers praise to someone who is worthy of praise, speaking what is accurate, actual, and at the right time; yet he does not speak in criticism of someone who is worthy of criticism, even when the criticism would be accurate, actual, and timely.

3 Then, Potaliya, a certain person does not speak in criticism of someone who is worthy of criticism, even when the criticism would be accurate, actual, and timely; nor does he offer praise to someone who is worthy of praise, even when the praise would be accurate, actual, and timely.

4 Then, Potaliya, a certain person criticizes someone who is worthy of criticism, speaking what is accurate, actual, and at the right time; and he offers praise to someone who is worthy of praise, speaking what is accurate, actual, and at the right time.

These, Potaliya, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world. Now, of these four kinds of persons, Potaliya, which one seems to you the |most excellent::more excellent [than], more brilliant [than] [abhikkantatara]| and the |most sublime::more refined [than] [paṇītatara]|?"

"There are, friend Gotama, these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. ... Of these four kinds of persons, the one who seems to me the most excellent and the most sublime is the person who neither speaks in criticism of someone who is worthy of criticism, even when the criticism would be accurate, actual, and timely; nor offers praise to someone who is worthy of praise, even when the praise would be accurate, actual, and timely. For what reason? Because what is most surpassing, friend Gotama, is |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|."

"There are, Potaliya, these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. ... Of these four kinds of persons, the one who is the most excellent and the most sublime is the person who both criticizes someone who is worthy of criticism, speaking what is accurate, actual, and at the right time; and offers praise to someone who is worthy of praise, speaking what is accurate, actual, and at the right time. For what reason? Because, Potaliya, what is most surpassing is precisely knowing the |appropriateness::knowledge of the right time [kālaññutā]| |in each situation::in each and every situation [tattha tattha]|."

"There are, friend Gotama, these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. ... Of these four kinds of persons, the one who seems to me the most excellent and the most sublime is the person who both criticizes someone who is worthy of criticism, speaking what is accurate, actual, and at the right time; and offers praise to someone who is worthy of praise, speaking what is accurate, actual, and at the right time. For what reason? Because what is most surpassing, friend Gotama, is precisely knowing the appropriateness in each situation.

Excellent, friend Gotama! Excellent, friend Gotama! Just as if one might set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way, friend Gotama, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by you in many ways. I go for refuge to venerable Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the community of bhikkhus. May venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life."
