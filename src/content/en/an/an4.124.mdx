“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

1.) Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. In this state, he perceives whatever phenomena are present — whether |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one’s body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]|, |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks sensory information by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, |intentional constructs::the constructive activity that shapes each moment of experience, expressed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations; the accumulated conditioning — patterns, tendencies, and habits — produced by prior action [saṅkhāra]|, or |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]| — as |impermanent::not lasting, transient, unreliable [anicca]|, |unsatisfactory::uncomfortable, unpleasant [dukkha]|, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and |not-self::not suitable to identify with, impersonality [anatta]|. After the breaking up of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the |Pure Abodes::name of five heavens in the Brahma realm; lit. pure land [suddhāvāsa]|. This rebirth, bhikkhus, is not shared with the ordinary persons.

2.) Again, bhikkhus, here a certain person, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, in the third jhāna, in the fourth jhāna. In this state, he perceives whatever phenomena are present — whether form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, or consciousness — as impermanent, unsatisfactory, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. After the breaking up of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the Pure Abodes. This rebirth, bhikkhus, is not shared with the ordinary persons.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
