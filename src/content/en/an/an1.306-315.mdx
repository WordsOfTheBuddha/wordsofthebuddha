#### 1.306

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expand as much as |wrong view::distorted perceptions, untrue views, false beliefs [micchādiṭṭhi]|. For one with wrong view, unarisen unwholesome qualities arise, and arisen unwholesome qualities increase and expand.”

#### 1.307

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expand as much as |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|. For one with right view, unarisen wholesome qualities arise, and arisen wholesome qualities increase and expand.”

#### 1.308

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wholesome qualities do not arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline as much as wrong view. For one with wrong view, unarisen wholesome qualities do not arise, and arisen wholesome qualities decline.”

#### 1.309

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen unwholesome qualities do not arise and arisen unwholesome qualities decline as much as right view. For one with right view, unarisen unwholesome qualities do not arise, and arisen unwholesome qualities decline.”

#### 1.310

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen wrong view arises and arisen wrong view grows as much as |unwise attention::improper attention, imprudent use of the mind [ayonisomanasikāra]|. Bhikkhus, for one who attends unwisely, unarisen wrong view arises, and arisen wrong view grows.”

#### 1.311

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen right view arises and arisen right view grows as much as wise attention. Bhikkhus, for one who attends wisely, unarisen right view arises, and arisen right view grows.”

#### 1.312

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which beings, with the breakup of the body after death, arise in a state of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell, as much as wrong view. Bhikkhus, beings who are possessed of wrong view, with the breakup of the body after death, arise in a state of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell.”

#### 1.313

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of which beings, with the breakup of the body after death, arise in a good destination, in the heavenly world, as much as right view. Bhikkhus, beings who are possessed of right view, with the breakup of the body after death, arise in a good destination, in the heavenly world.”

#### 1.314

“Bhikkhus, in the case of a person with wrong view, whatever bodily action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, whatever verbal action and whatever mental action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, along with whatever |intention::will [cetanā]|, |wish::a prayer, a longing [patthanā]|, |aspiration::a determination [paṇidhi]|, and |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, and choices expressed as mental, verbal, and bodily activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); processes that produce kamma [saṅkhāra]|—all these states lead to what is unwished for, unpleasant, disagreeable, unbeneficial, and |unsatisfactory::distressful, unfulfilling, marked by discontent [dukkha]|. For what reason? Because that view is bad.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a seed of neem, a seed of bitter cucumber, or a seed of bitter gourd were planted in moist soil. Whatever nutrients it absorbs from the soil and from the water, all lead to its bitter, pungent, and unappealing taste. For what reason? Because that seed is bad.

In the same way, bhikkhus, in the case of a person with wrong view, whatever bodily action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, whatever verbal action and whatever mental action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, along with whatever intention, wish, aspiration, and intentional constructs—all these states lead to what is unwished for, unpleasant, disagreeable, unbeneficial, and unsatisfactory. For what reason? Because that view is bad.”

#### 1.315

“Bhikkhus, in the case of a person with right view, whatever bodily action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, whatever verbal action and whatever mental action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, along with whatever intention, wish, aspiration, and intentional constructs—all these states lead to what is wished for, pleasant, agreeable, beneficial, and |happiness::ease, comfort, contentedness [sukhāya]|. For what reason? Because that view is good.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a seed of sugarcane, a seed of rice, or a seed of grape were planted in moist soil. Whatever nutrients it absorbs from the soil and from the water, all lead to its sweet, disagreeable, and delicious taste. For what reason? Because that seed is good.

In the same way, bhikkhus, in the case of a person with right view, whatever bodily action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, whatever verbal action and whatever mental action is adopted and undertaken in line with that view, along with whatever intention, wish, aspiration, and intentional constructs—all these states lead to what is wished for, pleasant, agreeable, beneficial, and happiness. For what reason? Because that view is good.”
