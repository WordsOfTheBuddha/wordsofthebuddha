“Bhikkhus, these are the four right strivings. What four? Striving for restraint, striving to abandon, striving to cultivate, and striving to protect.

1.) And what, bhikkhus, is striving for restraint? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having seen a |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| with the eye, does not |grasp at its prominent features::focusing on its external characteristics [nimittaggāhī]| nor is |enticed by its details::focused on its secondary characteristics [anubyañjanaggāhī]|. For if he were to dwell with the eye faculty unguarded, |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| states of |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| might |stream in::flood in, overwhelm him [anvāssavati]|. Therefore, he practices restraint in this regard, guards the eye faculty, and attains the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a |sound::an auditory object such as a sound, noise, melody, or verbal expression—whether it be praise, blame, honor, affection, or disrespect—that can stir emotion, memory, or craving [sadda]| with the ear, having smelled an |odor::a smell or scent such as a fragrance, aroma, stench, perfume, or natural odor from a flower, food, or the earth—an olfactory experience that may trigger memory, comfort, craving, or aversion [gandha]| with nose, having tasted a |flavor::a taste or flavor such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle notes like umami or astringency—an object of gustatory experience that can become desirable, comforting, or indulgent [rasa]| with the tongue, having touched a |tangible object::a tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, or pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| with the body, or having cognized a |mental object::a mind object such as a thought, idea, memory, intention, emotion, image, or concept arising within the mind that becomes the object of awareness, reflection, craving, or aversion [dhamma]| with the mind, he does not grasp at its prominent features nor is enticed by its details. For if he were to dwell with the mind faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in. Therefore, he practices restraint in this regard, guards the mind faculty, and attains the restraint of the mind faculty. This, bhikkhus, is called striving for restraint.

2.) And what, bhikkhus, is striving to abandon? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, wisely reflecting, does not tolerate an arisen |thought of sensuality::thought related to enjoyment of sensual pleasures, sexual thought [kāmavitakka]|; he abandons it, dispels it, puts an end to it, and obliterates it. He does not tolerate an arisen |thought of ill will::intentional thought of mental rejection, hostility, or malevolence toward others; deliberate contemplation rooted in antipathy or wishing harm [byāpādavitakka]|; he abandons it, dispels it, puts an end to it, and obliterates it. He does not tolerate an arisen |thought of harming::thought of cruelty, violence, or aggression [vihiṃsāvitakka]|; he abandons it, dispels it, puts an end to it, and obliterates it. He does not tolerate any arisen unwholesome state; he abandons it, dispels it, puts an end to it, and obliterates it. This, bhikkhus, is called striving to abandon.

3.) And what, bhikkhus, is striving to cultivate? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]|, which is |supported by seclusion::dependent on detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, and |culminating in complete relinquishment::ripens in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|. He cultivates the |awakening factor of investigation of states::the quality of discriminative investigation into states, mental qualities and other phenomena; analyzing the teaching as a factor of enlightenment; second of the seven awakening factors [dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of energy::the quality of unrelenting effort, the sustaining power of persistence as a factor of enlightenment; third of the seven awakening factors [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of joy::the quality of heartfelt gladness, spiritual rapture untainted by sensuality, as a factor of enlightenment; fourth of the seven awakening factors [pītisambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of collectedness::the quality of unification, stability, and deep stillness of the mind, as a factor of enlightenment; sixth of the seven awakening factors [samādhisambojjhaṅga]|, and the |awakening factor of equanimity::the quality of balanced observation, non-reactivity, and mental equipoise as a factor of enlightenment; seventh of the seven awakening factors [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminating in complete relinquishment. This, bhikkhus, is called striving to cultivate.

4.) And what, bhikkhus, is striving to protect? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu protects an arisen excellent |object of collectedness::theme of mental stillness [samādhinimitta]|: the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a worm infested corpse, the perception of a livid corpse, the perception of a dismembered corpse, the perception of a bloated corpse. This, bhikkhus, is called striving to protect.

These, bhikkhus, are the four right strivings.

Restraint and abandonment,
cultivation and protection;
These four strivings were taught,
by the |kinsman of the Sun::an epithet of the Buddha; lit. relative of the sun [ādiccabandhunā]|;
By these means, a bhikkhu |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|,
arrives to the end of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”
