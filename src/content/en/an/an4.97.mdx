Discourse on Quick To Attend To

Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

1. One who is practicing for one’s own benefit, not for the benefit of others,
2. One who is practicing for the benefit of others, not for one’s own benefit,
3. One who is practicing neither for one’s own benefit nor for the benefit of others,
4. One who is practicing both for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person practice for one’s own benefit, but not for the benefit of others? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is quick to attend to skillful mental qualities, who remembers learned teachings, who investigates the implications of teachings, practicing the teachings properly; yet, he is not articulate in beneficial speech nor skilled in friendly and clear communication, and does not show, encourage, inspire, or applaud his fellow spiritual companions. Thus, bhikkhus, a person practices for one’s own benefit, not for the benefit of others.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person practice for the benefit of others, not for one’s own benefit? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is not quick to attend to skillful mental qualities, nor does he remember learned teachings, nor does he investigate the implications of teachings, nor practices the teachings properly; but he is articulate in beneficial speech, skilled in friendly and clear communication, and shows, encourages, inspires, and applauds his fellow spiritual companions. Thus, bhikkhus, a person practices for the benefit of others, not for one’s own benefit.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person practice neither for one’s own benefit nor for the benefit of others? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is neither quick to attend to skillful mental qualities, nor remembers learned teachings, nor investigates the implications of teachings, nor practices the teachings properly; nor is he articulate in beneficial speech, skilled in friendly and clear communication, and does not show, encourage, inspire, or applaud his spiritual companions. Thus, bhikkhus, a person practices neither for one’s own benefit nor for the benefit of others.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person practice both for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is quick to attend to skillful mental qualities, remembers learned teachings, investigates the implications of teachings, practicing the teachings properly; and he is articulate in beneficial speech, skilled in friendly and clear communication, and shows, encourages, inspires, and applauds his fellow spiritual companions. Thus, bhikkhus, a person practices both for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.
