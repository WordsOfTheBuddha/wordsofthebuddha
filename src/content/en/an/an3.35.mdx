Thus have I heard—At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at |Āḷavi::name of a town and the surrounding country where the Buddha often stayed and taught. Geographically, Āḷavi was located between Sāvatthi and Vesāli [āḷavī]|, on a heap of leaves spread out on a cow track in a |Simsapa::Dalbergia tree; Indian Rosewood [siṃsapā]| grove.

Then, Hatthaka of Āḷavi, while walking and wandering about, saw the Blessed One seated on a spread of leaves on a cow track in the Simsapa grove. Seeing him, he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. As he sat there, Hatthaka of Āḷavi said to the Blessed One: “I hope, venerable sir, that the Blessed One slept comfortably?”

“Yes, young man, I slept comfortably. Among those in the world who sleep comfortably, I am one of them.”

“But, venerable sir, the winter nights are |cold::chilly [sīta]|; it is |midwinter::coldest part of the winter; lit. between the eights [antaraṭṭhaka]|, the time of snowfall. The ground, trampled by the hooves of cattle, is rough; the spread of leaves is thin; few are the leaves on the trees, your ochre robes are light; and a chilly wind is blowing. Yet, the Blessed One says: ‘Yes, young man, I slept comfortably. Among those in the world who sleep comfortably, I am one of them.’”

“Well then, young man, I will ask you a question. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, young man? A householder or a householder’s son might have a |mansion::building with the peaked roof [kūṭāgāra]|, plastered and painted, sheltered from the wind, with well-fitted doors and shuttered windows. There he might have a couch spread with rugs of long fleece, white wool, and patterned covers, with embroidered flowered cloths, spread with choice antelope hides, with a canopy above and red cushions at both ends. An oil lamp would be burning and his four wives would serve him in most agreeable ways. What do you think, young man, would he sleep comfortably or not? What is your view about this?”

“Venerable sir, that man would sleep comfortably. Among those in the world who sleep comfortably, he would be one of them.”

“What do you think, young man? Might there arise in that householder or householder’s son bodily or mental fevers |born of lust::produced by desire, passion [rāgajā]|—by which, being burned by those fevers born of lust, he would sleep with discomfort?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“There might arise in that householder or householder’s son fevers born of lust—by which, being burned by those fevers, he would sleep with discomfort. But the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| has abandoned such |lust::passion, infatuation, desire [rāga]|, |cut it off at the root::eradicated at the source [ucchinnamūla]|, made it like a palm stump, utterly obliterated it, and deprived it of the conditions for future arising. Therefore I have slept comfortably.

What do you think, young man? Might there arise in that householder or householder’s son bodily or mental fevers |born of aversion::born from hatred, produced by ill will [dosajā]|, or bodily or mental fevers |born of delusion::produced from illusion [mohajā]|—by which, being burned by those fevers born of aversion or delusion, he would sleep with discomfort?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“There might arise in that householder or householder’s son fevers born of aversion or delusion—by which, being burned by those fevers, he would sleep with discomfort. But the Tathāgata has abandoned such aversion and delusion, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, utterly obliterated it, and deprived it of the conditions for future arising. Therefore I have slept comfortably.

He ever sleeps with ease,
the sage who has attained |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|;
Sensual pleasures do not |smear::stick to [limpati]| him,
having |become cool::calmed, liberated [sītibhūta]| and |free from attachment::free from grasping, not taking as mine, not appropriating [nirūpadhi]|.

Having cut off every |attachment::clinging, dependence [āsatti]|,
having removed |fear::anguish, dread [dara]| from the |heart::core, kernel [hadaya]|;
|The composed::calmed, tranquil [upasanta]| one sleeps comfortably,
having attained peace of mind.”
