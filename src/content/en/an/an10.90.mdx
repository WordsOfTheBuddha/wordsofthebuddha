Then, Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While Venerable Sāriputta was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said this to him:

"Venerable sir, there are ten strengths of a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, with which a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.' What are the ten?
