Then, Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While Venerable Sāriputta was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said this to him:

"How many, Sāriputta, are the strengths of a bhikkhu who has |exhausted::worn away, slowly destroyed, consumed, ended [khīṇa]| the |taints::outflows, discharges, defilements [āsavā]|, with which a bhikkhu who has exhausted the taints declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The taints are exhausted in me'?"

"Venerable sir, there are ten strengths of a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, with which a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.' What are the ten?

1) Here, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, all |formations::volitional formations, intentions, karmic activity [saṅkhārā]| are seen as |impermanent::unstable, transient, unreliable [anicca]|, rightly, with perfect wisdom. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

2) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, sensual pleasures are seen as a pit of burning coals, rightly, with perfect wisdom. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

3) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, the mind is inclined towards seclusion, leans towards seclusion, slopes towards seclusion, and rests in seclusion, enjoys renunciation, and is entirely freed from all mental qualities that are the source of the defilements. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

4) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, the \{four establishments of mindfulness} (mindfulness of body, feelings, mind, mental qualities [cattāro satipaṭṭhānā] \[Read MN 10](/mn10)) are cultivated and well developed. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

5) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, the four right efforts are cultivated and well developed. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

6) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, the \{four bases of psychic abilities} (the four spiritual powers, the four bases of success [cattāro iddhipādā] \[Read SN 51.20](/sn51.20)) are cultivated and well developed. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

7) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, the \{five faculties} (mental faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom [pañcindriya] \[Read SN 48.10](/sn48.10)) are cultivated and well developed. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

8) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, the five strengths are cultivated and well developed. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

9) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, \{the seven factors of awakening} (the seven factors of enlightenment [satta bojjhaṅgā] \[Read SN 46.32](/sn46.23)) are cultivated and well developed. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

10) Furthermore, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, the noble eightfold path is cultivated and well developed. And even this, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, is a strength, by which strength a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'

These, venerable sir, are the ten strengths of a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements, with which a bhikkhu who has exhausted the defilements declares the exhaustion of the taints: 'The defilements are exhausted in me.'"
