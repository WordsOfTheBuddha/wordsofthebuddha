“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

1.) Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. He |relishes it::takes pleasure in that [tadassādeti]|, |desires::craves, longs for [nikāmeti]| it, and experiences |pleasure::happiness, lit. gain [vitti]| in it. If he remains firm in it, intent upon it, dwelling frequently in it, and if he has not fallen away from that state at the time of death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the |Brahma::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahmā]|’s assembly. The lifespan of the gods of the Brahma’s assembly is an |aeon::lifespan of a world system, a vast cosmic time span [kappa]|. There, an ordinary person, having lived his full lifespan, when that life is exhausted, may go even to hell, to the animal realm, or to the realm of ghosts. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having lived his full lifespan there, when that life is exhausted, attains |final Nibbāna::complete cooling, full quenching, total emancipation, dying one’s final death [parinibbuta]| in that very existence. This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, and the difference between a learned disciple of the Noble Ones and an uninstructed ordinary person, that is, when there is a future |destination::going, passing on, path, course [gati]| and rebirth [that can be pointed out].

2.) Again, bhikkhus, here a certain person, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. He relishes it, desires it, and experiences pleasure in it. If he remains firm in it, intent upon it, dwelling frequently in it, and if he has not fallen away from that state at the time of death, he is reborn in the company of the |gods of Streaming Radiance::MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the second jhāna — the gods of Limited Radiance and the gods of Immeasurable Radiance — should be included, for all these occupy a single level [ābhassara + devā]|. The lifespan of the gods of Streaming Radiance is two aeons. There, an ordinary person, having lived his full lifespan, when that life is exhausted, may go even to hell, to the animal realm, or to the realm of ghosts. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having lived his full lifespan there, when that life is exhausted, attains final Nibbāna in that very existence. This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, and the difference between a learned disciple of the Noble Ones and an uninstructed ordinary person, that is, when there is a future destination and rebirth [that can be pointed out].

3.) Again, bhikkhus, here a certain person, with the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy, the bhikkhu dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ He relishes it, desires it, and experiences pleasure in it. If he remains firm in it, intent upon it, dwelling frequently in it, and if he has not fallen away from that state at the time of death, he is reborn in the company of the |gods of Refulgent Glory::MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the third jhāna — the gods of Limited Glory and the gods of Immeasurable Glory — should be included [subhakiṇha + devā]|. The lifespan of the gods of Refulgent Glory is four aeons. There, an ordinary person, having lived his full lifespan, when that life is exhausted, may go even to hell, to the animal realm, or to the realm of ghosts. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having lived his full lifespan there, when that life is exhausted, attains final Nibbāna in that very existence. This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, and the difference between a learned disciple of the Noble Ones and an uninstructed ordinary person, that is, when there is a future destination and rebirth [that can be pointed out].

4.) Again, bhikkhus, here a certain person, with the abandoning of [bodily] pleasure and |pain::discomfort, unpleasantness. In this context, this is referring to bodily pain or sharp sensations. [dukkha]|, and with the prior settling down of |mental pleasure and displeasure::the duality of positive and negative states of mind; mental happiness and mental pain [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. If he remains firm in it, intent upon it, dwelling frequently in it, and if he has not fallen away from that state at the time of death, he is reborn in the company of the |gods of Great Fruit::These are divinities on the plane of the fourth jhāna [vehapphala + devā]|. The lifespan of the gods of Great Fruit is one hundred aeons. There, an ordinary person, having lived his full lifespan, when that life is exhausted, may go even to hell, to the animal realm, or to the realm of ghosts. But a disciple of the Blessed One, having lived his full lifespan there, when that life is exhausted, attains final Nibbāna in that very existence. This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, and the difference between a learned disciple of the Noble Ones and an uninstructed ordinary person, that is, when there is a future destination and rebirth [that can be pointed out].

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world.”
