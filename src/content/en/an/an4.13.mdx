“Bhikkhus, these are the four right strivings. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu produces |a wholesome motivation::an aspiration, a goal, an interest, an objective [chanda]|, |exerts effort::engages in intentional effort [vāyamati]|, |initiates and sustains energy::the initial spark of motivation and action along with the persistence needed to follow through, even as challenges arise [vīriya + ārabhati]|, |uplifts::befriends and holds it up [paggaṇhāti]| the mind, and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| qualities;

He produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |giving up::letting go, abandoning, removing [pahāna]| of arisen harmful and unwholesome qualities;

He produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |arising::appearance, coming into being [uppāda]| of unarisen |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| qualities;

He produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |stability::establishment, constancy, continuity [ṭhiti]| and |retention::non-confusion and non-decline [asammosa]|, |growth::further development, multiplication [bhiyyobhāva]| and |full development::expansion and maturity [vepulla]| of arisen wholesome qualities.

These, bhikkhus, are the four right strivings.

Those who strive rightly |overcome Māra’s realm::the sphere of temptation and hindrance [māradheyyābhibhūta]|,
they are |detached::untied, free [asita]|, gone beyond the fear of birth and death;
They are |content::fulfilled, satisfied [tusita]| and |unruffled::unperturbed, unmoved [aneja]|, having conquered Māra with his entire army,
having gone beyond all of |Namuci’s::another name for Māra, meaning one who does not let go| forces, they are truly |at ease::blessed, with inner joy of having attained liberation [sukhita]|.”
