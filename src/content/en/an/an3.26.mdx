“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? 1) There is a person who |should not be associated with::should not be followed [na sevitabba]|, |should not be kept company with::should not be friended [na bhajitabba]|, and should not be attended to closely. 2) There is a person who should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be attended to closely. 3) And there is a person who should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be attended to closely with honor and respect.

1) And what kind of person, bhikkhus, should not be associated with, should not be kept company with, and should not be closely attended to? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is |deficient::lacking, inferior [hīna]| in |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]|, |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|, and |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]|. Such a person should not be associated with, should not be kept company with, and should not be closely attended to, except out of |compassion::tender heartedness, kindness [anuddayā]| or |sympathy::benevolence, protectiveness, gentle regard [anukampā]|.

2) And what kind of person, bhikkhus, should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be closely attended to? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is similar in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom. Such a person, bhikkhus, should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be closely attended to. For what reason? [Because one considers:] ‘Since we are similar in virtue, when there is a discussion on virtue, it will continue, and it will be comfortable for us. Since we are similar in collectedness, when there is a discussion on collectedness, it will continue, and it will be comfortable for us. Since we are similar in wisdom, when there is a discussion on wisdom, it will continue, and it will be comfortable for us.’ Therefore, such a person should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be closely attended to.

3) And what kind of person, bhikkhus, should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be closely attended to with honor and respect? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is |excelling::exceeding, distinguished [adhika]| in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom. Such a person, bhikkhus, should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be closely attended to with honor and respect. For what reason? [Because one considers:] ‘In such a way, in the areas where my development of virtue is deficient, it will be brought to fulfillment; and in the areas where my development of virtue is fulfilled, it will be assisted with wisdom in various respects. In the areas where my development of collectedness is deficient, it will be brought to fulfillment; and in the areas where my development of collectedness is fulfilled, it will be assisted with wisdom in various respects. In the areas where my development of wisdom is deficient, it will be brought to fulfillment; and in the areas where my development of wisdom is fulfilled, it will be assisted with wisdom in various respects.’ Therefore, such a person should be associated with, should be kept company with, and should be closely attended to with honor and respect.

These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.”

A person who associates with those who are deficient |declines::deteriorates, is ruined, is destroyed [nihīyati]|,
one who associates with an equal does not diminish;
Associating with the best, one |develops::rises, grows [udeti]| rises,
There one should associate with one |further along than::beyond [uttariṁ]| oneself.
