Bhikkhus, there are six qualities which, if not abandoned, make it impossible to attain and dwell in the first jhāna. Which six? Sensual desire, |ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construct fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]|, |dullness and drowsiness::lack of mental clarity or alertness, mental sluggishness, lethargy, sleepiness lit. stiffness (of mind/body due to tiredness) [thinamiddha]|, |restlessness and worry::agitation and edginess, distraction, fidgeting, fiddling, uneasiness [uddhaccakukkucca]|, |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness wrt suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering [vicikiccha]|, and a failure to clearly see the true danger in sensual pleasures with correct wisdom. These six qualities, if not relinquished, indeed make it impossible to attain and abide in the first jhāna.

Bhikkhus, by abandoning these six qualities one becomes capable of attaining and dwelling in the first jhāna. Which six? Sensual desire, ill will, complacency, restlessness, doubt, and the true perception of the danger in sensual pleasures. By truly understanding and overcoming these hindrances with right wisdom, one becomes capable of entering and remaining in the first jhāna.
