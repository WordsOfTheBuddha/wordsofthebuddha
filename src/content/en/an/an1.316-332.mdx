#### 1.316

“Bhikkhus, one person arises in the world |for the harm of many people::that causes disadvantage, injury, and distress to a large group of people [bahujanāhitāya]| and |for the discomfort of many people::leads to unhappiness, trouble, and affliction for many people [bahujanāsukhāya]|. He arises |for the misfortune::to the detriment [anatthāya]| and |disadvantage::damage [ahitāya]| and |suffering::pain, discomfort, unease, unpleasantness, trouble, stress [dukkha]| of both gods and humans. Who is that one person? He is one with wrong view, |with a distorted view::with inverted perception; lit. completely upside down seeing [viparītadassana]|. He turns many people away from the |True Dhamma::good teaching [saddhamma]| and establishes them in |false Dhamma::false doctrine, unvirtuous practice [asaddhamma]|. This, bhikkhus, is the one person who arises in the world for the harm of many people and for the discomfort of many people; for the misfortune and disadvantage and suffering of both gods and humans.”

#### 1.317

“Bhikkhus, one person arises in the world |for the benefit of many people::that brings well-being, advantage, and good outcomes for many [bahujanahitāya]| and |for the happiness of many people::leads to joy, ease, and comfort for many [bahujanasukhāya]|. He arises |for the sake of::for the purpose of [atthāya]|, for the |benefit of::good of, welfare of [hitāya]|, and for the |ease of::comfort of, contentment of [sukhāya]| both gods and humans. Who is that one person? He is one |with right view::who has right outlook, who has correct understanding of how things have come to be [sammādiṭṭhikā]|, with an undistorted view. He turns many people away from false Dhamma and establishes them in the True Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the one person who arises in the world for the benefit of many people and for the happiness of many people; for the sake of, for the benefit of, and for the ease of both gods and humans.”

#### 1.318

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single other thing that is so very blameworthy as |wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|. Bhikkhus, among things that are very blameworthy, wrong view is the most blameworthy of all.”

#### 1.319

“Bhikkhus, I do not see even a single other person who acts for the harm of many people and for the discomfort of many people; who acts for the misfortune, disadvantage, and suffering of both gods and humans as does |Makkhali::name of a ascetic teacher; Makkhali Gosāla; lit. who carries a bamboo cane [makkhali]|, that |misguided person::vain person [moghapurisa]|. Just as a fishing trap set at the mouth of a river would result in the harm, suffering, misfortune, and disaster of many fish; even so, I think that Makkhali, that misguided person, has arisen in the world as a ‘human-trap’ for the harm, suffering, misfortune, and disaster of many beings.”

#### 1.320

“Bhikkhus, in a |badly expounded::badly taught, badly explained [durakkhāta]| Teaching and Training, both the one who |urges::arouses, encourages; lit. causes to take [samādapeti]| another to practice and the one who is urged, and the one who, having been urged, practices accordingly—all of them produce much |demerit::loss of spiritual wealth [apuñña]|. Why is that? Because the Teaching is badly expounded, bhikkhus.”

#### 1.321

“Bhikkhus, in a |well-expounded::well taught, well explained [svākkhāta]| Teaching and Training, both the one who urges another to practice and the one who is urged, and the one who, having been urged, practices accordingly—all of them produce much merit. Why is that? Because the Teaching is well-expounded, bhikkhus.”

#### 1.322

“Bhikkhus, in a badly expounded Teaching and Training, it is the giver who should know the measure [of giving a gift], not the receiver. Why is that? Because the Teaching is badly expounded, bhikkhus.”

#### 1.323

“Bhikkhus, in a well-expounded Teaching and Training, it is the receiver who should know the measure [of receiving a gift], not the giver. Why is that? Because the Teaching is well-expounded, bhikkhus.”
