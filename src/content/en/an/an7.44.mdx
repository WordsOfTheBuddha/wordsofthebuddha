“Bhikkhus, there are these seven |planes of consciousness::stations of consciousness [viññāṇaṭṭhiti]|. What seven?

1.) Bhikkhus, there are sentient beings with diverse bodies and diverse perceptions, such as humans, certain gods, and some beings in the lower realms. This is the first plane of consciousness.

2.) Bhikkhus, there are sentient beings with diverse bodies but identical perceptions, such as the gods belonging to the |Brahma’s::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahmā]| assembly reborn through the first jhāna. This is the second plane of consciousness.

3.) Bhikkhus, there are sentient beings with identical bodies but diverse perceptions, such as the |radiant gods::a class of gods in the pure abodes [ābhassarā + devā]|. This is the third plane of consciousness.

4.) Bhikkhus, there are sentient beings with identical bodies and identical perceptions, such as the |gods of Refulgent Glory::MA: By mentioning these, all beings occupying the plane of the third jhāna — the gods of Limited Glory and the gods of Immeasurable Glory — should be included [subhakiṇha]|. This is the fourth plane of consciousness.

5.) Bhikkhus, there are sentient beings who, with the complete surpassing of |perceptions of form::recognition of matter, concept of materiality [rūpasaññā]|, with the vanishing of |perceptions of sensory impact::recognition of sense impression, aversion; lit. striking against perception [paṭighasaññā]|, and non-attention to |perceptions of diversity::recognition of diversity, perception of multiplicity [nānattasaññā]|, perceive ‘boundless space.’ They are established in the dimension of boundless space. This is the fifth plane of consciousness.

6.) Bhikkhus, there are sentient beings who, with the complete surpassing of the dimension of boundless space, perceive ‘boundless consciousness.’ They are established in the dimension of boundless consciousness. This is the sixth plane of consciousness.

7.) Bhikkhus, there are sentient beings who, with the complete surpassing of the dimension of boundless consciousness, perceive ‘there is nothing at all.’ They are established in the dimension of nothingness. This is the seventh plane of consciousness.

These, bhikkhus, are the seven planes of consciousness.”
