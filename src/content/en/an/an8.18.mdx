“Bhikkhus, a man binds a woman in eight ways. What eight?

1) A man binds a woman with crying;
2) A man binds a woman with |laughter::smile [hasita]|;
3) A man binds a woman with |talk::speech [bhaṇita]|;
4) A man binds a woman with |deportment::conduct, behavior [ākappa]|;
5) A man binds a woman with a |gift::a present such as flowers or fruits, lit. broken off from the wood [vanabhaṅga]|;
6) A man binds a woman with |scent::fragrance [gandha]|;
7) A man binds a woman with |taste::flavor [rasa]|;
8) A man binds a woman with touch.

These, bhikkhus, are the eight ways in which a man binds a woman. And, bhikkhus, those beings who are bound by touch are thoroughly bound.”
