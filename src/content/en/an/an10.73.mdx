“Bhikkhus, there are these ten things that are wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world. What ten?

1.) |Wealth::possessions, property, riches [bhoga]| is wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world;
2.) |Beauty::good looks [vaṇṇa]| is wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world;
3.) |Health::freedom from disease [ārogya]| is <collapse>wished for, desirable, agreeable, and </collapse>rarely gained in the world;
4.) |Virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]| is <collapse>wished for, desirable, agreeable, and </collapse>rarely gained in the world;
5.) |Spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| is <collapse>wished for, desirable, agreeable, and </collapse>rarely gained in the world;
6.) Friendships are <collapse>wished for, desirable, agreeable, and </collapse>rarely gained in the world;
7.) Having profound knowledge is <collapse>wished for, desirable, agreeable, and </collapse>rarely gained in the world;

9.) Good qualities are <collapse>wished for, desirable, agreeable, and </collapse>rarely gained in the world;
10.) The heavens are wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

There are ten [other] things, bhikkhus, that are obstructions to these ten things that are wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

1.) |Laziness::A mental quality characterized by unwillingness, aversion, or lack of motivation to exert effort in wholesome activities. It reflects an inner resistance to energy and discipline, the seed from which idleness arises. It leads to stagnation, missed opportunities for growth, and failure to cultivate beneficial states. [ālasya]| and |not making effort::inaction, lack of energy to do work [anuṭṭhāna]| are obstructions to the acquisition of wealth;
2.) Not adorning and beautifying oneself are obstructions to beauty;
3.) Doing what is unbeneficial is an obstruction to health;
4.) |Bad friendship::friendship with unwholesome persons [pāpamittatā]| is an obstruction to virtue;
5.) Lack of sense restraint is an obstruction to spiritual life;
6.) |Not keeping one's word::not keeping agreements [visaṁvādana]| is an obstruction to friendships;
7.) Not rehearsing is an obstruction to profound knowledge;
8.) Not wanting to listen and not inquiring are obstructions to wisdom;
9.) |Non-practice::not pursuing [ananuyoga]| and |not reviewing::not reflecting, not contemplating, not thinking about [apaccavekkhaṇā]| are obstructions to good qualities;
10.) Wrong practice is an obstruction to the heavens.

These ten things, bhikkhus, are obstructions to these ten things that are wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

And there are ten [other] things, bhikkhus, that are |nutriments::fuels, nourishments, sustenance [āhārā]| for these ten things that are wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.

1.) Initiative and effort are nutriments for [the acquisition of] wealth;
2.) Adorning and beautifying oneself are nutriments for beauty;
3.) Doing what is beneficial is a nutriment for health;
4.) Good friendship is a nutriment for virtue;
5.) |Sense restraint::guarding the sense faculties [indriyasaṁvara]| is a nutriment for spiritual life;
6.) Not breaking one’s word is a nutriment for friendships;
7.) Rehearsing is a nutriment for profound knowledge;
8.) Wanting to listen and inquiring are nutriments for wisdom;
9.) Practicing and reviewing are nutriments for good qualities;
10.) Right practice is a nutriment for the heavens.

These ten things, bhikkhus, are nutriments for these ten things that are wished for, desirable, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.”
