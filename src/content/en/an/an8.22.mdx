At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjīs at Hatthigāma. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, remember Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma as being endowed with eight wonderful and marvelous qualities.

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Accomplished One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then, a certain bhikkhu, having dressed early in the morning and taking his alms bowl and outer robe, approached the residence of Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma; having approached, he sat down on a prepared seat. Then, Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma approached that bhikkhu; having approached, he paid homage to the bhikkhu and sat down to one side. As Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma was seated to one side, the bhikkhu said to him:

“Householder, the Blessed One declared that you has declared that you are endowed with eight wonderful and marvelous qualities. What are they?”

“Venerable sir, I do not know what eight wonderful and marvelous qualities the Blessed One has declared that I possess. However, there are indeed eight wonderful and marvelous qualities found in me. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, householder,” the bhikkhu replied to Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma. Then Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma spoke thus:

1 “Venerable sir, while I was walking around in the Nāga forest, I saw the Blessed One from afar; just at the very sight of him, venerable sir, my mind became inspired with confidence, and my |tipsiness::intoxication| vanished. This, venerable sir, is the first wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

2 With a confident mind, I attended upon the Blessed One. The Blessed One gradually gave me a discourse, first on giving, then on virtue, and then on the heavens. He explained the dangers, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that my mind was ready, receptive, free of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he then expounded to me the distinctive teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth with no dark spots would perfectly absorb dye, so too, as I was sitting there, the stainless, immaculate Dhamma eye arose in me: ‘Whatever is subject to arising, is subject to cessation.’ Venerable sir, I then became one who has seen the Dhamma, who has attained the Dhamma, who has understood the Dhamma, who has deeply penetrated the Dhamma, having crossed beyond doubt, with no more uncertainty, confident and self-assured, and independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. Right there, I went for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and I undertook the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. This, venerable sir, is the second wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

3 Venerable sir, I had four young wives. Then, venerable sir, I approached them and said: ‘Sisters, I have undertaken the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. Whoever wishes may stay here and enjoy the wealth and perform meritorious deeds, or you may return to your own family. Or if there is another man you prefer, I will give you to him.’ When I said this, venerable sir, my eldest wife replied: ‘Give me to such and such a man, dear husband.’ So, venerable sir, I called that man, and with my left hand, I gave my wife to him, and with my right hand, I presented him with a ceremonial offering. Yet, venerable sir, even while parting with my young wife, I did not notice any alteration in my mind. This, venerable sir, is the third wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

4 Venerable sir, there is wealth in my family, and it is not withheld from virtuous and good people. This, venerable sir, is the fourth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

5 Venerable sir, when I attend upon a bhikkhu, I do so with proper respect, not without respect. If a venerable one teaches me the Dhamma, I listen to it attentively, not carelessly. If he does not teach me the Dhamma, I teach him the Dhamma. This, venerable sir, is the fifth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

6 Venerable sir, it is not unusual that when the Sangha is invited, deities come to me and announce: ‘Such and such a bhikkhu is liberated in both ways, such and such is liberated by wisdom, such and such is a body-witness, such and such has attained through view, such and such is liberated by confidence, such and such is a follower of the Dhamma, such and such is a follower of faith, such and such is virtuous and has good qualities, such and such is immoral and has bad qualities.’ However, venerable sir, when I serve the Sangha, I do not notice myself arousing the thought: ‘I will give more to this one, less to that one.’ Instead, venerable sir, I give with an impartial mind. This, venerable sir, is the sixth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

7 It is not unusual for deities to come to me and announce: ‘The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, householder.’ When this is said, venerable sir, I reply to those deities: ‘Whether you deities say this or not, the Dhamma is indeed well-expounded by the Blessed One. However, venerable sir, I do not perceive any elation of mind because of this, thinking: ‘Deities approach me, and I converse with them.’ This, venerable sir, is the seventh wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

8 Furthermore, Venerable sir, if I were to pass away before the Blessed One, it would not be surprising if the Blessed One were to declare of me: ‘There is no fetter by which Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma is bound that would bring him back to this world again.’ This, venerable sir, is the eighth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

These, venerable sir, are the eight wonderful and marvelous qualities that are found in me. However, I do not know which eight wonderful and marvelous qualities the Blessed One declared that I am endowed with.

Then the bhikkhu, after taking alms food from the house of Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma, rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, the bhikkhu, having completed his alms round, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the bhikkhu reported to the Blessed One all of his conversation with Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma.

The Blessed One said, “Good, good, bhikkhu. Just as Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma rightly explained, in the same way, I declare that he is endowed with these eight wonderful and marvelous qualities. Bhikkhu, remember Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma as being endowed with these eight wonderful and marvelous qualities.”
