"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, one person gains internal tranquility of mind but does not gain insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

Here, bhikkhus, another person gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom but does not gain internal tranquility of mind.

Here, bhikkhus, another person neither gains internal tranquility of mind nor gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

And then there is a person who gains both internal tranquility of mind and gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

In this case, bhikkhus, when a person gains internal tranquility of mind but does not gain insight into phenomena through higher wisdom, that person, relying on internal tranquility of mind, should make an effort for insight into phenomena through higher wisdom. In this way, in due course, that person gains both internal tranquility of mind and insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

Similarly, bhikkhus, when a person gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom but does not gain internal tranquility of mind, that person, relying on insight into phenomena through higher wisdom, should make an effort for internal tranquility of mind. In this way, in due course, that person gains both insight into phenomena through higher wisdom and internal tranquility of mind.

Similarly, bhikkhus, when a person neither gains internal tranquility of mind nor insight into phenomena through higher wisdom, that person should develop a strong desire, effort, persistence, and determination to acquire those wholesome qualities. Just as, bhikkhus, a man whose clothes or head are ablaze would make a strong effort, persistence, and determination to extinguish the fire, so too, bhikkhus, should that person develop a strong desire, effort, persistence, and determination to acquire those wholesome qualities. In this way, in due course, that person gains both internal tranquility of mind and insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

Finally, bhikkhus, when a person gains both internal tranquility of mind and insight into phenomena through higher wisdom, that person, relying on those wholesome qualities, should strive further for the ending of the |defilements::discharge from a sore, taints|.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."
