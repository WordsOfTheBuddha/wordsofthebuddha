“These seven |perceptions::conceptions, recognitions [saññā]|, when cultivated and frequently practiced, are of great fruit and great benefit; they lead to the deathless and |culminate in the deathless::end in the deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amatapariyosāna]|.

What seven? 1.) The perception of |unattractiveness::disagreeableness, recognizing the not aesthetically pleasing characteristics [asubha]|, 2.) the perception of death, 3.) the perception of unpleasantness of food, 4.) the perception of non-delight in the whole world, 5.) the perception of |impermanence::instability [anicca]|, 6.) the perception of |unsatisfactoriness::having the quality of being distressing, unfulfilling, marked by discontentment [dukkha]| in impermanence, and 7.) the perception of |not-self::essenceless, not suitable to identify with [anatta]| in unsatisfactoriness. These, bhikkhus, are the seven perceptions which, when cultivated and frequently practiced, are of great fruit and great benefit; they lead to the deathless and culminate in the deathless.”
