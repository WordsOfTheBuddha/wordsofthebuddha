“Bhikkhus, a giver, giving food, gives five things to the recipients. What five? They give life, beauty, happiness, strength, and |eloquence::intelligence, wit, ingenuity [paṭibhāna]|.

Having given life, the giver becomes a |partaker::shareholder [bhāgī]| of life, be it |divine::heavenly, celestial [dibba]| or human;

Having given beauty, the giver becomes a partaker of beauty, be it divine or human;

Having given happiness, the giver becomes a partaker of happiness, be it divine or human;

Having given strength, the giver becomes a partaker of strength, be it divine or human;

Having given eloquence, the giver becomes a partaker of eloquence, be it divine or human.

Thus, bhikkhus, a giver, giving food, gives these five things to the recipients.

The wise one who gives life, strength,
beauty and eloquence;
The |discerning one::who has good judgement [medhāvī]|, a giver of happiness,
finds happiness [as a result].

Having given life, strength, beauty,
happiness and eloquence;
Such a one becomes long-lived and famous,
wherever they are reborn.”
