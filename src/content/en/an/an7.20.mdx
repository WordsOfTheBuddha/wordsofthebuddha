“Bhikkhus, there are these seven grounds for inclination. What seven?

1.) Here, a bhikkhu has keen aspiration for undertaking the training precepts, and in the future too, his fondness for undertaking the training precepts does not diminish.

2.) He has keen aspiration for attending carefully to the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, and in the future too, his fondness for attending carefully to the Dhamma does not diminish.

3.) He has keen aspiration for the |removal of longing::dispelling of wanting [icchāvinaya]|, and in the future too, his fondness for the removal of longing does not diminish.

4.) He has keen aspiration for |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, and in the future too, his fondness for seclusion does not diminish.

5.) He has keen aspiration for |arousing energy::taking initiative, making a mental decision to act [vīriyārambha]|, and in the future too, his fondness for arousing energy does not diminish.

6.) He has keen aspiration for |skilled mindfulness::maintaining awareness of the present moment and understanding things clearly [satinepakka]|, and in the future too, his fondness for skilled mindfulness does not diminish.

7.) He has keen aspiration for the |realization of right view::direct experiential understanding of the Four Noble Truths and the nature of reality, developed through learning, reflection, and practice in accordance with the Dhamma [diṭṭhipaṭivedha]|, and in the future too, his fondness for the realization of right view does not diminish.

These, bhikkhus, are the seven grounds for inclination.”
