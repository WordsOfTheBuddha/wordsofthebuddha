“Bhikkhus, these are the four things. What four? There are, bhikkhus, things that should be fully comprehended by directly knowing; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be abandoned by directly knowing; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be developed by directly knowing; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be personally realized by directly knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be fully comprehended by directly knowing? The five aggregates subject to clinging — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be fully comprehended by directly knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be abandoned by directly knowing? |Ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]| and craving for |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]| — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be abandoned by directly knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be developed by directly knowing? Tranquility and insight — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be developed by directly knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be personally realized by directly knowing? Wisdom and liberation — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be realized by directly knowing.

These, indeed, bhikkhus, are the four things.”
