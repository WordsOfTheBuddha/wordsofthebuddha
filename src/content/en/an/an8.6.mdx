"Bhikkhus, there are these eight worldly conditions that revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight? |Gain::acquisition, money, profit, possessions [lābha]| and |loss::not getting, not obtaining, not finding [alābha]|, |fame::glory, prestige [yasa]| and |disgrace::loss of reputation, infamy [ayasa]|, |blame::criticism, disapproval [nindā]| and |praise::commendation, approval [pasaṃsā]|, and |pleasure::ease, comfort, happiness, contentment [sukha]| and |pain::unease, discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment [dukkha]|. These, bhikkhus, are the eight worldly conditions that revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.

Bhikkhus, for an uninstructed ordinary person, gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain arise. Similarly, for an learned disciple of the noble ones, gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain arise. In this case, bhikkhus, what is the distinction, the disparity, and the difference between an uninstructed ordinary person and an learned disciple of the noble ones?"

"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, and have the Blessed One as their refuge. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One himself would clarify the meaning of this statement."

"Then listen, bhikkhus, and pay close attention, I will speak."

"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, for an uninstructed ordinary person, gain arises. They do not reflect: 'This gain that has arisen is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change.' They do not understand it |as it truly is::as it has come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|. Loss arises ... fame arises ... disgrace arises ... blame arises ... praise arises ... pleasure arises ... pain arises. They do not reflect: 'This pain that has arisen is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change.' They do not understand it as it truly is.

For such a person, gain |occupies::obsesses, controls [pariyādāya]| their mind and remains, loss occupies their mind and remains, fame occupies their mind and remains, disgrace occupies their mind and remains, blame occupies their mind and remains, praise occupies their mind and remains, pleasure occupies their mind and remains, and pain occupies their mind and remains. They |delight in::approve of [anurujjhati]| gain when it arises and |resist::are hostile to [paṭivirujjhati]| loss. They delight in fame when it arises and resist disgrace. They delight in praise when it arises and resist blame. They delight in pleasure when it arises and resist pain. Thus, being entangled in delight and resistance, they are not freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. They are not freed from suffering, I say.

Bhikkhus, for an learned disciple of the noble ones, gain arises. They reflect: 'This gain that has arisen is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change.' They understand it as it truly is. Loss arises ... fame arises ... disgrace arises ... blame arises ... praise arises ... pleasure arises ... pain arises. They reflect: 'This pain that has arisen is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change.' They understand it as it truly is.

For such a person, gain does not occupy their mind and remain, loss does not occupy their mind and remain, fame does not occupy their mind and remain, disgrace does not occupy their mind and remain, blame does not occupy their mind and remain, praise does not occupy their mind and remain, pleasure does not occupy their mind and remain, and pain does not occupy their mind and remain. They do not delight in gain when it arises and do not resist loss. They do not delight in fame when it arises and do not resist disgrace. They do not delight in praise when it arises and do not resist blame. They do not delight in pleasure when it arises and do not resist pain. Thus, not being entangled in delight and resistance, they are freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. They are freed from suffering, I say."

### Verse

"Gain and loss, fame and disgrace,
blame and praise, and pleasure and pain;
These conditions among humans are |impermanent::not lasting, transient, unreliable [anicca]|,
|unstable::perishable [asassata]| and subject to change.

A |mindful::who has recollection, is aware, present [satimant]| and |discerning::wise [sumedha]| person, having understood these conditions, 
sees them as being subject to change;
|Favorable::pleasing, likeable, cherished [iṭṭha]| conditions do not |stir::agitate, disturb, or excite [matheti]| their mind,
and unfavorable conditions cause no |repulsion::resistance [paṭighātameti]|.

They have dispelled |alignment::favor [anurodha]| and |opposition::aversion, resistance, hostility [virodha]|,
these are gone and no longer present;
Having understood the |unblemished::pure, stainless [viraja]|, sorrowless state,
they comprehend rightly, having crossed beyond |becoming::state of existence, rebirth [bhava]|."
