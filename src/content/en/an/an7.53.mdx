Thus have I heard—At one time, the venerable |Sāriputta::foremost disciple of the Buddha in great wisdom [sāriputta]| and the venerable |Mahāmoggallāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in psychic power; lit. Moggallāna the great [mahāmoggallāna]| were on a journey in the Dakkhināgiri region together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. At that time, Nandamātā, the female lay disciple from Veḷukaṇḍaka, having woken up before dawn in the night, melodiously chanted the |Way to the Far Shore [SnP 5]::last chapter of the Sutta Nipāta; lit. going beyond. Browse its discourses over [here](/snp5) [pārāyana]|.

Now at that time, the |great king Vessavaṇa::name of one of the four great kings, a deity; lit. famous [vessavaṇa]| was traveling from the northern direction to the southern direction for some |duty::obligation, business, something to be done [karaṇīya]|. The great king Vessavaṇa heard Nandamātā, the female lay disciple, melodiously chanting the Way to the Far Shore. Having heard it, he remained, waiting for the chanting to end.

Then, Nandamātā, the female lay disciple, having melodiously chanted the Way to the Far Shore, became silent. Then, the great king Vessavaṇa, understanding that Nandamātā had finished her chanting, expressed approval, saying, “Well done, |sister::respectful address to a woman [bhaginī]|, well done, sister!”

“Who are you, |gracious one::fortunate one, my dear [bhadramukha]|?”

“Sister, I am your brother, Vessavaṇa, the great king.”

“Excellent, gracious one. In that case, may this teaching of mine that has been spoken be a gift of offering to you.”

“Excellent, sister. May this too be a gift of offering to me. Tomorrow, the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, will arrive to Veḷukaṇḍaka without having eaten. After serving that Saṅgha of bhikkhus, you should offer the merit to me. This too could be your gift of offering to me.”

Then, after the passage of that night, Nandamātā, the female lay disciple, had various kinds of excellent food prepared in her own residence. Then, the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, without having had their meal, arrived at Veḷukaṇḍaka. Then, Nandamātā, the female lay disciple, addressed a certain man, saying, “Come, sir. Go to the |park::monastery [ārāma]| and announce to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus: ‘It is time, venerable sirs, the meal is ready at the residence of the lady Nandamātā.’”

“Yes, lady,” having acknowledged to Nandamātā, the female lay disciple, he went to the park and announced to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, “It is time, venerable sirs, the meal is ready at the residence of the lady Nandamātā.”

Then, the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, having dressed early in the morning, taking their alms bowl and outer robe, approached the residence of Nandamātā, the female lay disciple; having approached, they sat down on the seats that had been prepared. Then, Nandamātā, the female lay disciple, with her own hands, served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, with the various kinds of excellent food.

Then, Nandamātā, the female lay disciple, sat down to one side after the venerable Sāriputta had finished his meal and put away his bowl. When she was seated to one side, the venerable Sāriputta said to her: “But who, Nandamātā, announced to you that the Saṅgha of bhikkhus was coming?”

“Here, venerable sir, I woke up before dawn in the night and, having melodiously chanted the Way to the Far Shore, I became silent. Then, venerable sir, the great king Vessavaṇa, understanding that I had finished my chanting, expressed approval, saying, ‘Well done, sister, well done, sister!'

'Who are you, gracious one?'

'Sister, I am your brother, Vessavaṇa, the great king.’

'Excellent, gracious one. In that case, may this teaching of mine that has been spoken be a gift of offering to you.’

'Excellent, sister. May this too be a gift of offering to me. Tomorrow, the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, will arrive to Veḷukaṇḍaka without having eaten. After serving that Saṅgha of bhikkhus, you should offer the merit to me. This too could be your gift of offering to me.’

Venerable sir, may the merit from this giving and the great merit that arises be for the |happiness::ease, comfort, contentedness [sukhāya]| of the great king Vessavaṇa.

“Wonderful, Nandamātā, marvelous, Nandamātā! How remarkable it is that you converse face to face with the great king Vessavaṇa, the deity endowed with such great power and influence.”

“Venerable sir, that is not the only wonderful and marvelous quality of mine. I have another wonderful and marvelous quality. Here, venerable sir, I had an only son named Nanda, who was dear and pleasing to me. The rulers, for some reason, took him away by force and executed him. Yet, venerable sir, when my boy was taken away or when he was being taken away, when he was punished or being punished, when he was killed or being killed, I do not recall any alteration in my mind.”

“Wonderful, Nandamātā, marvelous, Nandamātā! How remarkable it is that you can purify even the arising of thoughts.”

“Venerable sir, that is not the only wonderful and marvelous quality of mine. I have another wonderful and marvelous quality. Here, venerable sir, my husband passed away and was reborn as a certain |native spirit::a spirit that may be protective or malevolent, a daemon, or a supernatural being [yakkha]|. He appeared to me in that same previous form. Yet, venerable sir, I do not recall any alteration in my mind because of that.”

“Wonderful, Nandamātā, marvelous, Nandamātā! How remarkable it is that you can purify even the arising of thoughts.”

“Venerable sir, that is not the only wonderful and marvelous quality of mine. I have another wonderful and marvelous quality. Since I was brought to my husband when we were both young, I do not recall ever transgressing against him even in thought, let alone in body.”

“Wonderful, Nandamātā, marvelous, Nandamātā! How remarkable it is that you can purify even the arising of thoughts.”

“Venerable sir, that is not the only wonderful and marvelous quality of mine. I have another wonderful and marvelous quality. Since I was established as a female lay disciple, I do not recall ever intentionally violating any of the training rules.”

“Wonderful, Nandamātā, marvelous, Nandamātā!”

“Venerable sir, that is not the only wonderful and marvelous quality of mine. I have another wonderful and marvelous quality. Here, venerable sir, as long as I wish, I can enter and dwell in the first jhāna, having secluded myself from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and |imbued with joyful pleasure::imbued with joy and happiness, with delight and ease, sometimes experienced as an intense joy or pleasure, rapture [pītisukha]|. With the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, experiencing internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with joyful pleasure, I can enter and dwell in the second jhāna. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, I dwell |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, equanimous, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body, which the Noble Ones describe as ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ Thus, I can enter and dwell in the third jhāna. With the abandonment of pleasure and |discontentment::discomfort, unpleasantness, something unsatisfactory, stress [dukkha]|, and with the settling down of |joy and sorrow::craving and aversion, pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, gladness and dejection, positive state of mind and negative state of mind [somanassadomanassa]|, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant, I can enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna.”

“Wonderful, Nandamātā, marvelous, Nandamātā!”

“Venerable sir, that is not the only wonderful and marvelous quality of mine. I have another wonderful and marvelous quality. Of the five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I do not see any that have |not been abandoned::not been given up, not been removed [appahīna]| by me.”

“Wonderful, Nandamātā, marvelous, Nandamātā!”

“Then the venerable Sāriputta instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Nandamātā with a discourse on the Dhamma. After that, he rose from his seat and departed.”
