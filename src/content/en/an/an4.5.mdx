"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four? The one who goes with the current, the one who goes against the current, the one who is steady, and the one who has crossed over, standing on the firm ground, a |brāhmin::an arahant|.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person who goes with the current? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person engages in sensual pleasures and performs unwholesome actions. This is called the person who goes with the current.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person who goes against the current? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not indulge in sensual pleasures and does not perform unwholesome actions. Even with suffering, sorrow, tearful face, and crying, they live a fully pure spiritual life. This is called the person who goes against the current.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person who is steady? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, with the complete wearing away of the five lower fetters, becomes spontaneously reborn and there attains final Nibbāna, not subject to returning from that world. This is called the person who is steady.

And what, bhikkhus, is the person who has crossed over, standing on the shore, an awakened one? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, through the complete wearing away of the mental defilements, has attained the taint-free release of mind and release by wisdom, having realized it by |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]| in this very life, and dwells having attained it. This is called the person who has crossed over, standing on the shore, a brāhmin.

There are, bhikkhus, these four kinds of persons found existing in the world.

### Verse

Whoever are unrestrained in |sensual pleasures::sense desires, wishing, wanting, delighting in [kāma]|,
not free from |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|, enjoying sensual pleasures here;
They go again and again to birth and aging,
overcome by |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|, they go with the current.

Therefore, a wise person established in mindfulness here,
not engaging in sensual pleasures and |injurious actions::harmful, bad, potentially evil intention or action [pāpa]|;
Should abandon sensual pleasures even if it's painful,
They call such a person one who goes against the current.

Whoever has abandoned the five |unwholesome mental states::mental defilements, impurities of mind [kilesa]\n\nHere, it is a reference to the five hindrances of doubt regarding Dhamma, sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, and restlessness and worry|,
perfected in training and not subject to decline,
Attained mastery of the mind and with composed faculties,
They indeed are called a |steady person::who is stable, self-controlled [ṭhitatta]|.

One who has comprehended things subtle and gross,
|dispelled::dispersed [vidhūpita]| them up, so they're gone and exist no more;
They indeed are a sage, having fulfilled the spiritual life,
and reached the world's end, they are called 'one who has gone beyond.''"
