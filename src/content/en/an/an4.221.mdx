"Bhikkhus, these are the four misconducts by way of speech. What are the four? False speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter — these are the four misconducts by way of speech.

Bhikkhus, these are the four good conducts by way of speech. What are the four? Truthful speech, speech that is not |divisive::promoting harmony|, gentle speech, and thoughtful speech — these are the four good conducts by way of speech."
