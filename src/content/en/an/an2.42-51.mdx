“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The shallow assembly and the deep assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the shallow assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus are |restless::agitated, unbalanced, confused about what is right and wrong [uddhata]|, |arrogant::conceited, haughty [unnaḷa]|, |unsteady::wavering, fickle, inconsistent [capala]|, |talkative::big-mouthed [mukhara]|, |rambling in speech::chatty, with scattered speech [vikiṇṇavāca]|, |muddle-minded::forgetful, not mindful [muṭṭhassatī]|, |lacking clear awareness::inattentive [asampajāna]|, |distracted::with scattered attention, not collected, not well-composed [asamāhita]|, |with a wandering mind::with runaway thoughts, mentally out of control [vibbhantacitta]| and |with unrestrained faculties::with uncontrolled senses bases, having a vulgar mind [pākatindriya]| is called the shallow assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the deep assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus are not restless, not arrogant, |steady::steadfast, reliable [acapala]|, not talkative, not rambling in speech, |attending mindfully::with presence of mind [upaṭṭhitassatī]|, fully aware, |collected::composed, settled [samāhita]|, |with a unified mind::with a one-pointed mind; with an integrated, well-composed, concentrated mind [ekaggacitta]| and with restrained faculties is called the deep assembly. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the deep assembly is the foremost.”

#### 2.43

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The factious assembly and the |unified::harmonious [samagga]| assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the factious assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus take to |blaming::accusing, conflicting [bhaṇḍanajāta]|, |quarreling::disputing [kalahajāta]|, engage in arguing, and stab each other with pointed words is called the factious assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the unified assembly? The assembly in which the bhikkhus dwell in concord, being friendly, not disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with eyes of affection is called the unified assembly. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the unified assembly is the foremost.”

#### 2.44

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The inferior assembly and the excellent assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the inferior assembly? It is the assembly in which the elder bhikkhus are |indulgent::excessive, living luxuriously, extravagant [bāhulika]| and |careless::loose, lethargic, lax [sāthalika]|, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion; they do not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [Those in] the next generation follow their example. They too become indulgent and careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion; they too do not arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is called the inferior assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the excellent assembly? It is the assembly in which the elder bhikkhus are not indulgent or careless, they are not leaders in backsliding, and foremost in seclusion; they arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. [Those in] the next generation follow their example. They too are not indulgent or careless, they are not leaders in backsliding, and they are foremost in seclusion; they too arouse energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized. This is called the excellent assembly. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the excellent assembly is the foremost.”

#### 2.45

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The assembly of the ignoble and the assembly of the noble.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly of the ignoble? The assembly in which the bhikkhus do not understand |as it is in actuality::as it has come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|: ‘This is suffering;’ do not understand at it is in actuality: ‘this is the arising of suffering;’ do not understand at it is in actuality: ‘this is the end of suffering;’ do not understand at it is in actuality: ‘this is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering’ is called the assembly of the ignoble.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly of the noble? The assembly in which the bhikkhus understand as it is in actuality: ‘This is suffering;’ understand as it is in actuality: ‘this is the arising of suffering;’ understand as it is in actuality: ‘this is the end of suffering;’ understand as it is in actuality: ‘this is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering’ is called the assembly of the noble. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the assembly of the noble is the foremost.”

#### 2.46

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The assembly of the |dregs::refuse [kasaṭa]| and the assembly of the |cream::best part [maṇḍa]|.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly of the dregs? The assembly in which the bhikkhus take an incorrect course of action due to |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]|, |aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, |delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|, or |fear::panic, scare, dread, terror [bhaya]| is called the assembly of the dregs.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly of the cream? The assembly in which the bhikkhus do not take an incorrect course of action due to desire, aversion, delusion, or fear is called the assembly of the cream. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the assembly of the cream is the foremost.”

#### 2.47

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The assembly trained in |empty talk::vain talk, bragging [okkācita]| but not trained in questioning, and the assembly trained in questioning but not trained in empty talk.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly trained in empty talk but not trained in questioning? Here, in this kind of assembly, when those discourses spoken by the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| are being mentioned that are deep, profound in implication, |world-transcending::supra-mundane [lokuttara]|, |connected with emptiness::regarding non-subjectivity [suññatāpaṭisaṁyutta]|, the bhikkhus do not want to listen to them, do not lend an ear to them, or apply their minds to understand them; they do not think those teachings should be studied and learned. But when those discourses are being spoken that are mere poetry composed by poets, beautiful in words and phrases, ornate in expression, created by outsiders, spoken by disciples, then they do want to listen, lend an ear, and apply their minds to understand them, and they regard those teachings as worth studying and learning. Having learned them, they do not question one another or examine them thoroughly, [asking]: ‘How is this? What does this mean?’ They do not reveal what is unexplained or clarify what is obscure, and in regard to the many matters that arouse |doubt::uncertainty, perplexity, hesitation—especially in relation to faith, truth, or decision-making on the path [kaṅkhā]|, they do not dispel their doubts. This is called the assembly trained in empty talk but not trained in questioning.

Here, in this kind of assembly, when discourses that are mere poetry composed by poets, beautiful in words and phrases, ornate in expression, composed by outsiders, spoken by disciples, are being spoken, the bhikkhus do not want to listen to them, do not lend an ear to them, or apply their minds to understand them; they do not think those teachings should be studied and learned. But when those discourses spoken by the Tathāgata are being mentioned that are deep, profound in implication, world-transcending, connected with emptiness, they do want to listen, lend an ear, and apply their minds to understand them, and they regard those teachings as worth studying and learning. Having learned them, they question one another and examine them thoroughly, [asking]: ‘How is this? What is the meaning of this?’ They reveal what is unexplained and clarify what is obscure, and with regard to the many matters that arouse doubt, they dispel their doubts. This is called the assembly trained in questioning but not trained in empty talk. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the assembly trained in questioning but not trained in empty talk is the foremost.”

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The assembly that values |worldly things::material wealth, worldly gain [āmisa]| but not the |true Dhamma::good teaching [saddhamma]|, and the assembly that values the true Dhamma but not worldly things.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly that values worldly things but not the true Dhamma? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus speak one another’s praises in the presence of householders clad in white, saying: ‘Such-and-such a bhikkhu is liberated in both ways, such-and-such is liberated by wisdom, such-and-such is a |body-witness::liberated through the experience of jhāna and formless attainments [kāyasakkhī]|, such-and-such is attained through view, such-and-such is |attained through confidence::liberated through faith; epithet of a stream-enterer or higher [saddhāvimutta]|, such-and-such is a Dhamma follower, such-and-such is |virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]| and |endowed with wholesome qualities::one who has had a long association of wholesome mental qualities - of diligence, aroused energy, having few wishes, rational application of mind, having situational awareness, having good friends, pursuing good habits [kalyāṇadhamma]|, such-and-such is |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]| and |endowed with harmful qualities::one who has had a long association of harmful mental qualities - of negligence, laziness, having many wishes, irrational application of mind, lack of situational awareness, having bad friends, pursuing bad habits [pāpadhamma]|.’ In this way they obtain worldly gains. And having obtained such gains, they enjoy them while being tied to them, infatuated with them, blindly absorbed in them, not seeing the disadvantage of them, and not knowing the escape. This is called the assembly that values worldly things but not the true Dhamma.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly that values the true Dhamma but not worldly things? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus do not speak one another’s praises in the presence of householders clad in white, saying: ‘Such-and-such a bhikkhu is liberated in both ways, such-and-such is liberated by wisdom, such-and-such is a body-witness, such-and-such is attained through view, such-and-such is attained through confidence, such-and-such is a Dhamma follower, such-and-such is virtuous and endowed with wholesome qualities, such-and-such is unprincipled and endowed with harmful qualities.’ Yet in this way too they obtain worldly gains. And having obtained such gains, they enjoy them without being tied to them, without being infatuated with them, without being blindly absorbed in them, seeing the disadvantage of them, and knowing the escape. This is called the assembly that values the true Dhamma but not worldly things. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the assembly that values the true Dhamma but not worldly things is the foremost.”

#### 2.49

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The crooked assembly and the straight assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the crooked assembly? Here, in such an assembly, acts contrary to Dhamma take place while acts in accordance with Dhamma do not take place; acts contrary to |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]| take place while acts in accordance with Vinaya do not take place. Acts contrary to Dhamma shine forth while acts in accordance with Dhamma do not shine forth; acts contrary to Vinaya shine forth while acts in accordance with Vinaya do not shine forth. This is called the crooked assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the straight assembly? Here, in such an assembly, acts in accordance with Dhamma take place while acts contrary to Dhamma do not take place; acts in accordance with Vinaya take place while acts contrary to Vinaya do not take place. Acts in accordance with Dhamma shine forth while acts contrary to Dhamma do not shine forth; acts in accordance with Vinaya shine forth while acts contrary to Vinaya do not shine forth. This is called the straight assembly. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the straight assembly is the foremost.”

#### 2.50

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The unrighteous assembly and the righteous assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the unrighteous assembly? Here, in such an assembly, acts contrary to Dhamma take place while acts in accordance with Dhamma do not take place; acts contrary to |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]| take place while acts in accordance with Vinaya do not take place. Acts contrary to Dhamma shine forth while acts in accordance with Dhamma do not shine forth; acts contrary to Vinaya shine forth while acts in accordance with Vinaya do not shine forth. This is called the unrighteous assembly.

And what, bhikkhus, is the righteous assembly? Here, in such an assembly, acts in accordance with Dhamma take place while acts contrary to Dhamma do not take place; acts in accordance with Vinaya take place while acts contrary to Vinaya do not take place. Acts in accordance with Dhamma shine forth while acts contrary to Dhamma do not shine forth; acts in accordance with Vinaya shine forth while acts contrary to Vinaya do not shine forth. This is called the righteous assembly. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two kinds of assemblies, the righteous assembly is the foremost.”

#### 2.51

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? The assembly that doesn't speak according to the Dhamma and the assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly that doesn't speak according to the Dhamma? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus take up a disciplinary issue, one that may accord with the Dhamma or be contrary to the Dhamma. Having taken up the issue, they do not persuade one another and do not allow themselves to be persuaded; they do not deliberate and do not welcome deliberation. Lacking the power of persuasion and the power of deliberation, unwilling to relinquish their opinion, they stubbornly cling to that disciplinary issue, and, adhering to their position, they declare: ‘This alone is true; anything else is wrong.’ This is called the assembly that doesn't speak according to the Dhamma.

And what, bhikkhus, is the assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma? Here, in this kind of assembly the bhikkhus take up a disciplinary issue, one that may accord with the Dhamma or be contrary to the Dhamma. Having taken up the issue, they persuade one another and allow themselves to be persuaded; they deliberate and welcome deliberation. Possessing the power of persuasion and the power of deliberation, willing to relinquish their opinion, they do not cling to that disciplinary issue, nor, adhering to their position, do they declare: ‘This alone is true; anything else is wrong.’ This is called the assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma. These, bhikkhus, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, the assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma is the foremost.”
