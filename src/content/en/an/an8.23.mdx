At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Āḷavi::name of a town and the surrounding country where the Buddha often stayed and taught. Geographically, Āḷavī was located between Sāvatthi and Vesāli [āḷavī]|, at the Aggāḷava shrine. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, you should remember Hatthaka of Āḷavī as being endowed with seven wonderful and marvelous qualities. What seven? 1) Hatthaka of Āḷavi is endowed with |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|; 2) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]|; 3) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with a |sense of right and wrong::sense of shame, conscience, modesty [hirī]|; 4) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]|; 5) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is |very learned::well educated, knowledgeable [bahussuta]|; 6) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is |generous::open-handed [cāgavant]|; 7) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is |wise::intelligent, discerning, insightful, percipient [paññava]|. It is with these seven wonderful and marvelous qualities, bhikkhus, that you should remember Hatthaka of Āḷavī.”

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Well-Gone One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then, a certain bhikkhu, having dressed early in the morning and taking his alms bowl and outer robe, approached the residence of Hatthaka of Āḷavi; having approached, he sat down on a prepared seat. Then Hatthaka of Āḷavi approached that bhikkhu; having approached, he paid homage to the bhikkhu and sat down to one side. As Hatthaka of Āḷavi was seated to one side, the bhikkhu said to him:

“Friend, the Blessed One declared you as being endowed with seven wonderful and marvelous qualities. What seven? ‘1) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with faith; 2) he is virtuous; 3) has a sense of right and wrong; 4) has fear of wrongdoing; 5) is very learned; 6) is generous; 7) is wise.’ Thus, friend, the Blessed One declared you as being endowed with seven wonderful and marvelous qualities.”

“I hope, venerable sir, that no householder dressed in white was present?”

“No, friend, there was no householder dressed in white present.”

“Good, venerable sir, that no householder dressed in white was present.”

Then the bhikkhu, after taking alms food from the house of Hatthaka of Āḷavi, rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, the bhikkhu, having completed his alms round, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said this to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, earlier this morning, after dressing and taking my bowl and outer robe, I approached the residence of Hatthaka of Āḷavī. Having approached, I sat down on a prepared seat. Then, venerable sir, Hatthaka of Āḷavī came to where I was; having approached, he paid homage to me and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, venerable sir, I said this to Hatthaka of Āḷavī: ‘Friend, the Blessed One declared you as being endowed with seven wonderful and marvelous qualities. What seven? ‘1) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with faith; 2) he is virtuous; 3) has a sense of right and wrong; 4) has fear of wrongdoing; 5) is very learned; 6) is generous; 7) is wise.’ Thus, friend, the Blessed One declared you as being endowed with seven wonderful and marvelous qualities.’”

When this was said, venerable sir, Hatthaka said to me: ‘Venerable sir, I hope that no householder dressed in white was present?’ I replied: ‘No, friend, there was no householder dressed in white present.’ Hatthaka then said: ‘Good, venerable sir, that no householder dressed in white was present.’”

“Good, good, bhikkhu. That |clansman::young gentleman, son of a good family [kulaputta]| is one of few wishes. Even though wholesome qualities are present in himself, he does not wish them to be known by others. Therefore, bhikkhu, you should remember Hatthaka of Āḷavī as being endowed with this additional eighth wonderful and marvelous quality, namely, |having few wishes::being content [appicchatā]|.”
