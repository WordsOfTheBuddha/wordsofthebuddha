At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans, in a town of the Koliyans called Pajjanika.

Then the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, taking his alms bowl and outer robe, went to the residence of the Koliyan noblewoman |Suppavāsā::foremost female lay disciple of the Buddha among those who offer excellent items [suppavāsā]|. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then Suppavāsā, the Koliyan noblewoman, with her own hands, served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of excellent food. Then, when the Blessed One had finished his meal and put away his bowl, Suppavāsā, the Koliyan noblewoman, sat down to one side. As she sat to one side, the Blessed One said this to Suppavāsā, the Koliyan noblewoman:

“Suppavāsā, when a female noble disciple gives food to the recipients, she gives four things. What four? She gives life, beauty, happiness, and strength. 1) Having given life, she becomes a partaker in life, whether divine or human. 2) Having given beauty, she becomes a partaker in beauty, whether divine or human. 3) Having given happiness, she becomes a partaker in happiness, whether divine or human. 4) Having given strength, she becomes a partaker in strength, whether divine or human. Suppavāsā, when a female noble disciple gives food to the recipients, she gives these four things.

She who gives well-prepared food,
pure, excellent, and rich in flavor;
to the upright ones who are
exalted and accomplished in conduct;
That offering, which links her merit to their merit,
is praised as very fruitful by the |world knowers::an epithet of the Buddhas [lokavidūna]|.

Those recollecting such an offering,
dwell in the world filled with joy;
Having completely rooted out the stain of |stinginess::selfishness, meanness, tight-fistedness [macchera]|,
they go blameless to the heavenly realm.”
