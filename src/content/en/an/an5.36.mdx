“Bhikkhus, there are these five suitable times for giving a gift. What five? 1) Giving a gift to a |guest::visitor, stranger [āgantuka]|; 2) Giving a gift to a |traveler::who is going on a journey [gamika]|; 3) Giving a gift to someone who is |sick::ill, unwell [gilāna]|; 4) Giving a gift during a time of |famine::scarcity, dearth [dubbhikkha]|; and 5) Giving new harvest and fresh fruits first to the |virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]|. These, bhikkhus, are the five suitable times for giving a gift.

The wise give at the right time,
generous, free from |stinginess::selfishness, meanness, tight-fistedness [macchara]|;
A gift given at the proper time to the Noble Ones,
to the upright ones, of steadfast nature.

For one with a serene mind,
their offering becomes abundant;
Those who rejoice in that offering,
or offer assistance there;
The gift is not diminished by that,
they too share in the merit.

Therefore, one should give without holding back,
where what is given yields great fruit;
Merits are the support for beings,
[when they arise] in the next world.”
