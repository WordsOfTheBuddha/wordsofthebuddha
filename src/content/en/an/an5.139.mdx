“Bhikkhus, a king’s elephant endowed with five [negative] qualities is not worthy of a king, not fit for royal service, and is not even counted as a component of the king’s retinue. What five? Here, bhikkhus, a king’s elephant is |unable to endure::intolerant of [akkhama]| forms, unable to endure sounds, unable to endure odors, unable to endure flavors, and unable to endure tangible objects.

And how, bhikkhus, is the king’s elephant unable to endure forms?

In this way, bhikkhus, the king’s elephant is unable to endure sounds.

And how, bhikkhus, is the king’s elephant unable to endure odors?

In this way, bhikkhus, the king’s elephant is unable to endure odors.

And how, bhikkhus, is the king’s elephant unable to endure flavors? Here, bhikkhus, when the king’s elephant has gone to battle, being slighted by a single bowl of grass and water, or by two, or three, or four, or five such offerings, he sinks down, flounders, does not remain steadfast, and is unable to enter the battlefield. In this way, bhikkhus, the king’s elephant is unable to endure flavors.

And how, bhikkhus, is the king’s elephant unable to endure tangible objects? Here, bhikkhus, when the king’s elephant has gone to battle, being pierced by one volley of arrows, or by two, three, four, or five such volleys, he sinks down, flounders, does not remain steadfast, and is unable to enter the battlefield. In this way, bhikkhus, the king’s elephant is unable to endure tangible objects.
