#### 1.1

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“I do not see any other form, bhikkhus, that so completely obsesses a man’s mind as the |form of a woman::image of a woman, feminine form [itthirūpa]|. The form of a woman, bhikkhus, obsesses a man’s mind.”
