"Bhikkhus, these three qualities lead to self-infliction of harm, to the harm of others, and to the harm of both. What are these three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct.

Indeed, bhikkhus, these three qualities lead to self-infliction of harm, to the harm of others, and to the harm of both.

Bhikkhus, these three qualities lead neither to self-infliction of harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. What are these three? Bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, and mental good conduct.

Indeed, bhikkhus, these three qualities lead neither to self-infliction of harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both."
