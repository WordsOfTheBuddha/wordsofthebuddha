“Bhikkhus, these are the eight gifts of a |true person::good person, worthy one, awakened being [sappurisa]|. What are the eight?

1) They give what is pure,

2) They give what is excellent,

3) They give at the proper time,

4) They give what is suitable,

5) They give with discernment,

6) They give frequently,

7) When giving, they gladden the mind,

8) Having given, they are |pleased::satisfied [attamana]|.

These, bhikkhus, are the eight gifts of a true person.

They give what is pure, excellent, at the proper time,
allowable drink and food;
They give gifts often,
to spiritual practitioners in fertile fields of merit.

They are not regretful,
having given up much |material wealth::worldly gain [āmisa]|;
Gifts given in this way,
are praised by those who see clearly.

Having given gifts in this way, the |wise one::who has good judgement [medhāvī]|,
rich in faith, with a freed mind;
Is reborn in a blissful world,
free from affliction and without suffering.
