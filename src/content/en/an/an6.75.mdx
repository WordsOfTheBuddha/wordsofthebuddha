“Bhikkhus, endowed with six qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering, with distress, anguish, and burning in this very life, and upon the breaking up of the body after death, a bad destination is to be expected. What six? With thoughts of sensuality, ill will, and harming, and with perceptions of sensuality, ill will, and harming — bhikkhus, endowed with these six qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering, with distress, anguish, and burning in this very life, and upon the breaking up of the body after death, a bad destination is to be expected.”
