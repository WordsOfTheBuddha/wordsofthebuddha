Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, I will explain to you the exposition on the six sense bases. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“‘The six internal sense bases should be understood, the six external sense bases should be understood, the six classes of consciousness should be understood, the six classes of contact should be understood, the eighteen mental explorations should be understood, the thirty-six modes of being should be understood. Therein, relying on this, abandon that. There are three establishments of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates—cultivating them, the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a group. He is called the unsurpassed trainer and guide of persons to be tamed.’ This is the summary of the exposition on the six sense bases.

‘The six internal sense bases should be understood’—this was this said. With reference to what was this said? ‘The |eye-base::field of the eye, visual sphere [cakkhāyatana]|, the |ear-base::field of the ear, auditory sphere [sotāyatana]|, the |nose-base::field of the nose, olfactory sphere [ghānāyatana]|, the |tongue-base::field of the tongue, gustatory sphere [jivhāyatana]|, the |body-base::field of the body, tactile sphere [kāyāyatana]|, the |mind-base::field of the mind, mental sphere [manāyatana]|—the six internal sense bases should be understood’—thus, that was said with reference to this.

‘The six external sense bases should be understood’—this was said. With reference to what was this said? ‘The |field of forms::realm of sights, material dimension [rūpāyatana]|, the |field of sounds::realm of noise [saddāyatana]|, the |field of smells::realm of odors [gandhāyatana]|, the |field of tastes::realm of flavors [rasāyatana]|, the |field of touch::realm of physical sensations [phoṭṭhabbāyatana]|, the |field of mental objects::field of mental phenomena, realm of qualia [dhammāyatana]|—the six external sense bases should be understood’—thus, that was said with reference to this.

‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood’—this was said. With reference to what was this said? The |eye-consciousness::awareness of visible forms; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [cakkhuviññāṇa]|, the |ear-consciousness::auditory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [sotaviññāṇa]|, the |nose-consciousness::olfactory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [ghānaviññāṇa]|, the |tongue-consciousness::gustatory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [jivhāviññāṇa]|, the |body-consciousness::tactile awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [kāyaviññāṇa]|, the |mind-consciousness::mental awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [manoviññāṇa]|—the six classes of consciousness should be understood’—thus, that was said with reference to this.

‘The six classes of contact should be understood’—this was said. With reference to what was this said? The |contact with the eye::visual impression, visual experience [cakkhusamphassa]|, the |contact with the ear::auditory impression, sonic experience [sotasamphassa]|, the |contact with the nose::olfactory impression, nasal experience [ghanasamphassa]|, the |contact with the tongue::gustatory impression, taste experience [jivhāsamphassa]|, the |physical contact::tactile impression, somatic experience [kāyasamphassa]|, the |contact with the mind::mental impression, cognitive experience [manasamphassa]|—the six classes of contact should be understood’—thus, that was said with reference to this.

‘The eighteen mental explorations should be understood’—this was said. With reference to what was this said? Having seen a |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| with the eye, one |explores::examines, ranges over, probes, investigates [upavicarati]| a form conducive to |pleasure::gladness, joy, positive state of mind [somanassa]|, a form conducive to |mental distress::dejection, depression, unhappiness, grief, negative state of mind [domanassa]|, a form conducive to |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|; having heard a sound with the ear, <collapse>one explores a sound conducive to pleasure, a sound conducive to mental distress, a sound conducive to equanimity;</collapse> having smelled an odor with the nose, <collapse>one explores an odor conducive to pleasure, an odor conducive to mental distress, an odor conducive to equanimity;</collapse> having tasted a flavor with the tongue, <collapse>one explores a flavor conducive to pleasure, a flavor conducive to mental distress, a flavor conducive to equanimity;</collapse>

having touched a tangible object with the body, <collapse>one explores a tangible object conducive to pleasure, a tangible object conducive to mental distress, a tangible object conducive to equanimity;</collapse> having touched a mental object with the mind, one explores a mental object conducive to pleasure, a mental object conducive to mental distress, a mental object conducive to equanimity. Thus, there are six explorations connected with pleasure, six explorations connected with mental distress, and six explorations connected with equanimity—the eighteen mental explorations should be understood’—thus, that was said with reference to this.

‘The thirty-six modes of being should be understood’—this was said. With reference to what was this said?
