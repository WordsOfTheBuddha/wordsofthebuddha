Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in the Eastern Park, at |Migāramātā’s mansion::name of a monastery outside Sāvatthī, built by Visākhā; lit. Migāra’s Mother’s Hall [migāramātupāsāda]|. Then Moggallāna the accountant, a brahmin, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One. After having engaged in courteous and polite conversation, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the accountant Moggallāna said to the Blessed One:

“Just as, sir Gotama, in this Migāramātā’s mansion, a gradual training, a gradual practice, and a gradual progression is seen—namely, in the structure of the staircase, step by step up to the final stair; so too, sir Gotama, for the Brahmins a gradual training, a gradual practice, and a gradual progression is seen—namely, in recitation; so too, sir Gotama, for the archers a gradual training, a gradual practice, and a gradual progression is seen—namely, in archery. And so too, sir Gotama, for us accountants, whose livelihood is in calculation, a gradual training, a gradual practice, and a gradual progression is seen—namely, in reckoning. For indeed, sir Gotama, when we receive a pupil, first we make him calculate thus: ‘one ones, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens’; we make him calculate even up to a hundred, and beyond that still. Now, sir Gotama, is it possible to describe a similar gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progression in this |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| and |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|?”

### Virtuous Conduct

“It is possible, brahmin, to describe a gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progression in this Dhamma and Vinaya as well. Just as, brahmin, a skilled horse trainer acquires a fine thoroughbred and initially trains it in the management of the bit, then proceeds to further training; similarly, friend brahmin, the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| initially trains a person thus: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be |virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]|, restrained with the restraint of the |moral code of conduct::monastic code of discipline which promotes harmonious and pure conduct with others [pātimokkha]|, know how to behave and keep to suitable places, see danger even in the slightest fault, and undertake the training by practicing the training rules.’

### Sense Restraint

When, brahmin, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the moral code of conduct, who knows how to behave and keep to suitable places, who sees danger even in the slightest fault, and undertakes the training by practicing the training rules, then the Tathāgata instructs him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, guard the doors of your sense faculties. 1.) Upon seeing a |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| with the eye, do not |grasp at its prominent features::focusing on its external characteristics [nimittaggāhī]| nor |be enticed by its details::focus on its secondary characteristics [anubyañjanaggāhī]|. For if the eye faculty remains unguarded, |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| states of |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| might |stream in::flood in, overwhelm him [anvāssavati]|. Therefore, practice restraint, guard the eye faculty, and attain the restraint of the eye faculty. 2.) In the same way, when hearing a |sound::an auditory object such as a sound, noise, melody, or verbal expression—whether it be praise, blame, honor, affection, or disrespect—that can stir emotion, memory, or craving [sadda]| with the ear, do not grasp at its prominent features nor be enticed by its details. For if the ear faculty remains unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in. Therefore, practice restraint, guard the ear faculty, and attain the restraint of the ear faculty. 3.) Similarly, when smelling an |odor::a smell or scent such as a fragrance, aroma, stench, perfume, or natural odor from a flower, food, or the earth—an olfactory experience that may trigger memory, comfort, craving, or aversion [gandha]| with the nose, do not grasp at its prominent features nor be enticed by its details. For if the nose faculty remains unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in. Therefore, practice restraint, guard the nose faculty, and attain the restraint of the nose faculty. 4.) Likewise, when tasting a |flavor::a taste or flavor such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle notes like umami or astringency—an object of gustatory experience that can become desirable, comforting, or indulgent [rasa]| with the tongue, do not grasp at its prominent features nor be enticed by its details. For if the tongue faculty remains unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in. Therefore, practice restraint, guard the tongue faculty, and attain the restraint of the tongue faculty. 5.) In the same manner, when touching a |tangible object::a tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, or pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| with the body, do not grasp at its prominent features nor be enticed by its details. For if the body faculty remains unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in. Therefore, practice restraint, guard the body faculty, and attain the restraint of the body faculty. 6.) Finally, when cognizing a |mental object::a mind object such as a thought, idea, memory, intention, emotion, image, or concept arising within the mind that becomes the object of awareness, reflection, craving, or aversion [dhamma]| with the mind, do not grasp at its prominent features nor be enticed by its details. For if the mind faculty remains unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in. Therefore, practice restraint, guard the mind faculty, and attain the restraint of the mind faculty.’

### Moderation in Eating

When, brahmin, a bhikkhu guards the doors of his sense faculties well, the Tathāgata instructs him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Consider wisely the food you consume — not for amusement, nor for indulgence, nor for physical appearance, nor for beautification, but only for the sustenance and maintenance of this body, for keeping it healthy, for aiding the spiritual life, thinking thus: ‘I will allay old feelings of hunger without arousing new feelings, and so that I may be healthy and blameless and live in comfort.’”

### Dedication to Wakefulness

When, brahmin, a bhikkhu is moderate in eating, the Tathāgata instructs him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, remain devoted to wakefulness. During the day, purify your mind from obstructive states through walking meditation and sitting meditation. During the first watch of the night, purify your mind in the same way; in the middle watch of the night, lie down on the right side in the lion’s posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your mind the idea of rising; in the last watch of the night, rise up and continue purifying your mind from obstructive states through walking meditation and sitting meditation.’”

### Mindfulness and Full Awareness

“When, brahmin, a bhikkhu is devoted to wakefulness, the Tathāgata instructs him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be endowed with mindfulness and full awareness. Be fully aware when going forward and returning; be fully aware when looking ahead and looking around; be fully aware when bending back and stretching out; be fully aware when wearing robes and carrying outer robe and bowl; be fully aware when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; be fully aware when defecating and urinating; be fully aware when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent.’

### Seclusion

When, brahmin, a bhikkhu is endowed with mindfulness and full awareness, the Tathāgata instructs him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, dwell in a secluded lodging — in the forest, at the foot of a tree, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in a jungle thicket, in an open space, or on a heap of straw.’ Thus, he dwells in a secluded lodging — in the forest, at the foot of a tree, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in a jungle thicket, in an open space, or on a heap of straw.

#### Abandoning the Five Hindrances

After his meal, having returned from the alms round, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishes mindfulness as first priority. Abandoning |craving::greediness, wanting, yearning [abhijjhā]| with regard to the world, he dwells with a mind free from craving; he purifies his mind from craving. Abandoning |ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construct fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]| and |aversion::hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, he dwells with a benevolent mind, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and aversion. Abandoning |dullness and drowsiness::lack of mental clarity or alertness, mental sluggishness, lethargy, sleepiness lit. stiffness (of mind/body due to tiredness) [thinamiddha]|, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful, and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Abandoning |restlessness and worry::agitation and edginess, distraction, fidgeting, fiddling, uneasiness [uddhaccakukkucca]|, he dwells unagitated, with a mind inwardly calmed; he purifies his mind from restlessness and worry. Abandoning |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness wrt suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering [vicikiccha]|, he dwells having crossed beyond doubt, without perplexity about wholesome mental states; he purifies his mind from doubt.

#### Dwell in Jhānas

Having abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and |imbued with joyful pleasure::imbued with joy and happiness, with delight and ease, sometimes experienced as an intense joy or pleasure, rapture [pītisukha]|. With the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with joyful pleasure. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna which the Noble Ones describe as ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful and at ease.’ With the abandonment of ease and |discontentment::discomfort, unpleasantness, something unsatisfactory, stress [dukkha]|, and with the settling down of |joy and sorrow::craving and aversion, pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, gladness and dejection, positive state of mind and negative state of mind [somanassadomanassa]|, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant.

Those bhikkhus, brahmin, who are trainees, aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage, abide thus. But those bhikkhus who are arahants, |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|, who have fulfilled the spiritual life, who have done what had to be done, having put down the burden, having achieved the highest goal, |having exhausted the fetter of existence::who has worn away the bonds of continued conditional existence, i.e. the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojana]|, and |who are freed through complete comprehension::who are liberated by perfect understanding, epithet of an Arahant [sammadaññāvimutta]|, for them these teachings lead to dwelling in ease here and to mindfulness and full awareness.”

### Who Attains Nibbāna

Thus having spoken, the brahmin accountant Moggallāna asked the Blessed One: “Sir Gotama, do all your disciples who are instructed and guided by you in this way attain final Nibbāna without exception, or do some not attain it?”

“Some of my disciples, brahmin, being instructed and guided by me in this manner, attain final Nibbāna, the ultimate goal, while others do not.”

“What is the cause, sir Gotama, and what is the reason that while Nibbāna exists, the path leading to Nibbāna exists, and you, sir Gotama, are present to encourage, yet when instructed and guided by you, some of your disciples attain final Nibbāna, the ultimate goal, while others do not?”

“As to that, brahmin, I will ask you a question in return. Answer it as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin, are you familiar with the path leading to Rājagaha?”

“Yes, sir Gotama, I am familiar with the path leading to Rājagaha.”

“What do you think, brahmin, if a man came to you wishing to go to Rājagaha, and said, ‘Venerable sir, I wish to go to Rājagaha; show me the path to Rājagaha.’ Then you told him: ‘Good man, this is the path, go in this direction, and after a while, you will see a certain village, go a little further and you will see a certain town, then go a little further and you will find yourself in Rājagaha with its delightful parks, groves, meadows and ponds.’ If, after being advised and instructed by you, this person would take a wrong track and go to the west. Then a second man came who wanted to go to Rājagaha approached you and said: ‘Venerable sir, I wish to go to Rājagaha; show me the path to Rājagaha.’ Then you told him: ‘Good man, this is the path, go in this direction, and after a while, you will see a certain village, go a little further and you will see a certain town, then go a little further and you will find yourself in Rājagaha with its delightful parks, groves, meadows and ponds.’ Then, having been thus advised and instructed by you, he would arrive safely in Rājagaha. Now, brahmin, since Rājagaha exists and the path leading to Rājagaha exists and you are present as the guide, what is the cause and reason why, when those men have been thus advised and instructed by you, one man takes a wrong track and goes to the west and one arrives safely in Rājagaha?”

“What can I do, sir Gotama, in that situation? I am only the one who shows the way.”

“Similarly, brahmin, Nibbāna exists, the path leading to Nibbāna exists, and I am here to instruct; yet my disciples, being instructed and guided by me, some attain final Nibbāna and some do not. What can I do, brahmin? I am only the one who shows the way.”

Upon hearing this, the brahmin accountant Moggallāna said to the Blessed One: “There are those, sir Gotama, who lack faith, who have left the household life for a livelihood, not out of faith. They are crafty, deceitful, treacherous, |restless::agitated, unbalanced, confused about what is right and wrong [uddhata]|, |arrogant::conceited, haughty [unnaḷa]|, |unsteady::wavering, fickle, inconsistent [capala]|, |talkative::big-mouthed [mukhara]|, |chatty::with scattered speech [vikiṇṇavāca]|, |with unguarded sense faculties::uncontrolled in senses, not having self-restraint [aguttadvāratā]|, lacking moderation in eating, not devoted to wakefulness, indifferent to the ascetic life, without keen respect for the training, |indulgent::excessive, living luxuriously, extravagant [bāhulika]|, |careless::loose, lethargic, lax [sāthalika]|, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion, |indolent::lazy, inactive person, indolent [kusītā]|, |weak in effort::low in energy, lacking in endurance [hīnavīriya]|, |muddle-minded::forgetful, not mindful [muṭṭhassatī]|, |lacking clear awareness::inattentive [asampajāna]|, |distracted::with scattered attention, not collected, not well-composed [asamāhita]|, |with a wandering mind::with runaway thoughts, mentally out of control [vibbhantacitta]|, |undiscerning::without wisdom [duppañña]|, and uninformed—these, sir Gotama, do not live in close association with you.

But those clansmen who have left the household life out of faith, who are not crafty, deceitful, or treacherous, who are not  restless, arrogant, unsteady, talkative, or chatty, with guarded sense faculties, moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, with regard for the ascetic life, with keen respect for the training, not indulgent or careless, who are keen to avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, |with energy aroused::with initiative [āraddhavīriya]|, |determined::resolute, applying oneself [pahitatta]|, who |attend mindfully::are with presence of mind [upaṭṭhitassatī]|, |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]|, |collected::composed, settled [samāhita]|, |with a unified mind::with a one-pointed mind; with an integrated, well-composed, concentrated mind [ekaggacitta]|, |wise::discerning, percipient [paññavant]|, perceptive—these, sir Gotama, indeed live in close association with you.

Just as |kāḷānusāriya fragrance::dominant fragrance [kāḷānusāri]| is reckoned as the best of root fragrances and red sandalwood is reckoned as the best of heartwood fragrances and jasmine is reckoned as the best of flower fragrances, so too, sir Gotama’s advice is the highest among the teachings of today.

Excellent, sir Gotama! Excellent, sir Gotama! Just as if one might set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way, sir Gotama, the Dhamma has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by you in many ways. I go for refuge to venerable Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. May venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life.”
