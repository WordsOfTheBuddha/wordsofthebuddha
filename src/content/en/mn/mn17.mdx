Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you a discourse on forest retreats. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

### Dependence on a Forest Retreat

“Bhikkhus, here a bhikkhu dwells in dependence on a forest retreat. However, while dwelling there, his unestablished |mindfulness::memory, remembering, recollection; keeping in mind [sati]| does not become established, his distracted mind does not become collected, the taints that are not exhausted do not come to exhaustion, and he does not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage. Additionally, the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth — robes, alms food, resting place, and medicinal requisites, are hard to come by. On account of that, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu should reflect thus: ‘I am dwelling in dependence on this forest retreat, but my unestablished mindfulness does not become established, my distracted mind does not become collected, the taints that are not exhausted do not come to exhaustion, and I do not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage. Additionally, the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth — robes, alms food, resting place, and medicinal requisites, are hard to come by.’ Having reflected thus, that bhikkhu should depart from that forest retreat that very night or that very day; he should not remain there.

Yet, the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth — robes, alms food, resting place, and medicinal requisites, are easily obtained. However, it was not for the sake of robes that I went forth from the household life into homelessness, nor for the sake of alms food, nor for the sake of a resting place, nor for the sake of medicinal requisites for the sick. Moreover, while I dwell in dependence on this forest retreat, my unestablished mindfulness does not become established, my distracted mind does not become collected, the taints that are not exhausted do not come to exhaustion, and I do not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage.’ Having reflected thus, that bhikkhu should with a sense of urgency, depart from that forest retreat, and should not remain there.”
