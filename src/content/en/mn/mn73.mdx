Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was residing in |Rājagaha::name of a city; capital of Magadha; lit. king's house [rājagaha]|, at the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground.

Then, the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after this friendly exchange, he sat down to one side. As he was seated to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: “For a long time, I have been a companion in discussion with sir Gotama. It would be good if sir Gotama would teach me about what is |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| and what is |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| in brief.”

### Wholesome and Unwholesome

“Vaccha, I could teach you about what is wholesome and what is unwholesome in brief or I could teach you about what is wholesome and what is unwholesome in detail. Still, Vaccha, I will teach you about what is wholesome and what is unwholesome in brief. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the wanderer Vacchagotta replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“|Greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; |non-greed::the absence of greed, lack of craving or lustful wanting; contentment, renunciation [alobha]| is wholesome. |Aversion::hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; |non-aversion::the absence of aversion, ill will, or hostility; loving-kindness, goodwill, friendliness [adosa]| is wholesome. |Delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; |non-delusion::the absence of illusion, misapprehension, or distorted view; clear comprehension, understanding things as they really are [amoha]| is wholesome. Thus, Vaccha, these three qualities are unwholesome, and these three qualities are wholesome.

|Killing living beings::taking life, destruction of life [pāṇātipāta]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstinence from killing living beings is wholesome. |Taking what is not given::theft, stealing, taking what is not offered [adinnādāna]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstinence from taking what is not given is wholesome. |Sexual misconduct::misbehavior in matters of sensuality, wrong sexual behavior [kāmesumicchācāra]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstinence from sexual misconduct is wholesome. |False speech::lying, deliberately speaking falsehood [musāvāda]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstinence from false speech is wholesome. |Divisive speech::slanderous, defamatory, malicious speech [pisuṇavācā]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstinence from divisive speech is wholesome. |Harsh speech::abusive, rude, or unkind way of speaking [pharusāvācā]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstinence from harsh speech is wholesome. |Frivolous chatter::meaningless talk, gossip, idle speech [samphappalāpa]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstinence from frivolous chatter is wholesome. |Craving::greediness, wanting, yearning [abhijjhā]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; absence of craving is wholesome. |Ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construct fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; |good will::kindness, friendliness, benevolence [abyāpāda]| is wholesome. |Wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|, Vaccha, is unwholesome; |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]| is wholesome. Thus, Vaccha, these ten qualities are unwholesome, and these ten qualities are wholesome.

### Accomplishments of the Disciples

Vaccha, when craving has been abandoned by a bhikkhu, |cut off at the root::eradicated at the source [ucchinnamūla]|, made like a palm stump, utterly obliterated, and rendered incapable of arising in the future, he becomes an arahant, one |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|, who has fulfilled one’s training, who has done what needs to be done, who has put down the burden, who has achieved the highest goal, |who has exhausted the fetter of existence::who has worn away the bonds of continued conditional existence, i.e. the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojana]|, and who is liberated through complete comprehension.”

“Let that be, sir Gotama. Is there, sir Gotama, even one bhikkhu among your disciples who, with the wearing away of the mental defilements in this very life, has realized for himself with |direct knowledge::experiential realization [abhiññā]| the taintless |liberation of mind::mental liberation, emancipation of heart, a meditation attainment [cetovimutti]| and |liberation by wisdom::emancipation by insight [paññāvimutti]| and having realized it, abides in it?”

“Vaccha, there are not only one hundred or two or three or four or five hundred, but even more bhikkhus, my disciples, who, with the wearing away of the mental defilements in this very life, have realized for themselves with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom and having realized it, abide in it.”

“Let that be, sir Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus. Is there even one |bhikkhunī::female monastic, fully ordained nun [bhikkhunī]| among your disciples who, with the wearing away of the mental defilements in this very life, has realized for herself with direct knowledge, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom and having realized it, abides in it?”

“Vaccha, there are not merely one hundred or two or three or four or five hundred, but even more bhikkhunīs, my disciples, who, with the wearing away of the mental defilements in this very life, have realized for themselves with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom and having realized it, and abide in it.”

“Let that be, sir Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs. Is there even one male lay disciple among your followers, a white-clothed |layperson::householder [gihī]| practicing celibacy, who, with the |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]| of the five lower fetters, will be spontaneously reborn [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that world?”

“Vaccha, there are not merely one hundred or two or three or four or five hundred, but even more male lay followers, my disciples, white-clothed laypersons practicing celibacy, who, with the complete exhaustion of the five lower fetters, will be spontaneously reborn [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that world.”

“Let that be, venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs, let it be with the male lay disciples, white-clothed laypersons practicing celibacy. Is there even one male lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who has overcome doubt, free from confusion, self-assured and independent of others, and lives relying on the Teacher’s instruction?”

“No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the male lay disciples who are my followers, wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who has overcome doubt, free from confusion, self-assured and independent of others, and live relying on the Teacher’s instruction.”

“Let that be, venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and enjoying sensual pleasures. Is there even one female lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibbāna there, not returning to this world?”

“No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the female lay disciples who are my followers, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, have been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibbāna there, not returning to this world.”

“Let that be, venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and enjoying sensual pleasures, let it be with the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy. Is there even one female lay disciple among your followers, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who has overcome doubt, free from confusion, self-assured and independent of others, and lives relying on the Teacher’s instruction?”

“No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the female lay disciples who are my followers, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who has overcome doubt, free from confusion, self-assured and independent of others, and live relying on the Teacher’s instruction.”

“If, venerable Gotama, only you had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the bhikkhus, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, venerable Gotama, you have accomplished this Dhamma, and the bhikkhus have also accomplished it, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.

If, venerable Gotama, only you and the bhikkhus had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the bhikkhunīs, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, venerable Gotama, you have accomplished this Dhamma, the bhikkhus have also accomplished it, and the bhikkhunīs have accomplished it, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhunīs had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.

If, venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.

Just as, venerable Gotama, the Ganges River inclines towards the ocean, flows towards the ocean, slopes towards the ocean, and reaches the ocean, in the same way, this assembly of yours, venerable Gotama, including householders and those gone forth, inclines towards Nibbāna, flows towards Nibbāna, slopes towards Nibbāna, and reaches Nibbāna.

Excellent, venerable Gotama ... I go to venerable Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. May I receive the going forth under venerable Gotama, may I receive the full ordination.

“Vaccha, one who has previously followed another sect and wishes to go forth and receive full ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline must wait for four months. At the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they give him the going forth and the full ordination. However, I recognize individual differences in this matter.”

“Venerable sir, if those who have previously followed another sect and wish to go forth and receive full ordination in this Dhamma and discipline wait for four months, and at the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they give them the going forth and the full ordination, I will wait for four years. At the end of four years, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, let them give me the going forth and the full ordination.” Vacchagotta the wanderer received the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One and received the full ordination.

Shortly after his ordination, within half a month, venerable Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, venerable Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, to whatever extent higher knowledge and true understanding can be attained by a trainee, I have attained that. Let the Blessed One teach me further.”

### Three Knowledges

“Then, Vaccha, develop further the two qualities of tranquility and insight. For when these two qualities are developed further, they lead to the penetration of various states.

Then, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will experience various kinds of supernormal powers: being one, you will become many; having been many, you will become one; you will appear and disappear; you will pass through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain unhindered as if through space; you will dive in and emerge from the earth as if it were water; you will walk on water without sinking as though on solid ground; you will fly cross-legged through the sky, like a bird; with hand, you will touch and stroke the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful; with the body, you will exercise control even as far as the Brahmā world. You will achieve directly knowing of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.

Then, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will hear, with the divine ear element, purified and surpassing the human range, both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. You will achieve directly knowing of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.

Then, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will know the minds of other beings, other individuals, with your mind. You will understand a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind free of passion as a mind free of passion; a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind free of aversion as a mind free of aversion; a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind free of delusion as a mind free of delusion; a contracted mind as a contracted mind, and a distracted mind as a distracted mind; a developed mind as a developed mind, and an undeveloped mind as an undeveloped mind; a surpassable mind as a surpassable mind, and an unsurpassable mind as an unsurpassable mind; a collected mind as a collected mind, and an uncollected mind as an uncollected mind; a liberated mind as a liberated mind, and an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind. You will achieve directly knowing of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.

Then, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will recollect your manifold past lives, such as one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world contraction, many eons of world expansion, many eons of world contraction and expansion: ‘There I was, named so-and-so, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my sustenance, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; and there too I was named so-and-so, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my sustenance, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’ Thus, with their aspects and particulars, you will recollect your manifold past lives. You will achieve directly knowing of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.

Then, Vaccha, as much as you wish, with the |divine eye::the faculty of clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the ordinary human range [dibbacakkhu]|, purified and surpassing the human ability, you will see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good destinations and bad destinations, and you will understand how beings are reborn according to their actions: ‘These beings, indeed, endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, revilers of the Noble Ones, with wrong views, undertaking actions under the influence of wrong views, with the break-up of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell; but these beings, indeed, endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, not revilers of the Noble Ones, with right views, undertaking actions under the influence of right views, with the break-up of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’ Thus, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human ability, you will see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good destinations and bad destinations, and you will understand how beings are reborn according to their actions. You will achieve directly knowing of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.

Then, Vaccha, as much as you wish, by the wearing away of the mental defilements, you will attain the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it for yourself with direct knowledge in this very life, and you will abide in it. You will achieve directly knowing of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.

Then venerable Vacchagotta rejoiced and approved of the Blessed One’s words. He rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.

Then venerable Vacchagotta, being alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute, soon realized for himself with direct knowledge in this very life that ultimate goal of the spiritual life, for the sake of which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.

He directly knew: “Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.” Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the Arahants.

At that time, several bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed One. Venerable Vacchagotta saw them coming from afar. Seeing them, he went to meet them and said, “Where are you venerable ones going?”

“We are going to see the Blessed One, friend,” they replied.

“Then, venerable ones, pay homage to the Blessed One on my behalf with your heads at his feet and say this: ‘Venerable sir, Vacchagotta pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet and says, “The Blessed One is fully served by me, the Blessed One is fully honored by me.”'”

“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Vacchagotta. Then they went to the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to him and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, venerable Vacchagotta pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet and says, ‘The Blessed One is fully served by me, the Blessed One is fully honored by me.’”

“Even before, bhikkhus, I knew by mind that the bhikkhu Vacchagotta is endowed with the three true knowledges, is mighty, and has great power. The deities also informed me: ‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhus Vacchagotta is endowed with the three true knowledges, is mighty, and has great power.’”

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and pleased with the Blessed One’s words.
