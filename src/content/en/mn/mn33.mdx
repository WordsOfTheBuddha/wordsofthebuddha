Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, a cowherd possessing eleven factors is incapable of maintaining and growing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here a cowherd |does not know forms::does not understand materiality [na + rūpaññū]|, is not skilled in |characteristics::qualities, salient features [lakkhaṇa]|, he fails to remove flies’ eggs, fails to dress wounds, fails to smoke out the sheds, he does not know the |crossing::bank, shore; lit. crossing place [tittha]|, does not know |the source of refreshment::lit. what it is to have drunk [pītaṁ]|, does not know the path, he is not skilled in pastures, he |milks [the cows] dry::lit. milking with no remainder [anavasesadohī]|, and he does not honor with additional veneration those bulls who are the fathers and leaders of the herd. A cowherd possessing these eleven factors, bhikkhus, is incapable of maintaining and growing a herd of cattle.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu possessing eleven qualities is incapable of attaining growth, increase, and fullness in this |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| and |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|. What eleven? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not one who knows forms, is not skilled in characteristics, he fails to remove flies’ eggs, fails to dress wounds, fails to smoke out the sheds, does not know the crossing, does not know what is drinkable, does not know the path, he is not skilled in pastures, he is one who milks dry, and he does not honor with additional veneration those bhikkhus who are elders, of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]|.

1.) And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu not know forms? Here a bhikkhu does not understand as it actually is thus: ‘All material form of whatever kind consists of the four great elements and the material form derived from the four great elements.’ In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not know forms.

2.) And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu not skilled in characteristics? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not truly understand as it actually is thus: ‘An |immature person::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]| is characterized by their actions, a wise person is characterized by their actions.’ In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not skilled in characteristics.

3.) And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu fail to remove flies’ eggs? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu |tolerates::agrees to, lit. to cause to be endured [adhivāseti]| an arisen |thought of sensuality::thought related to enjoyment of sensual pleasures, sexual thought [kāmavitakka]|, does not abandon it, does not dispel it, does not eliminate it, and does not bring it to an end. He tolerates an arisen |thought of ill will::intentional thought of mental rejection, hostility, or malevolence toward others; deliberate contemplation rooted in antipathy or wishing harm [byāpādavitakka]|, <collapse>does not abandon it, does not dispel it, does not eliminate it, and does not bring it to an end.</collapse> He tolerates an arisen |thought of harming::idea of hurting, thought of cruelty [vihiṁsāvitakka]|, <collapse>does not abandon it, does not dispel it, does not eliminate it, and does not bring it to an end.</collapse> He tolerates arisen |harmful::injurious, bad, or evil. Encompasses the deceptively alluring that is ultimately detrimental or ruinous [pāpaka]| |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| states, does not abandon them, does not dispel them, does not eliminate them, and does not bring them to an end. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu fails to remove flies’ eggs.

4.) And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu fail to dress wounds? Here, bhikkhus, having seen a |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| with the eye, a bhikkhu |grasps at its prominent features::focusing on its external characteristics [nimittaggāhī]| and is |enticed by its details::focused on its secondary characteristics [anubyañjanaggāhī]|. Even though, if he were to dwell with the eye faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| might |stream in::flood in, overwhelm him [anvāssavati]|, he does not practice restraint in this regard, he does not guard the eye faculty, and he does not undertake the restraint of the eye faculty.  Having heard a |sound::an auditory object such as a sound, noise, melody, or verbal expression—whether it be praise, blame, honor, affection, or disrespect—that can stir emotion, memory, or craving [sadda]| with the ear, having smelled an |odor::a smell or scent such as a fragrance, aroma, stench, perfume, or natural odor from a flower, food, or the earth—an olfactory experience that may trigger memory, comfort, craving, or aversion [gandha]| with the nose, having tasted a |flavor::a taste or flavor such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle notes like umami or astringency—an object of gustatory experience that can become desirable, comforting, or indulgent [rasa]| with the tongue, having touched a |tangible object::a tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, or pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| with the body, or having cognized a |mental object::a mind object such as a thought, idea, memory, intention, emotion, image, or concept arising within the mind that becomes the object of awareness, reflection, craving, or aversion [dhamma]| with the mind, a bhikkhu grasps at its prominent features and is enticed by its details. Even though, if he were to dwell with the mind faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in, he does not practice restraint in this regard, he does not guard the mind faculty, and he does not undertake the restraint of the mind faculty. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu fails to dress wounds.

5.) And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu fail to smoke out the sheds? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not teach the Dhamma to others in detail as he has learned it and mastered it. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu fails to smoke out the sheds.

6.) And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu not know the crossing? Here, bhikkhus, he does not, from time to time, approach those bhikkhus who are |very learned::well educated, knowledgeable [bahussutā]|, heirs to the scriptures, |who know the Dhamma by heart::lit. Dhamma bearer [dhammadhara]|, |experts in Vinaya::keepers of the monastic law [vinayadhara]|, and |keepers of the summaries::who know the summaries of the Dhamma and Vinaya [mātikādharā]|, to question and cross-question them: ‘Venerable sir, what is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of that?’ Those venerable ones then do not reveal to him what is unrevealed, do not clarify what is obscured, and do not dispel his |doubt::uncertainty, perplexity, hesitation—especially in relation to faith, truth, or decision-making on the path [kaṅkhā]| about many perplexing points in the Dhamma. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not know the crossing.

7.) And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu not know the source of refreshment? Here, bhikkhus, when the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| is being taught, he does not gain inspiration from |realization of meaning::knowing, understanding, having insight about; originally referring to the sacred Brahminical oral tradition and scriptures, which represented the height of learned knowledge at the time [veda]|, does not gain inspiration in the Dhamma, and does not gain |joy::cheerfulness, gladness; a fresh and mild happiness arising from a sense of spiritual well-being and a clear conscience [pāmojja]| connected with the Dhamma. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not know the source of refreshment.

8.) And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu not know the path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not understand the Noble Eightfold Path as it actually is. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not know the path.

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not understand the |four establishments of mindfulness::four foundations or objective domains of mindfulness that one gradually establishes and cultivates as a direct way of practice [cattāro + satipaṭṭhāna]| as they actually are. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not skilled in pastures.

10.) And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu one who milks dry? Here, when faithful householders invite a bhikkhu to take as much as he likes of robes, alms food, lodgings, |healthcare::support for the sick [gilānappaccaya]|, and medicinal requisites, the bhikkhu does not know moderation in accepting. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who milks dry.

11.) And how is it, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu does not honor with additional veneration those bhikkhus who are elders, of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not maintain bodily acts of |loving-kindness::goodwill, friendliness, benevolence [metta]| both openly and in private toward those bhikkhus who are elders, of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha. He does not maintain verbal acts of loving-kindness both openly and in private toward them, and he does not maintain mental acts of loving-kindness both openly and in private toward them. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not honor with additional veneration those bhikkhus who are elders, of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu possessing these eleven qualities is incapable of attaining growth, increase, and fullness in this Dhamma and Vinaya.

Bhikkhus, a cowherd endowed with eleven factors is capable of maintaining and growing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here, bhikkhus, a cowherd knows forms, is skilled in characteristics,he removes flies’ eggs, dresses wounds, smokes out the sheds, he knows the crossing, knows the source of refreshment, knows the path, he is skilled in pastures, he milks leaving a remainder, and he honors with additional veneration those bulls who are the fathers and leaders of the herd.
