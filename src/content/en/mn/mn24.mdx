Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground.

Then a number of bhikkhus, who were from the same native region, having completed the rains retreat in that region, went to the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage and sat down to one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One said to them:

“Bhikkhus, who is the bhikkhu in your native region who is esteemed by his companions in the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| in this way: ‘He himself is |with few desires::having few needs, who is modest [appiccha]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on fewness of desires; he himself is |content::satisfied, pleased [santuṭṭha]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on contentment; he himself is |secluded::detached, solitary [pavivitta]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on seclusion; he himself is aloof and speaks to other bhikkhus on |non-association::aloofness, detachment, non-association [asaṃsagga]|; he is energetic himself and speaks to other bhikkhus on |rousing of energy::taking initiative, making a mental decision to act [vīriyārambha]|; he is |accomplished in virtue::of excellent morality; accomplished in virtue [sīlasampanna]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of virtue; he is |accomplished in collectedness::accomplished in stability of mind, skilled in mental stillness [samādhisampanna]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of collectedness; he is accomplished in |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of wisdom; he is accomplished in |liberation::release, deliverance, freedom, emancipation [vimutti]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of liberation; he is accomplished in |knowledge and vision of liberation::understanding and realization of liberation, total understanding of emancipation [vimuttiñāṇadassana]| and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of knowledge and vision of liberation; he is one who advises, instructs, explains, encourages, inspires, and gladdens his companions in the spiritual life?’”

“Venerable sir, the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta is the one in our native region who is esteemed by his companions in the spiritual life in this way: ‘He himself is with few desires and speaks to other bhikkhus on fewness of desires; he himself is content <collapse>and speaks to other bhikkhus on contentment; he himself is secluded and speaks to other bhikkhus on seclusion; he himself is aloof and speaks to other bhikkhus on non-association; he himself is energetic and speaks to other bhikkhus on the rousing of energy; he himself is accomplished in virtue and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of virtue; he himself is accomplished in collectedness and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of collectedness; he himself is accomplished in wisdom and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of wisdom; he himself is accomplished in liberation and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of liberation; he himself is accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation and speaks to other bhikkhus on the attainment of the knowledge and vision of liberation;</collapse> and he is one who advises, instructs, explains, encourages, inspires, and gladdens his companions in the spiritual life.’”

Now on that occasion the venerable Sāriputta was seated near the Blessed One. Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta:

“It is a blessing for the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, it is most fortunate for the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, that his wise companions in the spiritual life praise him point by point in the Teacher’s presence, and the Teacher approves. Perhaps, at some time or other, we might meet the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta and have some conversation with him.”

Then the Blessed One, having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he wished, set out on a wandering tour toward Sāvatthi. Traveling on that tour by stages, he eventually arrived at Sāvatthi. There, the Blessed One dwelt at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. The venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta heard: “The Blessed One has arrived at Sāvatthi and is staying in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.”

Then the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, having put his lodging in order and taking his bowl and robe, set out on a wandering tour toward Sāvatthi. Traveling on that tour by stages, he arrived at Sāvatthi, at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park, where the Blessed One was staying. Having approached the Blessed One, he paid homage and sat down to one side. When the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta was seated to one side, the Blessed One gave him a talk on the Dhamma—explaining, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening him. Then the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One’s talk on the Dhamma, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he went to the Blind Men’s Grove for the day’s abiding.
