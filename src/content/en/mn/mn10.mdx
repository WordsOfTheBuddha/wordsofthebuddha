commentary:
  - "[1] Observing the body in and of itself internally refers to observing the breathing within. Observing the body in and of itself externally refers to observing the breathing occurring in the body of another. Regardless of the distinction of the internal or the external, the observations hold the same purpose of understanding the nature of the body. Similar also applies for observing the felt experience in and of itself internally or externally, the mind in and of itself internally or externally, and the mental qualities in and of themselves internally or externally."

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the land of the Kurus, in a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

“This is the direct way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of |discomfort and distress::physical pain and mental suffering [dukkhadomanassa]|, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|, namely the |four establishments of mindfulness::four foundations or objective domains of mindfulness that one gradually establishes and cultivates as a direct way of practice [cattāro + satipaṭṭhāna]|.

What are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, clearly aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world; he dwells observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, clearly aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; he dwells observing the |mind::the faculty of thought and intention, often restless or wandering [citta]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, clearly aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; he dwells observing the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| in and of themselves, with continuous effort, clearly aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world.

Summary completed.

### 1. Observing the Body

#### 1.1. Body Contemplation with Breathing

How, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell |observing the body in and of itself::contemplating the body as a body [kāye kāyānupassī]|?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, aligns his body upright, and establishes mindfulness as first priority. Mindfully, he breathes in; mindfully, he breathes out.

Breathing in long, he |discerns::distinguishes, understands, knows clearly [pajānāti]|, ‘I am breathing in long;’ breathing out long, he discerns, ‘I am breathing out long;’

breathing in short, he discerns, ‘I am breathing in short;’ breathing out short, he discerns, ‘I am breathing out short.’

He trains thus, ‘While breathing in, I shall |experience the whole body::be conscious of the whole body, be sensitive to the whole process [sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī]|;’ he trains thus, ‘While breathing out, I shall experience the whole body.’

He trains thus, ‘While breathing in, I shall |settle::calm, still [passambhayanta]| the |bodily constructs::bodily processes associated with breathing, specifically the in-and-out breath. It encompasses the physical movements and sensations that arise from the act of breathing. [kāyasaṅkhāra]|;’ he trains thus, ‘While breathing out, I shall settle the bodily constructs.’

Just as a skilled |turner::A turner is a craftsman who shapes objects, like wood or metal, using a tool called a lathe. They carefully control the turning process to make smooth, precise shapes [bhamakāra]| or his apprentice, when making a long turn discerns, ‘I make a long turn,’ or making a short turn discerns, ‘I make a short turn;’ so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu discerns, ‘I am breathing in long;’ breathing out long, he discerns, ‘I am breathing out long;’ breathing in short, he discerns, ‘I am breathing in short;’ breathing out short, he discerns, ‘I am breathing out short;’ he trains thus, ‘While breathing in, I shall experience the whole body;’ he trains thus, ‘While breathing out, I shall experience the whole body;’ he trains thus, ‘While breathing in, I shall settle the bodily constructs;’ he trains thus, ‘While breathing out, I shall settle the bodily constructs.’

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally^[1]^. He dwells observing the |arising::appearance, origination [samudaya]| nature in the body, or he dwells observing the |vanishing::disappearing [vaya]| nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on Mindfulness of Breathing is completed.

#### 1.2. Body Contemplation in Postures

Furthermore, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu discerns, ‘I am walking;’ when standing, he discerns, ‘I am standing;’ when sitting, he discerns, ‘I am sitting;’ when lying down, he discerns, ‘I am lying down.’ In whatever way his body is |oriented::disposed; lit. placed down forward [paṇihita]|, he discerns it accordingly.

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on Postures is completed.

#### 1.3. Body Contemplation with Clear Awareness

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu acts with |clear awareness::attentiveness, clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]| when going forward and returning; he acts with clear awareness when looking ahead and looking around; he acts with clear awareness when bending back and stretching out; he acts with clear awareness when wearing robes and carrying outer robe and bowl; he acts with clear awareness when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; he acts with clear awareness when defecating and urinating; he acts with clear awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent.

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on clear awareness is completed.

#### 1.4. Contemplating the Disagreeable in the Body

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu |reviews::considers, reflects [paccavekkhati]| this very body from the soles of the feet upwards and from the top of the hair downwards, bounded by skin and full of various impurities thus: ‘In this body, there are hairs of the head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, |sinews::tendons and ligaments connecting muscle to bone [nhāru]|, bones, |bone marrow::the soft tissue inside the bones [aṭṭhimiñjaṁ]|, kidneys; heart, liver, |inner membrane::the pleura or fascia wrapping the organs [kilomaka]|, |spleen::the blood-filtering organ under the left ribs [pihaka]|, lungs; intestines, |mesentery::the tissue binding the intestines; lit. intestine string [antaguṇa]|, |stomach contents::undigested food; lit. related to the belly [udariya]|, |feces::excrement, digested waste [karīsaṁ]|, [brain]; |bile::digestive fluid, usually visualized in the gall bladder [pittaṁ]|, |phlegm::mucus of the respiratory tract [semha]|, |pus::fluid resulting from infection or decay [pubba]|, blood, |sweat::perspiration exuded from pore spaces [seda]|, |fat::thick, adipose tissue [meda]|, tears, |grease::liquid fat or skin oils (distinct from solid fat) [vasā]|, saliva, |nasal mucus::snot, fluid from the nose [siṅghāṇikā]|, |synovial fluid::lubricating fluid inside the joints [lasikā]|, and |urine::liquid waste stored in the bladder [mutta]|.’

Just as if, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grains, such as rice, barley, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyesight having opened it were to reflect, ‘These are rice, these are barley, these are beans, these are peas, these are millet, these are white rice.’

In just the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body from the soles of the feet upwards and from the top of the hair downwards, bounded by skin and full of various impurities thus: ‘In this body, there are hairs of the head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys; heart, liver, inner membrane, spleen, lungs; intestines, mesentery, stomach contents, feces, [brain]; bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid, and urine.’

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on attention to the disagreeable is completed.

#### 1.5. Contemplating the Elements in the Body

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body, in whatever way it is positioned, in whatever way it is oriented, considering it in terms of the elements thus: ‘In this body, there is the |earth element::whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]|, the |water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|, the |fire element::whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]|, and the |wind element::whatever internal or external that is airy, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [vāyodhātu]|.’

Just as if, bhikkhus, a skilled butcher or their apprentice, having slaughtered a cow, were sitting at a crossroads, having divided it up piece by piece.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body, however it is oriented, however it is placed, considering it in terms of the elements: ‘In this body, there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the wind element.’

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on observing the elements in the body is completed.

#### 1.6. The Nine Charnel Ground Contemplations

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a |charnel ground::an above-ground site for the putrefaction of bodies, generally human, where formerly living tissue is left to decompose uncovered [sivathikā]| one day dead, two days dead, or three days dead, bloated, discolored, and decomposing, a bhikkhu |compares::likens; lit. brings near together [upasaṁharati]| this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’ Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, being eaten by crows, or hawks, or vultures, or herons, or dogs, or tigers, or leopards, or jackals, or by various kinds of creatures, a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’ Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood and held together by sinews, <collapse>a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’</collapse>

or a skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood and held together by sinews, <collapse>a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’</collapse>

or a skeleton devoid of flesh and blood and held together by sinews, <collapse>a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’</collapse>

or bones disconnected and scattered in all directions—here a hand bone, there a foot bone, there an ankle bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a pelvis bone, there a rib, here a spine, there a shoulder blade, here a neck bone, there a jawbone, here a tooth, and there a skull, a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’ Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, bones bleached white, the color of conch shells, <collapse>a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’</collapse>

or bones heaped up, having lain for more than a year, <collapse>a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’</collapse>

or bones that are rotten and reduced to dust, a bhikkhu compares this very body to it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.’

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

### 2. Observing the Felt Experience

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful felt experience, feeling, sensation; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself?

Here, bhikkhus, when experiencing a pleasant feeling, a bhikkhu discerns, ‘I am experiencing a pleasant feeling.’

When experiencing a painful feeling, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a painful feeling.’

When experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’

When experiencing a |worldly::of the flesh [sāmisa]| pleasant feeling, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a worldly pleasant feeling.’

When experiencing a pleasant feeling that is |free from worldly ties::free from sensual engagement, spiritual [nirāmisa]|, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a pleasant feeling that is free from worldly ties.’

When experiencing a worldly painful feeling, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a worldly painful feeling.’

When experiencing a painful feeling that is free from worldly ties, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a painful feeling that is free from worldly ties.’

When experiencing a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’

When experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling that is free from worldly ties, he discerns, ‘I am experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling that is free from worldly ties.’

Thus, he dwells observing the felt experience in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the felt experience externally, or he dwells observing the felt experience both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the felt experience, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the felt experience, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the felt experience.

The section on observing the felt experience is completed.

### 3. Observing the Mind

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the |mind::the faculty of thought and intention, often restless or wandering [citta]| in and of itself?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu discerns a mind |with passion::with lust, desire, infatuation [sarāga]| as ‘a mind with passion;’ discerns a mind |free from passion::without lust [vītarāga]| as ‘a mind free from passion;’ discerns a mind |with aversion::with hatred, with ill will [sadosa]| as ‘a mind with aversion;’ discerns a mind |free from aversion::free from hatred, free from ill will [vītadosa]| as ‘a mind free from aversion;’ discerns a |confused::befuddled, deluded [samoha]| mind as ‘a confused mind;’ discerns a mind |free from confusion::free from delusion [vītamoha]| as ‘a mind free from confusion;’ discerns a |dull::contracted, shrunk [saṅkhitta]| mind as ‘a dull mind;’ discerns a |scattered::distracted due to restlessness and worry [vikkhitta]| mind as ‘a scattered mind;’ discerns an |exalted::grand [mahaggata]| mind as ‘an exalted mind;’ discerns a mind that is not exalted as ‘a mind that is not exalted;’ discerns an |inferior::surpassable [sauttara]| mind as ‘an inferior mind;’ discerns an unsurpassed mind as ‘an unsurpassed mind;’ discerns a |collected::composed, settled [samāhita]| mind as ‘a collected mind;’ discerns a |distracted::not composed [asamāhita]| mind as ‘a distracted mind;’ discerns a |liberated::freed [vimutta]| mind as ‘a liberated mind;’ discerns a mind that is not liberated as ‘a mind that is not liberated.’

### 4. Observing the Mental Qualities

#### 4.1. Observing the Mental Qualities with regard to the Hindrances

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five hindrances. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five hindrances?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu discerns when there is |sensual desire::interest in sensual pleasure, sensual impulse [kāmacchanda]| present in him, ‘There is sensual desire in me,’ or when there is no sensual desire present, ‘There is no sensual desire in me,’ and he discerns how unarisen sensual desire can arise, how arisen sensual desire is abandoned, and how abandoned sensual desire does not arise again in the future.

He discerns when there is |ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construct fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]| present in him, ‘There is ill will in me,’ or when there is no ill will present, ‘There is no ill will in me,’ and he discerns how unarisen ill will can arise, how arisen ill will is abandoned, and how abandoned ill will does not arise again in the future.

He discerns when there is |dullness and drowsiness::lack of mental clarity or alertness, mental sluggishness, lethargy, sleepiness lit. stiffness (of mind/body due to tiredness) [thinamiddha]| present in him, ‘There is dullness and drowsiness in me,’ or when there is no dullness and drowsiness present, ‘There is no dullness and drowsiness in me,’ and he discerns how unarisen dullness and drowsiness can arise, how arisen dullness and drowsiness is abandoned, and how abandoned dullness and drowsiness do not arise again in the future.

He discerns when there is |restlessness and worry::agitation and edginess, distraction, fidgeting, fiddling, uneasiness [uddhaccakukkucca]| present in him, ‘There is restlessness and worry in me,’ or when there is no restlessness and worry present, ‘There is no restlessness and worry in me,’ and he discerns how unarisen restlessness and worry can arise, how arisen restlessness and worry is abandoned, and how abandoned restlessness and worry do not arise again in the future.

He knows when there is |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness wrt suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering [vicikiccha]| present in him, ‘There is doubt in me,’ or when there is no doubt present, ‘There is no doubt in me,’ and he knows how unarisen doubt can arise, how arisen doubt is abandoned, and how abandoned doubt does not arise again in the future.

Thus, he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves internally, or he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves externally, or he dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the mental qualities. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there are mental qualities’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five hindrances.

The section on the Hindrances is completed.

#### 4.2. Observing the Mental Qualities with regard to the Aggregates

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the |five aggregates that are subject to clinging::the physical and mental heaps that are appropriated, grasped at, or taken as self; the fivefold collection of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness bound up with attachment [pañca + upādānakkhandha]|. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five aggregates that are subject to being held onto as a self? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands: ‘Such is |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one’s body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]|, such is the arising of form, such is the |passing away::disappearance, vanishing, subsiding [atthaṅgama]| of form; such is felt experience, such is the arising of felt experience, such is the passing away of felt experience; such is |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks sensory information by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, such is the arising of perception, such is the passing away of perception; such are |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, choices; mental and bodily volitional activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); kamma-producing processes; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]|, such is the arising of intentional constructs, such is the passing away of intentional constructs; such is |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]|, such is the arising of consciousness, such is the passing away of consciousness;’

He dwells observing the arising nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the mental qualities. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there are mental qualities’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five aggregates that are subject to being held onto as a self.

The section on the Aggregates is completed.

#### 4.3. Observing the Mental Qualities with regard to the Sense Bases

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the six |internal and external::personal and other [ajjhattikabāhira]| sense bases. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves in the six internal and external sense bases?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu discerns the eye and |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]|, and the |fetter::chain, bond, link, thing which binds [saṃyojana]| that arises dependent on both; he also discerns how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen fetter, and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen fetter, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of the abandoned fetter.

He discerns the ear and |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]|, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he also discerns how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen fetter, and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen fetter, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of the abandoned fetter.

He discerns the nose and |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]|, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he also discerns how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen fetter, and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen fetter, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of the abandoned fetter.

He discerns the tongue and |tastes::flavors experienced through the tongue such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes like umami or astringency—any gustatory experience that can become an object of craving, indulgence, comfort, or sensory delight [rasā]|, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he also discerns how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen fetter, and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen fetter, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of the abandoned fetter.

He discerns the body and |tangible objects::tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]|, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he also discerns how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen fetter, and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen fetter, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of the abandoned fetter.

He discerns the mind and |mental objects::thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions, intentions, perceptions, concepts, beliefs, mental images, or constructs—any mental phenomena that arises internally and can become an object of clinging, identity, projection, craving, or aversion [dhammā]|, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he also discerns how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen fetter, and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen fetter, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of the abandoned fetter.

Thus, he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves internally, or he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves externally, or he dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the mental qualities. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there are mental qualities’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the six sense bases.

#### 4.4. Observing the Mental Qualities with regard to the Factors of Awakening

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the seven factors of awakening. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves in the seven factors of awakening?

Here, bhikkhus, when the |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]| is present within, a bhikkhu discerns, ‘The awakening factor of mindfulness is present in me,’ or when the awakening factor of mindfulness is not present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of mindfulness is not present in me.’ He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of mindfulness arises and how the arisen awakening factor of mindfulness reaches fulfillment through |cultivation::development, meditation [bhāvanā]|.

When the |awakening factor of investigation of states::the quality of discriminative investigation into states, mental qualities and other phenomena; analyzing the teaching as a factor of enlightenment; second of the seven awakening factors [dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga]| is present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of investigation of states is present in me,’ or when the awakening factor of investigation of states is not present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of investigation of states is not present in me.’ He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of investigation of states arises and how the arisen awakening factor of investigation of states reaches fulfillment through cultivation.

When the |awakening factor of energy::the quality of unrelenting effort, the sustaining power of persistence as a factor of enlightenment; third of the seven awakening factors [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]| is present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of energy is present in me,’ or when the awakening factor of energy is not present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of energy is not present in me.’ He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of energy arises and how the arisen awakening factor of energy reaches fulfillment through cultivation.

When the |awakening factor of joy::the quality of heartfelt gladness, spiritual rapture untainted by sensuality, as a factor of enlightenment; fourth of the seven awakening factors [pītisambojjhaṅga]| is present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of joy is present in me,’ or when the awakening factor of joy is not present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of joy is not present in me.’ He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of joy arises and how the arisen awakening factor of joy reaches fulfillment through cultivation.

When the |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]| is present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of tranquility is present in me,’ or when the awakening factor of tranquility is not present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of tranquility is not present in me.’ He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of tranquility arises and how the arisen awakening factor of tranquility reaches fulfillment through cultivation.

When the |awakening factor of collectedness::the quality of unification, stability, and deep stillness of the mind, as a factor of enlightenment; sixth of the seven awakening factors [samādhisambojjhaṅga]| is present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of collectedness is present in me,’ or when the awakening factor of collectedness is not present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of collectedness is not present in me.’ He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of collectedness arises and how the arisen awakening factor of collectedness reaches fulfillment through cultivation.

When the |awakening factor of equanimity::the quality of balanced observation, non-reactivity, and mental equipoise as a factor of enlightenment; seventh of the seven awakening factors [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]| is present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of equanimity is present in me,’ or when the awakening factor of equanimity is not present within, he discerns, ‘The awakening factor of equanimity is not present in me.’ He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of equanimity arises and how the arisen awakening factor of equanimity reaches fulfillment through cultivation.

Thus, he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves internally, or he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves externally, or he dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the mental qualities. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there are mental qualities’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the seven factors of awakening.

The section on the Factors of Awakening is completed.

#### 4.5. Observing the Mental Qualities with regard to the Four Noble Truths

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the Four Noble Truths.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the Four Noble Truths? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu discerns as it actually is, ‘This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,’ he discerns as it actually is, ‘This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,’ he discerns as it actually is, ‘This is the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|,’ and he discerns as it actually is, ‘This is the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.’

Thus, he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves internally, or he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves externally, or he dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the mental qualities. Or else, mindfulness that ‘there are mental qualities’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the Four Noble Truths.

The section on the Four Noble Truths is completed.

The Observations of the Mental Qualities are completed.

### Conclusion

Indeed, bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected: either |final knowledge [of the complete wearing away of the mental defilements]::spiritual insight; full awakening [aññā]| here and now, or, if there is any |residual clinging for existence::remnant of grasping for renewed becoming [upādisesa]|, the state of |non-returning::third stage of awakening where the five lower fetters are permanently dropped [anāgāmitā]|.

Let alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six years... five years... four years... three years... two years... one year... Let alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven months, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge of full awakening here and now or, if there is any residual clinging for existence, the state of non-returning. Let alone seven months, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six months... five months... four months... three months... two months... one month... half a month... Let alone half a month, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for one week, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge of full awakening here and now or, if there is any residual clinging for existence, the state of non-returning.”

'This is the direct way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of discomfort and distress, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of Nibbāna, namely the four establishments of mindfulness.’ Thus was it said, and in relation to this was it said.”

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
