commentary: |
    [1] Observing the body in and of itself internally refers to observing the breathing within. Observing the body in and of itself externally refers to observing the breathing occurring in the body of another. Regardless of the distinction of the internal or the external, the observations hold the same purpose of understanding the nature of the body. Similar also applies for observing the felt experience in and of itself internally or externally, the mind in and of itself internally or externally, and the mental qualities in and of themselves internally or externally.

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the land of the Kurus, in a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus."

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

"This is the direct way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of |discomfort and distress::physical pain and mental suffering [dukkhadomanassa]|, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|, namely the |four establishments of mindfulness::four foundations or objective domains of mindfulness that one gradually establishes and cultivates as a direct way of practice [cattāro + satipaṭṭhāna]|.

What are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world; he dwells observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; he dwells observing the mind in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; he dwells observing the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world.

### 1. Observing the Body

#### 1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing

How, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell |observing the body in and of itself::contemplating the body as a body [kāye kāyānupassī]|?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, aligns his body upright, and establishes mindfulness as first priority. Mindfully, he breathes in; mindfully, he breathes out.

Breathing in long, he |discerns::distinguishes, understands, knows clearly [pajānāti]|, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he discerns, 'I breathe out long';

breathing in short, he discerns, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he discerns, 'I breathe out short'.

He trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'.

He trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the |bodily constructions::bodily processes associated with breathing, specifically the in-and-out breath. It encompasses the physical movements and sensations that arise from the act of breathing. [kāyasaṅkhāra]|'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formations'.

Just as a skilled |turner::A turner is a craftsman who shapes objects, like wood or metal, using a tool called a lathe. They carefully control the turning process to make smooth, precise shapes [bhamakāra]| or his apprentice, when making a long turn discerns, 'I make a long turn', or making a short turn discerns, 'I make a short turn'; so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu discerns, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he discerns, 'I breathe out long'; breathing in short, he discerns, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he discerns, 'I breathe out short'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formations'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formations'.

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally [1]. He dwells observing the |arising::appearance, origination [samudaya]| nature in the body, or he dwells observing the |vanishing::disappearing [vaya]| nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on Mindfulness of Breathing is completed.

#### 1.2. Observing the Body in Postures

Again, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu discerns, 'I am walking'; when standing, he discerns, 'I am standing'; when sitting, he discerns, 'I am sitting'; when lying down, he discerns, 'I am lying down'; or however his body is disposed, he discerns it accordingly.

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on Postures is completed.

#### 1.3. Full Awareness in Observing the Body

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with |full awareness::clear comprehension [sampajāna]| when going forward and returning; who acts with full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts with full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts with full awareness in wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts with full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts with full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts with full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on full awareness is completed.

#### 1.4. Observing the Disagreeable in the Body

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu |reviews::considers, reflects [paccavekkhati]| this very body from the soles of the feet upwards and from the top of the hair downwards, bounded by skin and full of various impurities: 'In this body, there are hairs of the head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, |synovial fluid::oil of the joints [lasikā]|, and urine.'

Just as if, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grains, such as rice, barley, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyesight having opened it were to reflect, 'These are rice, these are barley, these are beans, these are peas, these are millet, these are white rice.'

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body from the soles of the feet upwards and from the top of the head downwards, surrounded by skin and filled with various kinds of impurity: 'In this body, there are hairs of the head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, |synovial fluid::oil of the joints [lasikā]|, and urine.'

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on attention to the disagreeable is completed.

#### 1.5. Observing the Elements in the Body

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body, however it is disposed, however it is placed, considering it in terms of the elements: 'In this body, there is the |earth element::whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]|, the |water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|, the |fire element::whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]|, and the |wind element::whatever internal or external that is airy, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [vāyodhātu]|.'

Just as if, bhikkhus, a skilled butcher or their apprentice, after slaughtering a cow at a crossroads, were to sit down and carve it into portions.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body, however it is disposed, however it is placed, considering it in terms of the elements: 'In this body, there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the wind element.'

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

The section on observing the elements in the body is completed.

#### 1.6. The Nine Charnel Ground Observations

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a |charnel ground::an above-ground site for the putrefaction of bodies, generally human, where formerly living tissue is left to decompose uncovered [sivathikā]| one day dead, two days dead, or three days dead, bloated, discolored, and decomposing. He brings this reflection back to his own body: 'This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.' Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery being eaten by crows, dogs, vultures, or various kinds of creatures. He brings this reflection back to his own body: 'This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.' Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might see a body discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews ...

or a skeleton smeared with remnants of flesh and blood, held together by sinews ...

or a skeleton devoid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews ...

or bones disconnected and scattered in all directions—here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a pelvis bone, there a rib, here a spine, there a shoulder blade, here a neck bone, there a jawbone, here a tooth, and there a skull. He brings this reflection back to his own body: 'This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.' Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world. In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself.

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might see a body discarded in a charnel ground, bones white in color, resembling shells …

or bones heaped together, having lain for more than a year …

or bones rotting and crumbling into dust. He brings this reflection back to his own body: 'This body too is of the same nature, it will become like that, it is not exempt from that fate.'

Thus, he dwells observing the body in and of itself internally, or he dwells observing the body externally, or he dwells observing the body both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the body, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the body, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the body. Or else, mindfulness that 'there is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

### 2. Observing the Felt Experience

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful felt experience, feeling, sensation; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself?

Here, bhikkhus, when experiencing a pleasant sensation, a bhikkhu discerns, 'I am experiencing a pleasant sensation.'

When experiencing a painful sensation, he discerns, 'I am experiencing a painful sensation.'

When experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant sensation, he discerns, 'I am experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant sensation.'

When experiencing a |worldly::of the flesh [sāmisa]| pleasant sensation, he discerns, 'I am experiencing a worldly pleasant sensation.'

When experiencing a pleasant sensation that is |free from worldly ties::free from sensual engagement, spiritual [nirāmisa]|, he discerns, 'I am experiencing a pleasant sensation that is free from worldly ties.'

### 3. Observing the Mind

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mind in and of itself?

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five aggregates that are subject to being held onto as a self? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands: 'Such is |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one's body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]|, such is the arising of form, such is the |passing away::disappearance, vanishing, subsiding [atthaṅgama]| of form; such is |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, such is the arising of felt experience, such is the passing away of felt experience; such is |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience.

#### 4.4. Observing the Mental Qualities with regard to the Factors of Awakening

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the seven factors of awakening. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves in the seven factors of awakening?

Here, bhikkhus, when the |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]| is present within, a bhikkhu discerns, 'The awakening factor of mindfulness is present in me,' or when the awakening factor of mindfulness is not present within, he discerns, 'The awakening factor of mindfulness is not present in me.'

He also discerns how the unarisen awakening factor of joy arises and how the arisen awakening factor of joy reaches fulfillment through cultivation.

When the |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]| is present within, he discerns, 'The awakening factor of tranquility is present in me,' or when the awakening factor of tranquility is not present within, he discerns, 'The awakening factor of tranquility is not present in me.'

Thus, he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves internally, or he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves externally, or he dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the mental qualities. Or else, mindfulness that 'there are mental qualities' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance.

#### 4.5. Observing the Mental Qualities with regard to the Four Noble Truths

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the Four Noble Truths.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the Four Noble Truths? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu discerns as it actually is, 'This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,' he discerns as it actually is, 'This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,' he discerns as it actually is, 'This is the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|,' and he discerns as it actually is, 'This is the |way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.'

Thus, he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves internally, or he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves externally, or he dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves both internally and externally. He dwells observing the arising nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing the vanishing nature in the mental qualities, or he dwells observing both the arising and vanishing nature in the mental qualities. Or else, mindfulness that 'there are mental qualities' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and remembrance. He dwells independently and does not cling to anything in the world.

In this way too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the Four Noble Truths.

The section on the Four Noble Truths is completed.

The Observations of the Mental Qualities are completed.

### Conclusion

Indeed, bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected: either |final knowledge::spiritual insight [aññā]| [of full awakening] here and now, or, if there is any |residual clinging for existence::remnant of grasping for renewed becoming [upādisesa]|, the state of |non-returning::third stage of awakening where the five lower fetters are permanently dropped [anāgāmitā]|.

Let alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six years... five years... four years... three years... two years... one year... Let alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven months, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge of full awakening here and now or, if there is any residual clinging for existence, the state of non-returning. Let alone seven months, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six months... five months... four months... three months... two months... one month... half a month... Let alone half a month, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for one week, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge of full awakening here and now or, if there is any residual clinging for existence, the state of non-returning."

'This is the direct way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of discomfort and distress, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of Nibbāna, namely the four establishments of mindfulness.' Thus was it said, and in relation to this was it said."

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words.
