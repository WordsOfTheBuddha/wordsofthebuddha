Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in the Eastern Park, at |Migāramātā’s mansion::name of a monastery outside Sāvatthī, built by Visākhā; lit. Migāra’s Mother’s Hall [migāramātupāsāda]|.

Now on that occasion, the Blessed One was seated in the open air, surrounded by the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus on the |Uposatha::Occurring on specific lunar days such as the full moon, new moon, and quarter moons, this is a time for renewing virtue, deepening practice, and purifying the mind. [uposatha]| day of the fifteenth, on the night of the full moon. Then, having surveyed the completely silent Saṅgha of bhikkhus, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, could a |person without integrity::unethical person, inferior person [asappurisa]| know a person without integrity: ‘This fellow is a person without integrity’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Good, bhikkhus. It is impossible, it cannot happen, that a person without integrity could recognize a person without integrity: ‘This fellow is a person without integrity.’ But, bhikkhus, could a person without integrity recognize a |person of integrity::virtuous person [sappurisa]|: ‘This fellow is a person of integrity’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Good, bhikkhus. This too is impossible, it cannot happen, that a person without integrity could recognize a person of integrity: ‘This fellow is a person of integrity.’ Bhikkhus, a person without integrity is possessed of bad qualities, associates with people without integrity, thinks unethical thoughts, counsels like a person without integrity, speaks unethically, acts in an unethical manner, holds views like a person without integrity, and gives gifts like a person without integrity.

And how, bhikkhus, is a person without integrity possessed of bad qualities? Here, bhikkhus, a person without integrity is |faithless::without confidence, without conviction [assaddha]|, |lacking sense of right and wrong::shamelessness, lacking conscience [ahirika]|, |morally reckless::fearless regarding wrongdoing, lacking prudence [anottappa]|, of |little learning::ignorant, uneducated [appassuta]|, |lazy::procrastinating, inactive person, indolent [kusīta]|, |muddle-minded::forgetful, not mindful [muṭṭhassatī]|, and |undiscerning::without wisdom [duppañña]|. That is how a person without integrity is possessed of bad qualities.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person without integrity associate with people without integrity? Here, bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who are faithless, lacking sense of right and wrong, morally reckless, of little learning, lazy, muddle-minded, and undiscerning—those are the ones the person without integrity has for his friends and his companions. That is how a person without integrity associates with people without integrity.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person without integrity think unethical thoughts? Here, bhikkhus, a person without integrity |intends::wills, thinks about [ceteti]| for his own |affliction::harm, injury [byābādha]|, intends for the affliction of another, and intends for the affliction of both. That is how a person without integrity thinks unethical thoughts.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person without integrity counsel like a person without integrity? Here, bhikkhus, a person without integrity counsels for his own affliction, counsels for the affliction of others, and counsels for the affliction of both. That is how a person without integrity counsels like a person without integrity.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person without integrity speak unethically? Here, bhikkhus, a person without integrity |speaks falsely::who lies [musāvādī]|, |speaks divisively::who separates others by speech, who sows discord [pisuṇavācā]|, |speaks harshly::who speak using rough words, rudely, or in an unkind manner [pharusavācā]|, and |chatters frivolously::who talk rubbish, who gossip [samphappalāpī]|. That is how a person without integrity speaks unethically.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person without integrity act in an unethical manner? Here, bhikkhus, a person without integrity kills living beings, takes what is not given, and engages in sexual misconduct. That is how a person without integrity acts in an unethical manner.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person without integrity hold views like a person without integrity? Here, bhikkhus, a person without integrity holds such a view: ‘There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no beings who are reborn spontaneously; no ascetics and brahmins in the world who are rightly practicing or have rightly practiced, and who, having realized for themselves by |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, declare this world and the other world.’ That is how a person without integrity holds views like a person without integrity.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person without integrity give gifts like a person without integrity? Here, bhikkhus, a person without integrity gives gifts |disrespectfully::carelessly, inattentively [asakkaccaṁ]|, |not with his own hand::impersonally, by proxy [asahatthā]|, gives what is to be |discarded::lit. thrown away [apaviddha]|, and gives |without regard for its future consequences::with no thought of the results [anāgamanadiṭṭhika]|. That is how a person without integrity gives gifts like a person without integrity.

That person without integrity, bhikkhus—being thus possessed of bad qualities, thus associating with people without integrity, thus thinking like a person without integrity, thus counseling like a person without integrity, thus speaking unethically, thus acting in an unethical manner, thus holding views like a person without integrity; having given gifts like a person without integrity—with the breakup of the body, after death, reappears in the destination of persons without integrity. And what, bhikkhus, is the destination of persons without integrity? |Hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]| or the animal realm.

Bhikkhus, could a person of integrity know a person of integrity: ‘This fellow is a person of integrity’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Good, bhikkhus. It is possible, it can happen, that a person of integrity could recognize a person of integrity: ‘This fellow is a person of integrity.’ But, bhikkhus, could a person of integrity recognize a person without integrity: ‘This fellow is a person without integrity’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

That is how a person of integrity is possessed of good qualities.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person of integrity associate with people of integrity? Here, bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who have faith, have a sense of right and wrong, have moral dread, are very learned, are energetic, are those who attend mindfully, and are wise—those are the ones the person without integrity has for his friends and his companions. That is how a person of integrity associates with people of integrity.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person of integrity think ethical thoughts? Here, bhikkhus, a person of integrity does not intend for his own affliction, does not intend for the affliction of others, and does not intend for the affliction of both. That is how a person of integrity thinks ethical thoughts.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person of integrity counsel like a person of integrity? Here, bhikkhus, a person of integrity does not counsel for his own affliction, does not counsel for the affliction of others, and does not counsel for the affliction of both.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person of integrity give gifts like a person of integrity? Here, bhikkhus, a person of integrity gives respectfully, gives with his own hand, gives considerately, gives what is not to be discarded, and gives with the view that something will come back.

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and pleased with the Blessed One’s words.
