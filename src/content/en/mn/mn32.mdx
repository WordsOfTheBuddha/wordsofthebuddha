Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at this Gosiṅga Sal wood park together with a large gathering of well-known elder disciples—namely, the venerable |Sāriputta::foremost disciple of the Buddha in great wisdom [sāriputta]|, the venerable |Mahāmoggallāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in psychic power; lit. Moggallāna the great [mahāmoggallāna]|, the venerable |Mahākassapa::foremost disciple of the Buddha in preaching ascetic practices; lit. Kassapa the great [mahākassapa]|, the venerable |Anuruddha::foremost disciple of the Buddha in divine eye; also a cousin of the Buddha [anuruddha]|, the venerable |Revata::Venerable Revata is regarded as the foremost disciple of the Buddha in forest dwelling [revata]|, the venerable |Ānanda::foremost disciple of the Buddha in great learning, remembrance, conduct, resoluteness and service [ānanda]|, and many other distinguished elder disciples.

Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mahāmoggallāna emerged from |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, went to the venerable Mahā Kassapa, and said to him: “Fried Kassapa, let us go to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|.”

“Yes, friend,” the venerable Mahākassapa replied. Then the venerable Mahāmoggallāna, the venerable Mahākassapa, and the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma.

The venerable Ānanda saw the venerables Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, and Anuruddha going to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma. Seeing this, he went to the Venerable Revata. Having drawn near, he said to him: “Friend Revata, those true men are going to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma. Let us also go to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma.” “Yes, friend,” the venerable Revata replied. Then the venerable Revata and the venerable Ānanda went to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma.

The venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Revata and the venerable Ānanda coming from afar and said to the venerable Ānanda: “Let the venerable Ānanda come, welcome to the venerable Ānanda, the Blessed One’s attendant, who is always in the Blessed One’s presence. Friend Ānanda, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the |Sal trees::a tall, majestic hardwood tree known for its strength, durability, and grandeur, Shorea robusta [sāla]| are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Ānanda, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?”

“Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is very learned, who remembers what he has learned, and one who |accumulates knowledge::stores up learning [sutasannicaya]|. Those teachings which are beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, of significance, well-phrased, |altogether complete::not missing in any way, not requiring further additions [kevalaparipuṇṇa]|, and |completely pure::bright, perfect [parisuddha]| — such teachings are well-learned by him, remembered, |practiced::rehearsed, consolidated, familiarized [paricita]|, |mentally recollected::reconsidered, rechecked, re-investigated [manasānupekkhita]|, and |thoroughly penetrated::completely understood [suppaṭividdha]| |by view::in concept, in theory, in attitude, in philosophy [diṭṭhi]|. And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the underlying tendencies. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.”

When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Revata thus: “Friend Revata, the venerable Ānanda has spoken according to his own |inspiration::eloquence, intuition, intelligence, wit [paṭibhāna]|. Now we ask the venerable Revata: ‘Friend Revata, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Revata, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’”

“Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu enjoys |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]| and is devoted to seclusion. He is devoted to internal tranquility of mind, |meditates with diligence::does not neglect meditation [anirākatajjhāna]|, is endowed with |insight::seeing clearly, penetrating internal vision [vipassanā]|, and practices in an |empty dwelling::uninhabited place, a physical home devoid of a self, e.g. a hut, a cave, forest [suññāgāra]|. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.”

When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus: “Friend Anuruddha, the venerable Revata has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Anuruddha: ‘Friend Anuruddha, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Anuruddha, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’”

“Here, friend Sāriputta, with the |divine eye::the faculty of clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the ordinary human range [dibbacakkhu]|, purified and surpassing human vision, a bhikkhu examines a thousand worlds. Just as, friend Sāriputta, a man with good eyesight standing on the top floor of a palace might look out over a thousand wheel rims [laid out on the ground], so too, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, a bhikkhu examines a thousand worlds. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.”

When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahākassapa thus: “Friend Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Mahākassapa: ‘Friend Kassapa, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Kassapa, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’”

“Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is a forest dweller himself and speaks in praise of forest dwelling; he lives on alms food and praises living on alms food; he wears robes made from discarded cloth and praises the use of rag robes; he keeps only three robes and praises that restraint. He has few wishes himself and speaks in praise of fewness of wishes; he is content himself and speaks in praise of contentment; he is secluded and praises seclusion; he is aloof and praises |non-association::aloofness, detachment, non-association [asaṃsagga]|. He is energetic himself and speaks in praise of |rousing of energy::taking initiative, making a mental decision to act [vīriyārambha]|; he is |accomplished in virtue::of excellent morality; accomplished in virtue [sīlasampanna]| and praises being accomplished in ethical conduct; he is |accomplished in collectedness::accomplished in stability of mind, skilled in mental stillness [samādhisampanna]| and praises being accomplished in collectedness; he is accomplished in |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]| and praises being accomplished in wisdom. He is accomplished in |liberation::release, deliverance, freedom, emancipation [vimutti]| and praises the attainment of libteration; he is accomplished in |knowledge and vision of liberation::understanding and realization of liberation, total understanding of emancipation [vimuttiñāṇadassana]| and praises the accomplishment of knowledge and vision of liberation. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.”

When this was said, he venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahāmoggallāna thus: “Friend Moggallāna, the venerable Mahākassapa has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Mahāmoggallāna: ‘Friend Moggallāna, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallāna, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’”

“Here, friend Sāriputta, two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the Dhamma and they question each other, and each being questioned by the other, respond without stumbling, and their conversation proceeds in accordance with the Dhamma. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.”

When this was said, the venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus: “Friend Sāriputta, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Sāriputta: ‘Friend Sāriputta, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’”

“Here, friend Moggallāna, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he does not let the mind wield mastery over him. With whichever |abiding or attainment::meditation attainment in which one lives, state of meditation in which one dwells [vihārasamāpatti]| he wishes to dwell in the morning, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells in the morning. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell at midday, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells at midday. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell in the evening, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells in the evening. Suppose, friend Moggallāna, a king or a royal minister had a wardrobe full of variously colored clothes. Whichever set of clothes he wished to wear in the morning, that very set of clothes he would wear in the morning. Whichever set of clothes he wished to wear at midday, that very set of clothes he would wear at midday. And whichever set of clothes he wished to wear in the evening, that very set of clothes he would wear in the evening.

So too, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he does not let the mind wield mastery over him. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell in the morning, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells in the morning. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell at midday, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells at midday. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell in the evening, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells in the evening. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallāna, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.”

Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed those venerable ones thus: “Friends, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration. Come, let us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. In whatever way the Blessed One will explain it, that is how we should remember it.”

“Yes, friend,” the venerables replied to the venerable Sāriputta. Then those venerables went to the Blessed One. Having bowed to him, they sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, here the venerables Revata and Ānanda came to me to listen to the Dhamma. I saw the venerables Revata and Ānanda coming from afar. Seeing them, I said to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Let the venerable Ānanda come, welcome to the venerable Ānanda, the Blessed One’s attendant, who is always in the Blessed One’s presence. Friend Ānanda, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Ānanda, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’ When this was said, venerable sir, the venerable Ānanda said to me: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is very learned, who remembers what he has learned, <collapse>and one who accumulates knowledge. Those teachings which are beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, of significance, well-phrased, altogether complete, and completely pure — such teachings are well-learned by him, remembered, practiced, mentally recollected, and thoroughly penetrated by view. And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the</collapse> underlying tendencies. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.’”

“Good, good, Sāriputta. Ānanda, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did. For Ānanda, Sāriputta, is very learned, who remembers what he has learned, and one who accumulates knowledge. Those teachings which are beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, of significance, well-phrased, altogether complete, and completely pure — such teachings are well-learned by him, remembered, practiced, mentally recollected, and thoroughly penetrated by view. And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the underlying tendencies.”

“When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Revata thus: ‘Friend Revata, the venerable Ānanda has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Revata: ‘Friend Revata, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend Revata, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’ When this was said, venerable sir, the venerable Revata said to me: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu enjoys seclusion and is devoted to seclusion. He is devoted to internal tranquility of mind, meditates with diligence, is endowed with insight, and practices in an empty dwelling. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.’”

“Good, good, Sāriputta. Revata, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did. For Revata, Sāriputta, enjoys seclusion and is devoted to seclusion. He is devoted to internal tranquility of mind, meditates with diligence, is endowed with insight, and practices in an empty dwelling.”

“When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus: ‘Friend Anuruddha, the venerable Revata <collapse>has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Anuruddha: ‘Friend Anuruddha, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air.</collapse> What kind of bhikkhu, friend Anuruddha, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’ When this was said, venerable sir, the venerable Anuruddha said to me: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, a bhikkhu examines a thousand worlds. Just as, friend Sāriputta, a man with good eyesight <collapse>standing on the top floor of a palace might look out over a thousand wheel rims [laid out on the ground], so too, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, a bhikkhu examines a thousand worlds.</collapse> That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.’”

“Good, good, Sāriputta. Anuruddha, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did. For with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, Anuruddha examines a thousand worlds.”

“When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Mahākassapa thus: ‘Friend Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Mahākassapa <collapse>‘Friend Kassapa, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air.</collapse> What kind of bhikkhu, friend Kassapa, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’ When this was said, venerable sir, the venerable Mahākassapa said to me: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, a bhikkhu is a forest dweller himself and speaks in praise of forest dwelling; he lives on alms food and praises living on alms food; he wears robes made from discarded cloth and praises the use of rag robes; he keeps only three robes and praises that restraint. He has few wishes himself and speaks in praise of fewness of wishes; he is content himself and speaks in praise of contentment; he is secluded and praises seclusion; he is aloof and praises non-association. He is energetic himself and speaks in praise of rousing of energy; he is accomplished in virtue and praises being accomplished in ethical conduct; he is accomplished in collectedness and praises being accomplished in collectedness; he is accomplished in wisdom and praises being accomplished in wisdom. He is accomplished in liberation and praises the attainment of libteration; he is accomplished in knowledge and vision of liberation and praises the accomplishment of knowledge and vision of liberation. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.’”

“Good, good, Sāriputta. Kassapa, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did. For Kassapa, Sāriputta, is a forest dweller himself and speaks in praise of forest dwelling; he lives on alms food and praises living on alms food; he wears robes made from discarded cloth and praises the use of rag robes; he keeps only three robes and praises that restraint. He has few wishes himself and speaks in praise of fewness of wishes; he is content himself and speaks in praise of contentment; he is secluded and praises seclusion; he is aloof and praises non-association.

He is accomplished in liberation and praises the attainment of libteration; he is accomplished in knowledge and vision of liberation and praises the accomplishment of knowledge and vision of liberation.”

“When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Mahāmoggallāna thus: ‘Friend Moggallāna, the venerable Mahākassapa has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Mahāmoggallāna: <collapse>‘Friend Moggallāna, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air.</collapse> What kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallāna, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park?’ When this was said, venerable sir, the venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to me: ‘Here, friend Sāriputta, two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the Dhamma and they question each other, and each being questioned by the other, respond without stumbling, and their conversation proceeds in accordance with the Dhamma.

“Good, good, Sāriputta. Moggallāna, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did. For Moggallāna, Sāriputta, is one who talks on the Dhamma.”

When this was said, venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the Blessed One: “Then, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus: ‘Friend Sāriputta, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Sāriputta: ‘Friend Sāriputta, this Gosiṅga Sal wood park is delightful, the night is moonlit, the Sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air.

With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell in the evening, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells in the evening. That kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallāna, could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.’”

“Good, good, Moggallāna. Sāriputta, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did. For Sāriputta, Moggallāna, wields mastery over his mind, he does not let the mind wield mastery over him. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell in the morning, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells in the morning. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell at midday, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells at midday. With whichever abiding or attainment he wishes to dwell in the evening, with that very abiding or attainment he dwells in the evening.”

When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, which of us has spoken well?”

“You have all spoken well, Sāriputta, each in your own way. Hear also from me what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park. Here, Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu has returned from his alms round, after his meal, he sits down cross-legged, keeping his body upright, establishing mindfulness as first priority, |determining::intending [paṇidhāya]|: ‘I shall not break this sitting position until through not clinging, my mind is liberated from the [mental] defilements.’ That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosiṅga Sal wood park.”

The Blessed One said this. The venerables were delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
