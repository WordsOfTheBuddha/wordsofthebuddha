title: Cūḷasāropama sutta - The Shorter Discourse on the Simile of the Heartwood
description: When questioned about rival teachers, the Buddha sets the debate aside to explain the true purpose of the spiritual life through the simile of the heartwood. He cautions that settling for fame, ethical conduct, or lesser meditative states is like mistaking branches or bark for the core. The ultimate goal remains the unshakeable liberation of mind.

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Then the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha approached the Blessed One; having drawn near, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After the exchange of courteous and polite conversation, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha said this to the Blessed One:

“Sir Gotama, there are those ascetics and brahmins who are leaders of communities, heads of groups, renowned, famous, founders of sects, and honored by the multitudes—namely Purāṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta—have they all had direct knowledge as they claim, or have none of them had direct knowledge, or have some of them had direct knowledge and some not?”

“Enough, brahmin, leave that aside. Whether they all had direct knowledge as they claim, or none of them had direct knowledge, or some of them had direct knowledge and some not. I will teach you the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, brahmin. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Very well, sir,” the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Suppose, brahmin, a man desiring heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, were to come upon a great tree standing possessed of heartwood. But bypassing the heartwood, passing over the sapwood, passing over the bark, passing over the dry outer bark, he cuts off and takes the branches and leaves, departing with the thought, ‘This is the heartwood.’ Then a man with good sight, seeing him, might say: ‘Surely this good man did not know the heartwood, nor the sapwood, nor the bark, nor the dry outer bark, nor the branches and leaves. For although he was desiring heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, he went right past the heartwood, past the sapwood, past the bark, past the dry outer bark, and having cut off and taken the branches and leaves, he departed, thinking, “This is the heartwood.” Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwood, his aim will not be accomplished.’

In the same way, brahmin, here a certain person goes forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness with the thought: ‘I am |immersed in::afflicted with [otiṇṇa]| birth, aging, and death; in sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; I am immersed in |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering |can be discerned::can become evident [paññāyetha]|.’ When he has gone forth thus, he acquires |acquisitions, respect, and popularity::gains or possessions, honor or reverence, and fame or praise [lābhasakkārasiloka]|. |Delighted::pleased [attamana]| with those acquisitions, respect, and popularity, his intention is fulfilled. He exalts himself on account of them and disparages others thus: ‘I am one with acquisitions, respect, and popularity; these other bhikkhus are unknown and insignificant.’ And whatever other states are higher and more sublime than acquisitions, respect, and popularity, he does not generate desire or make an effort to realize them, and he becomes sluggish and |careless::loose, lethargic, lax [sāthalika]|. Suppose, brahmin, a man desiring heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, were to come upon a great tree standing possessed of heartwood. But bypassing the heartwood, passing over the sapwood, passing over the bark, passing over the dry outer bark, and having cut off and taken the branches and leaves, he departed, thinking, ‘This is the heartwood.’ Whatever he had to make with heartwood, his aim will not be accomplished. I say this person is like that.

And whatever other states are higher and more sublime than acquisitions, respect, and popularity, he generates desire and makes an effort to realize them, and he does not become sluggish or careless. He succeeds in the |accomplishment of ethical conduct::attainment of virtue [sīlasampadā]|. Delighted with that accomplishment of ethical conduct, his intention is fulfilled. He exalts himself on account of it and disparages others thus: ‘I am |virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]| and of good character; these other bhikkhus are |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]| and of bad character.’ And whatever other states are higher and more sublime than the accomplishment of ethical conduct, he does not generate desire or make an effort to realize them, and he becomes sluggish and careless.

And what, brahmin, are the states higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision?

Here, brahmin, a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. This state, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy, the bhikkhu dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, mindful and clearly aware, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the abandoning of [bodily] pleasure and |pain::discomfort, unpleasantness. In this context, this is referring to bodily pain or sharp sensations. [dukkha]|, and with the prior settling down of |mental pleasure and displeasure::the duality of positive and negative states of mind; mental happiness and mental pain [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of mindfulness through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the complete surpassing of |perceptions of form::recognition of matter, concept of materiality [rūpasaññā]|, with the disappearance of |perception of sensory impact::recognition of sense impression, aversion; lit. striking against perception [paṭighasaññā]|, and non-attention to |perception of diversity::recognition of diversity, perception of multiplicity [nānattasaññā]|, the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of boundless space::field of boundless expanse, sometimes translated as dimension of infinite space [ākāsānañcāyatana]|, aware that ‘space is boundless.’ This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless space, aware that ‘consciousness is boundless,’ the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of boundless consciousness::field of limitless awareness [viññāṇañcāyatana]|. This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of nothingness::cosmological counterpart of the field of awareness centered on the absence of any distinct “something" to grasp or hold onto [ākiñcaññāyatana]|. This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the complete surpassing of the base of nothingness, the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|. This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Furthermore, brahmin, with the complete surpassing of the base of neither perception nor non-perception, the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |cessation of perception and what is felt::ending of recognition and felt experience, cessation of conception and what is felt [saññāvedayitanirodha]|. And seeing with wisdom, his |mental defilements::mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]| are completely exhausted. This state too, brahmin, is higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision. These, brahmin, are the states that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.

Suppose, brahmin, a man desiring heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, were to come upon a great tree standing possessed of heartwood. And having cut off and taken the heartwood itself, he departed, knowing, ‘This is the heartwood.’ Whatever he had to make with heartwood, his aim will be accomplished. I say this person is like that.

So this |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]|, brahmin, is not for the sake of acquisitions, respect, and popularity, nor for the sake of accomplishment of ethical conduct, nor for the sake of accomplishment of collectedness, nor for the sake of knowledge and vision. Rather, brahmin, it is this |unshakeable::unassailable, indisputable [akuppa]| |liberation of mind::emancipated by mind/heart, samādhi obtained from fruition [cetovimutti]| that is the purpose of the spiritual life, its heartwood, and its end.”

When this was said, the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, sir Gotama! Excellent, sir Gotama! <collapse>Just as if one might set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way, sir Gotama, the Dhamma has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by you in many ways. I go for refuge to venerable Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus.</collapse> May venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life.”
