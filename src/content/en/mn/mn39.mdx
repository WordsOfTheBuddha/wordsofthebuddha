Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the Anga country, in a market town of the Angans called Assapura. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“People recognize you as ‘ascetics, ascetics,’ bhikkhus. But when asked ‘Who are you?' you reply ‘We are ascetics.’

#### Training Guidelines

For you, bhikkhus, being recognized and acknowledging yourselves in this way, it should be understood that ‘We will undertake and practice those things that lead to being an ascetic and a Brahmin, so that our recognition and acknowledgment will be true and factual. And for us, consuming the requisites such as robes, alms food, lodgings, and medical supplies, this conduct will bring great benefit and great merit, and our going forth will not be in vain but fruitful and successful.’ Thus, bhikkhus, you should train.

And what, bhikkhus, are the dhammas that lead to being an ascetic and a Brahmin? ‘We will be endowed with a |sense of right and wrong::sense of shame, conscience, modesty [hirī]| and have |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]|.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

##### Conduct By Body, Speech, and Mind

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘Our bodily conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure bodily conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct is pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘Our verbal conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure verbal conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct and verbal conduct are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘Our mental conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure mental conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

##### Livelihood

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘Our livelihood will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure livelihood, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, and livelihood are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

##### Guarding the Sense Faculties

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘We will guard the doors of our sense faculties. Upon seeing a form with the eye, we will not |grasp at its prominent features::focusing on its external characteristics [nimittaggāhī]| nor be |enticed by the details::focusing on the secondary characteristics [anubyañjanaggāhī]|. Since if we left the eye faculty unguarded, |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| states of |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| might invade us, we will practice its restraint, guard the eye faculty, achieve restraint over the eye faculty. Upon hearing a sound with the ear ... upon smelling an odor with the nose ... upon tasting a flavor with the tongue ... upon touching a tangible object with the body ... upon cognizing a |mental object::a mind object such as a thought, idea, memory, intention, emotion, image, or concept arising within the mind that becomes the object of awareness, reflection, craving, or aversion [dhamma]| with the mind, we will not grasp at its prominent features nor be enticed by the details. Since if we left the mind faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might invade us, we will practice its restraint, guard the mind faculty, achieve restraint over the mind faculty.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, livelihood are pure, and we guard the doors of our sense faculties; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

##### Moderation in Eating

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘We will be moderate in eating, wisely reflecting on the food we consume, not for fun, not for pleasure, not for fattening, not for beautification, but only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body, for keeping it healthy, for helping with the spiritual life, thinking thus: ‘I will terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I will be healthy and blameless and live in comfort.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, livelihood are pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

##### Wakefulness

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘We will be devoted to |wakefulness::lucidity, being awake, being alert [jāgariya]|. During the day, we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states. During the first watch of the night [dusk to 10 PM], we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states. During the middle watch of the night [10 PM to 2 AM], we will lie down on the right side in the posture of a lion, stacking one foot over the other, maintaining mindfulness and alertness, keeping in mind the intention to |awaken::whether spontaneously or at a predetermined time|. In the last watch of the night [2 AM to dawn], upon rising, we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think: ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct is pure, our verbal conduct is pure, our mental conduct is pure, our livelihood is pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

##### Mindfulness and Full Awareness

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? ‘We will be equipped with |mindfulness::clear comprehension and full awareness of body, felt experiences, mind, and mental qualities. Read about the way of practice leading to its comprehensive development in [MN 10 - Satipaṭṭhānasutta - Establishments of Mindfulness](/mn10) discourse [sati]| and |full awareness::attentiveness, clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]|. When going forward and returning, we will act with full awareness. When looking ahead and looking away, we will act with full awareness. When flexing and extending our limbs, we will act with full awareness. In wearing our robes and carrying our outer robe and bowl, we will act with full awareness. When eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting, we will act with full awareness. In defecating and urinating, we will act with full awareness. When walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent, we will act with full awareness.’ This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think: ‘We are endowed with a sense of right and wrong and have fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct is pure, our verbal conduct is pure, our mental conduct is pure, our livelihood is pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, equipped with mindfulness and full awareness; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,’ and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: ‘Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.’

And bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells in a secluded lodging — in the forest, at the foot of a tree, on a mountain, in a ravine, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest thicket, in the open air, on a heap of straw.

#### Five Hindrances

After the meal, having returned from alms-round, a bhikkhu sits down cross-legged, keeping his body upright, establishing mindfulness as the first priority. He gives up |craving::greediness, wanting, yearning [abhijjhā]| for the world, purifying his mind of craving; gives up |ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construction fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]| and abides with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the well-being of all breathing beings, purifying his mind of |ill will and hatred::enmity and aversion [byāpādapadosa]|. He gives up |dullness and drowsiness::lack or mental clarity or alertness, mental sluggishness, lethargy, sleepiness lit. stiffness (of mind/body due to tiredness) [thinamiddha]|, and abides free from dullness and drowsiness, |perceptive of light::aware of brightness [ālokasaññī]|, |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]| and |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]|, purifying his mind of dullness and drowsiness. He gives up |restlessness and worry::agitation and edginess, distraction, fidgeting, fiddling, uneasiness [uddhaccakukkucca]|, and abides unagitated, with an inwardly peaceful mind, purifying his mind of restlessness and worry. He gives up |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness [vicikiccha]|, and abides having crossed beyond doubt, without doubt about wholesome states, purifying his mind from doubt.


Just as a person, bhikkhus, might take a loan to invest in a business. And that business succeeds. He would then repay his old debts and still have some profit left over for his family. He would think: ‘Before, I took a loan to invest in a business, and that business succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and still have some profit left over for supporting my family.’ He would then be glad and full of joy.

Just as a person, bhikkhus, who was sick, in pain, and seriously ill, and his food did not nourish him, and his body had no strength. Then later on he recovers from that illness, his food nourishes him, and he regains strength in his body. He would think: ‘Before, I was sick, in pain, and seriously ill, my food did not nourish me, and my body had no strength. Now, I have recovered from that illness, my food nourishes me, and I have regained strength in my body.’ He would then be glad and full of joy.

Just as a person, bhikkhus, who was imprisoned. Then later on he is released from prison, safe and secure, without any loss of his belongings. He would think: ‘Before, I was imprisoned, now I have been released from prison, safe and secure, without any loss of my belongings.’ He would then be glad and full of joy.

Just as a person, bhikkhus, who was a slave, not free, dependent on others, unable to go where he wants. Then later on he is freed from slavery, becomes independent, not dependent on others, free to go where he wants. He would think: ‘Before, I was a slave, not free, dependent on others, unable to go where I want. Now, I am freed from slavery, independent, not dependent on others, free to go where I want.’ He would then be glad and full of joy.

Just as a person, bhikkhus, with wealth and possessions would travel through a dangerous path. Then later on he gets through that dangerous path safely, securely, without any loss of his belongings. He would think: ‘Before, with wealth and possessions, I traveled through a dangerous path. Now, I have gotten through that dangerous path safely, securely, without any loss of my belongings.’ He would then be glad and full of joy.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees these five hindrances in himself as if they were a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, a dangerous path. And when these five hindrances are abandoned, he sees himself as free from debt, healthy, released from prison, free from slavery, in a place of safety.

#### Four Jhānas

##### First Jhāna

Having abandoned these five hindrances, impediments to the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and is |imbued with joyful pleasure::imbued with joy and happiness, with delight and ease, sometimes experienced as an intense joy or pleasure, rapture [pītisukha]|. He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by the joyful pleasure born of seclusion. Just as a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice might knead bathing powder in a bronze bowl, sprinkling water again and again until the lump becomes permeated with moisture, saturated inside and out, yet does not drip.

In the same way, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by the joyful pleasure born of seclusion.

##### Second Jhāna

Furthermore, bhikkhus, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with joyful pleasure. He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of collectedness, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by joyful pleasure born of collectedness. Just as a deep lake fed by an underground spring—with no inflow from east, west, north, or south, and no rainclouds showering water—would have cool streams welling up from within to thoroughly suffuse, pervade, fill, and permeate the entire lake, leaving no part uncovered by cool water.

In the same way, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with the joyful pleasure born of collectedness, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by joyful pleasure born of collectedness.

##### Third Jhāna

Furthermore, bhikkhus, with the fading away of joyful pleasure, the bhikkhu dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, equanimous, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |ease::comfort, contentedness, happiness, pleasure [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with ease devoid of joyful pleasure, so that there is no part of his entire body that is not suffused with ease devoid of joyful pleasure. Just as, bhikkhus, in a pond of blue, red, or white lotuses, some lotuses born in the water grow entirely submerged, and remain nourished from within by cool water that thoroughly suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates them from their tips to their roots, leaving no part untouched by cool water.

In the same way, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with ease devoid of joyful pleasure, so that there is no part of his body that is not suffused with ease devoid of joyful pleasure.

##### Fourth Jhāna

Furthermore, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of ease and |discontentment::discomfort, unpleasantness, something unsatisfactory, stress [dukkha]|, and with the settling down of |joy and sorrow::craving and aversion, pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, gladness and dejection, positive state of mind and negative state of mind [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with a purified and clear mind, so that there is no part of his body that is not suffused by this purified and clear mind. Just as, bhikkhus, a person covered from head to toe in a spotless white cloth with no part of his body uncovered.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sits pervading this very body with a pure mind, so purified and clarified, that there is no part of his whole body not pervaded by the pure mind.

#### Three Knowledges

Thus with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, <collapse>three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many |aeon::lifespan of a world system, a vast cosmic time span [kappa]|s of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.’</collapse> Thus with their aspects and particulars, he recollects his manifold past lives. Just as a man might go from his own village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village return to his own village. He remembers, ‘I went from my own village to that village, there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way; from that village I went to yet another village ... and from that village I have returned to my own.’

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives, with their aspects and particulars.

Thus, with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, malleable, flexible, suitable for use, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the passing away and reappearing of beings. With the |divine eye::the faculty of clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the ordinary human range [dibbacakkhu]|, which is purified and surpassing human vision, he sees beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in fortunate and unfortunate destinations—and he understands how beings fare |according to their kamma::in line with their actions [yathākammūpaga]|: <collapse>‘These beings, who engaged in bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong view, and undertook actions under the influence of |wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|—upon the breakup of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a bad destination, a place of ruin, even in hell. But these beings, who engaged in good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, who did not revile the Noble Ones, held right view, and undertook actions under the influence of |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|—upon the breakup of the body, after death, have arisen in a good destination, the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpassing human vision, he sees beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in fortunate and unfortunate destinations—and he understands how beings fare according to their kamma.</collapse> Just as if there were two houses with doors, and a man with good eyesight standing between them could see people coming into and going out of the houses, walking around and roaming inside.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understands beings according to their actions.

Thus, with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the ending of the |taints::defilements, pollutants [āsava]|. He understands as it actually is, ‘This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,’ he understands as it actually is, ‘This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,’ he understands as it actually is, ‘This is the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|,’ he understands as it actually is, ‘This is the |way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.’ He understands as it actually is, ‘These are the taints,’ he understands as it actually is, ‘This is the arising of taints,’ he understands as it actually is, ‘This is the ending of taints,’ he understands as it actually is, ‘This is the way of practice leading to the ending of taints.’ Knowing and seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, the taint of becoming, and the taint of |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|. In liberation, there arises the knowledge: ‘Liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.’

Just as, bhikkhus, in a mountain lake that is deep, clear and undisturbed, a person with good eyesight standing on the shore can see shells, gravel, pebbles, and also fish swimming about or resting, and it would occur to him, ‘This mountain lake is deep, clear, and undisturbed. Here are these shells, gravel, pebbles, and also these fish swimming about or resting.’

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it actually is, ‘This is suffering, this is the arising of suffering, this is the ending of suffering, and this is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering. These are the taints, this is the arising of taints, this is the ending of taints, and this is the way of practice leading to the ending of taints.’ Understanding thus, he realizes, ‘there is no more coming to any state of existence.’

This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who is thus a ‘ascetic’, a ‘brahmin’, a ‘bathed one’, a ‘knower of the vedas’, a ‘well-learned one’, a ‘noble one’, an ‘arahant’.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become an ‘ascetic’? When he has calmed down |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]|, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a ‘ascetic’.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a ‘brahmin’? When he has expelled harmful, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a ‘brahmin’.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a ‘bathed one’? When he has bathed away harmful, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a ‘bathed one’.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a ‘knower of the vedas’? When he has understood harmful, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a ‘knower of the vedas’.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a ‘well-learned one’? When he has washed away harmful, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a ‘well-learned one’.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a ‘noble one’? When he is purified from harmful, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a ‘noble one’.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become an ‘arahant’? When he is completely purified from harmful, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes an ‘arahant’.

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
