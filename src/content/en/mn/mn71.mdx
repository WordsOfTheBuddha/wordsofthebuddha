Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Vesāli::capital of the Licchavīs [vesālī]|, in the |Great Forest::name of a forest outside Vesāli; lit. great forest [mahāvana]|, in the hall with the peaked roof.

At that time, the wanderer Vacchagotta was staying in the |Single White Lotus::(comm) one lotus with less than one hundred petals; one fragrant mango tree; single white mango [ekapuṇḍarīka]| wanderers’ park.

Then the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, took his alms bowl and outer robe, and entered Vesāli for alms. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “It is still too early to walk for alms in Vesāli. What if I go to the Single White Lotus wanderers’ park, where the wanderer Vacchagotta is?” Then the Blessed One went to the Single White Lotus wanderers’ park, where the wanderer Vacchagotta was.

The wanderer Vacchagotta saw the Blessed One coming from afar. Having seen the Blessed One, he said this: “Let the Blessed One come, venerable sir. Welcome to the Blessed One. It has been a long time since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come here. Let the Blessed One sit; this seat is prepared.”

The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. The wanderer Vacchagotta took a low seat and sat to one side. Seated to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta said this to the Blessed One:

“I have heard this, venerable sir: ‘The ascetic Gotama is |omniscient::all-knowing, with complete understanding [sabbaññū]| and |all-seeing::who perceives everything [sabbadassāvī]| and claims to have complete knowledge and vision thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or asleep or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me.”’ Venerable sir, do those who say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have complete knowledge and vision thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or asleep or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me,”’ state what has been said by the Blessed One, and not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is untrue? Do they explain in accordance with the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, and does no reasonable consequence of their statement afford grounds for criticism?”

“Vaccha, those who say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have complete knowledge and vision thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or asleep or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me,”’ do not state what has been said by me, and they misrepresent me with what is untrue.”

“But answering how, venerable sir, would we state what has been said by the Blessed One, and not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is untrue? How would we explain in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no reasonable consequence of our statement would afford grounds for criticism?”

“Vaccha, answering: ‘The ascetic Gotama possesses the three true knowledges,’ one would state what has been said by me, and not misrepresent me with what is untrue. One would explain in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no reasonable consequence of their statement would afford grounds for criticism.

For, Vaccha, whenever I wish, I recollect my manifold past lives, that is: one birth, two births, <collapse> three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many |aeon::lifespan of a world system, a vast cosmic time span [kappa]|s of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.’</collapse> Thus I recollect my manifold past lives with their aspects and in detail.

For, Vaccha, whenever I wish, with the |divine eye::the faculty of clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the ordinary human range [dibbacakkhu]|, purified and surpassing the human ability, I see beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in fortunate and unfortunate destinations<collapse>—and I understood how beings fare according to their kamma: ‘These beings, who engaged in bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong view, and undertook actions under the influence of |wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|—upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a bad destination, a place of ruin, even in hell. But these beings, who engaged in good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, who did not revile the Noble Ones, held right view, and undertook actions under the influence of |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|—upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a good destination, the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—</collapse>and I understand how beings fare |according to their kamma::in line with their actions [yathākammūpaga]|.

For, Vaccha, with the |wearing away of the taints::gradual exhaustion and elimination of the mental defilements or deep-seated afflictions such as sensual desire, craving for existence, views, and ignorance [āsava + khaya]|, I have realized for myself in this very life, with direct knowledge, the taintless |liberation of mind::emancipated by mind/heart, samādhi obtained from fruition [cetovimutti]| and |liberation by wisdom::emancipation by insight [paññāvimutti]|, and having realized it, I dwell in it.

Vaccha, answering: ‘The ascetic Gotama possesses the three true knowledges,’ one would state what has been said by me, and not misrepresent me with what is untrue. One would explain in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no reasonable consequence of their statement would afford grounds for criticism.”

When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: “Sir Gotama, is there any |layperson::householder [gihī]| who, without abandoning the |fetter to laylife::bond to being a householder [gihisaṁyojana]|, makes an end of suffering upon the breakup of the body?”

“There is no layperson, Vaccha, who, without abandoning the fetter to laylife, makes an end of suffering upon the breakup of the body.”

“But is there, Sir Gotama, any layperson who, without abandoning the fetter to laylife, goes to |heaven::a place of happiness, lit. good fortune [sagga]| upon the breakup of the body?”

“Vaccha, there are not only one hundred or two or three or four or five hundred, but even more laypersons who, without abandoning the fetter to laylife, go to heaven upon the breakup of the body.”

“Is there, Sir Gotama, any |Ājīvaka::A contemporary movement during the lifetime of the Buddha that professed that all events unfold by fixed cosmic destiny and actions have no consequences. [ājīvaka]| who has made an end of suffering upon the breakup of the body?”

“There is no Ājīvaka, Vaccha, who has made an end of suffering upon the breakup of the body.”

“But is there, Sir Gotama, any Ājīvaka who has gone to heaven upon the breakup of the body?”

“When I recollect the past ninety-one aeons, Vaccha, I do not recall any Ājīvaka who has gone to heaven with one exception, and he was a proponent of actions having consequences and a proponent of the efficacy of deeds.”

“If that is so, sir Gotama, then that sectarian institution is empty even of a single person going to heaven.”

“So it is, Vaccha, that sectarian institution is empty even of one going to heaven.”

The Blessed One said this. The wanderer Vacchagotta was delighted and pleased with the Blessed One’s words.
