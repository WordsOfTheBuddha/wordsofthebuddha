Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the land of the Kurus, in a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, sensual pleasures are |impermanent::not lasting, transient, unreliable [anicca]|, |hollow::empty, with nothing inside [tuccha]|, false, |deceptive::false, lit. untrue nature [mosadhamma]|. They are |created by illusion::made of magic, imaginary [māyākata]|, the prattle of fools. Whatever sensual pleasures there are concerning this life, and whatever sensual pleasures there are in the next life; whatever perception of sensuality there is in this life, and whatever perception of sensuality there is in the next life—both alike are Māra’s realm, Māra’s domain, Māra’s bait, Māra’s hunting ground. On account of them, these harmful, unwholesome mental states such as |intense longing::wishing for, wanting, longing for, insatiability [abhijjhati]|, |ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construct fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]|, and |aggressiveness::hostile or violent behavior towards living beings [sārambha]| arise. And they become an obstacle for a disciple of the Noble Ones training here.

### The Imperturbable

There, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones reflects thus: ‘Whatever sensual pleasures there are concerning this life, and whatever sensual pleasures there are in the next life; whatever perception of sensuality there is in this life, and whatever perception of sensuality there is in the next life—both alike are Māra’s realm, Māra’s domain, Māra’s bait, Māra’s hunting ground. On account of them, these harmful, unwholesome mental states such as intense longing, ill will, and aggressiveness arise. And they become an obstacle for a disciple of the Noble Ones training here. Suppose I were to dwell with a mind that is abundant and exalted, having surpassed the world and made a firm determination with the mind. For as I dwell with a mind that is abundant and exalted, having surpassed the world and made a firm determination with the mind, these harmful, unwholesome mental states such as intense longing, ill will, and aggressiveness would not arise. And with the abandoning of them, my mind will be vast, |boundless::limitless, immeasurable [appamāṇa]|, and |well cultivated::fully developed [subhāvita]|.’

When he practices in this way and dwells thus often, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the |imperturbable::fourth jhāna; lit. not moving state [āneñja]| now or resolves upon it with wisdom. With the breakup of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness may pass on [to rebirth] in the imperturbable. This, bhikkhus, is said to be the first way of practice conducive to the imperturbable.

Again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones reflects thus: ‘Whatever sensual pleasures there are concerning this life, and whatever sensual pleasures there are in the next life; whatever perception of sensuality there is in this life, and whatever perception of sensuality there is in the next life—whatever |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one’s body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]| there is, all form is the four great elements and form derived from the four great elements.’ When he practices in this way and dwells thus often, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the imperturbable now or resolves upon it with wisdom. With the breakup of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness may pass on [to rebirth] in the imperturbable. This, bhikkhus, is said to be the second way of practice conducive to the imperturbable.

Again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones reflects thus: ‘Whatever sensual pleasures there are concerning this life, and whatever sensual pleasures there are in the next life; whatever perception of sensuality there is in this life, and whatever perception of sensuality there is in the next life; whatever forms there are in this life, and whatever forms there are in the next life; whatever perception of form there is in this life, and whatever perception of form there is in the next life—both of these are impermanent. What is impermanent is not worth delighting in, not worth welcoming, not worth clinging to.’ When he practices in this way and dwells thus often, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the imperturbable now or resolves upon it with wisdom. With the breakup of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness may pass on [to rebirth] in the imperturbable. This, bhikkhus, is said to be the third way of practice conducive to the imperturbable.

### Base of Nothingness

Again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones reflects thus: ‘Whatever sensual pleasures there are concerning this life, and whatever sensual pleasures there are in the next life; whatever perception of sensuality there is in this life, and whatever perception of sensuality there is in the next life; whatever forms there are in this life, and whatever forms there are in the next life; whatever perception of form there is in this life, and whatever perception of form there is in the next life; whatever perception of the imperturbable there is—all these are perceptions. Where they cease without remainder, that is peaceful, that is sublime—namely, the |base of nothingness::field of awareness centered on the absence of any distinct “something" to grasp or hold onto [ākiñcaññāyatana]|.’ When he practices in this way and dwells thus often, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the base of nothingness now or resolves upon it with wisdom. With the breakup of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness may pass on [to rebirth] in the base of nothingness. This, bhikkhus, is said to be the first way of practice conducive to the base of nothingness.

Again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut reflects thus: ‘This is empty of a self or of what belongs to a self.’ When he practices in this way and dwells thus often, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the base of nothingness now or resolves upon it with wisdom. With the breakup of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness may pass on [to rebirth] in the base of nothingness. This, bhikkhus, is said to be the second way of practice conducive to the base of nothingness.

Again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones reflects thus: ‘I do not belong to anyone anywhere, nor does anything belong to me anywhere.’ When he practices in this way and dwells thus often, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the base of nothingness now or resolves upon it with wisdom. With the breakup of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness may pass on [to rebirth] in the base of nothingness. This, bhikkhus, is said to be the third way of practice conducive to the base of nothingness.

### Neither Perception nor Non-Perception

Again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones reflects thus: ‘Whatever sensual pleasures there are concerning this life, and whatever sensual pleasures there are in the next life; whatever perception of sensuality there is in this life, and whatever perception of sensuality there is in the next life; whatever forms there are in this life, and whatever forms there are in the next life; whatever perception of form there is in this life, and whatever perception of form there is in the next life; whatever perception of the imperturbable there is, and whatever perception of the base of nothingness there is—all these are perceptions. Where they cease without remainder, that is peaceful, that is sublime—namely, the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|.’ When he practices in this way and dwells thus often, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the base of neither perception nor non-perception now or resolves upon it with wisdom. With the breakup of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness may pass on [to rebirth] in the base of neither perception nor non-perception. This, bhikkhus, is said to be the practice conducive to the base of neither perception nor non-perception.

### Nibbāna

When this was said, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, a bhikkhu practices in this way: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. What there is, what has come to be—that I abandon.’ Thus he acquires equanimity. Would that bhikkhu attain |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|, venerable sir, or would he not?”

“Here, Ānanda, one bhikkhu might attain Nibbāna, while another bhikkhu might not attain Nibbāna.”

“What is the cause, venerable sir, what is the condition why one bhikkhu might attain Nibbāna, while another bhikkhu might not attain Nibbāna?”

“Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu practices in this way: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. What there is, what has come to be—that I abandon.’ Thus he acquires |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkha]|. He delights in that equanimity, welcomes it, and remains |holding tightly::clinging, fixating [ajjhosāya]| to it. As he delights in that equanimity, welcomes it, and remains holding tightly to it, his consciousness becomes dependent on it and clings to it. A bhikkhu with clinging, Ānanda, does not attain Nibbāna.”

“But, venerable sir, when that bhikkhu clings, what does he cling to?”

“To the base of neither perception nor non-perception, Ānanda.”

“When that bhikkhu clings, venerable sir, it seems he clings to the best [object of] clinging.”

“When that bhikkhu clings, Ānanda, he clings to the best [object of] clinging. For this is the best [object of] clinging, Ānanda, namely, the base of neither perception nor non-perception.”

Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu practices in this way: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. What there is, what has come to be—that I abandon.’ Thus he acquires equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, does not welcome it, and does not remain holding tightly to it. As he does not delight in that equanimity, does not welcome it, and does not remain holding tightly to it, his consciousness does not become dependent on it and does not cling to it. A bhikkhu without clinging, Ānanda, attains Nibbāna.”

“It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvelous! It seems, venerable sir, that the Blessed One has declared the crossing of the flood by relying [on one support after another]. But what, venerable sir, is the noble |deliverance::release, emancipation, freedom [vimokkha]|?”

“Here, Ānanda, a disciple of the Noble Ones reflects thus: ‘Whatever sensual pleasures there are concerning this life, and whatever sensual pleasures there are in the next life; whatever perception of sensuality there is in this life, and whatever perception of sensuality there is in the next life; whatever forms there are in this life, and whatever forms there are in the next life; whatever perception of form there is in this life, and whatever perception of form there is in the next life; whatever perception of the imperturbable, whatever perception of the base of nothingness, and whatever perception of the base of neither perception nor non-perception—this is identity as far as identity extends. This is the |deathless::deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amata]|, namely, the deliverance of the mind through |not clinging::not grasping, not holding (onto), detaching (from), not taking possession (of); lit. not taking near [anupāda]|.”

Thus, Ānanda, I have taught the practice conducive to the imperturbable, I have taught the practice conducive to the base of nothingness, I have taught the practice conducive to the base of neither perception nor non-perception, I have taught the crossing of the flood by relying [on one support after another], and I have taught the noble deliverance.

What a teacher should do out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, I have done for you, Ānanda. Here are these roots of trees, here are these empty huts. Meditate, Ānanda, do not be negligent; lest you later regret it. This is our instruction to you.”

The Blessed One said this. The venerable Ānanda was delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
