Thus have I heard — At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus."

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who has not abandoned the five barriers of the mind and not severed the five shackles of the mind should come to growth, increase, and fulfillment in this teaching and training - that is impossible.

What are the five barriers of the mind that have not been abandoned? Here a bhikkhu has doubt and uncertainty about the teacher, does not have confidence and does not settle his mind in faith. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. As his mind does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving, that is the first barrier of the mind that has not been abandoned.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has doubt and uncertainty about the Dhamma, does not have confidence, and does not settle his mind in faith. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. Because his mind does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving, this is the second barrier of the mind that has not been abandoned.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has doubt and uncertainty about the Saṅgha, does not have confidence, and does not settle his mind in faith. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. Because his mind does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving, this is the third barrier of the mind that has not been abandoned.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has doubt and uncertainty about the training, does not have confidence, and does not settle his mind in faith. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. Because his mind does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving, this is the fourth barrier of the mind that has not been abandoned.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is angry and displeased with his fellow practitioners, has an unsettled mind, and has developed a barrier in his mind. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. Because his mind does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving, this is the fifth barrier of the mind that has not been abandoned. These are the five barriers of the mind that have not been abandoned.

And what are the five shackles of the mind that have not been severed? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not free from passion, desire, affection, longing, yearning, and craving for sensual pleasures. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. Because his mind does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving, this is the first shackle of the mind that has not been severed.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not free from passion, desire, affection, longing, yearning, and craving for the body.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not free from passion, desire, affection, longing, yearning, and craving for forms. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having eaten as much as he likes until his belly is full, lives devoted to the pleasure of lying down, reclining, and sleeping. The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. Because his mind does not incline towards exertion, examination, perseverance, and striving, this is the fourth shackle of the mind that has not been severed.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu engages in the spiritual life aspiring to some order of gods thus, 'By this virtue, this spiritual practice, this austerity, or this spiritual life, I will become a god or one of the gods.' The mind of such a bhikkhu does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving. Because his mind does not incline towards exertion, investigation, perseverance, and striving, this is the fifth shackle of the mind that has not been severed. These are the five shackles of the mind that have not been severed.

Bhikkhus, when any bhikkhu has abandoned these five barriers of the mind and completely severed these five shackles of the mind, it is possible for him to come to growth, increase, and fulfillment in this teaching and training.

He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |energy::persistence| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination| and accompanied by intentional effort. And then, enthusiasm is the fifth factor.

A bhikkhu who is endowed with these fifteen factors including enthusiasm is capable of complete disenchantment, capable of awakening, and capable of attaining the unsurpassed security from |bondage::Nibbāna|. Just as, a hen has eight, ten, or twelve eggs, and she incubates them properly, and nurtures them properly. Even though she did not wish: 'Oh, if only my chicks would break through the eggshell safely with their claws or beaks,' yet those chicks are capable of breaking through the eggshell safely with their claws or beaks.

So too, a bhikkhu who is endowed with these fifteen factors including enthusiasm is capable of complete disenchantment, capable of awakening, and capable of attaining the unsurpassed security from |bondage::Nibbāna|."

When the Blessed One had said this, the bhikkhus were satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words.
