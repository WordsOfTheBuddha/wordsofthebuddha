Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Then the young brahmin Subha, son of Todeyya, approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One. After having engaged in courteous and polite conversation, he sat to one side. As he was seated to one side, the young brahmin Subha, son of Todeyya, said this to the Blessed One:

“What is the cause, sir Gotama, what is the condition, due to which, among human beings, there is seen such |disparity and inequality::fact of being inferior and superior; coarse and refined state [hīnappaṇītatā]|? For, sir Gotama, some human beings can be seen who are short-lived, and others who are long-lived; some can be seen who are frequently ill, and others who are seldom sick; some who are unattractive, and others who are graceful; some |of little influence::who are insignificant, unimportant [appesakkha]|, and others |of great influence::who are distinguished, renowned [mahesakkha]|; some of little wealth, and others |of great wealth::with many possessions, with great property [mahābhoga]|; some of low birth, and others of high birth; some who are |undiscerning::without wisdom [duppañña]|, and others who are |wise::discerning, percipient [paññavant]|. What, sir Gotama, is the cause, what is the condition, due to which, among human beings, there is seen such disparity and inequality?”

“All beings are owners of their actions, young man, |heirs to their actions::bearers of the consequences of their actions [kammadāyāda]|; |born from their actions::having deeds as one's womb [kammayoni]|, related to their actions, and have actions as their refuge. It is actions that distinguishes beings—that is, by way of their disparity and inequality.”

“I do not understand in detail, sir Gotama, the meaning of this statement, which was spoken in brief, without being analyzed in detail. It would be good, sir Gotama, if you would teach the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| in such a way that I might understand the detailed meaning of this statement which was spoken in brief, without being analyzed in detail.”

“Then, young man, listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” said the young brahmin Subha, son of Todeyya, to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Here, young man, a certain woman or man kills living beings; they are cruel, |bloody-handed::blood-thirsty, violent [lohitapāṇi]|, entrenched in violence and killing, and without mercy for living beings. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a |state of loss::state of misery [apāya]|, in a bad destination, in a |realm of downfall::realm of misery [vinipāta]|, in |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in the realm of downfall, in hell, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are short-lived. This, young man, is the way that leads to a short life: namely, killing living beings, being cruel, bloody-handed, entrenched in violence and killing, and being without mercy for living beings.

But here, young man, a certain woman or man, having abandoned the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings. They have laid down rod and weapon; they are |conscientious::sensitive, with an internal sense of carefulness and concern for the welfare of others [lajjī]| and |compassionate::sympathetic [dayāpanna]|, and dwell with |sympathy::benevolence, protectiveness, gentle regard [anukampā]| for the welfare of all living beings. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are long-lived. This, young man, is the way that leads to a long life: namely, abstaining from killing living beings, having laid down rod and weapon, being conscientious and compassionate, and dwelling with sympathy for the welfare of all living beings.

Here, young man, a certain woman or man is accustomed to injuring beings, either with the hand, with a stone, with a stick, or with a weapon. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a realm of downfall, in hell. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in the realm of downfall, in hell, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are frequently ill. This, young man, is the way that leads to frequent illness: namely, injuring beings, either with the hand, with a stone, with a stick, or with a weapon.

But here, young man, a certain woman or man is accustomed to not injuring beings, either with the hand, with a stone, with a stick, or with a weapon. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are seldom sick. This, young man, is the way that leads to being seldom sick: namely, not injuring beings, either with the hand, with a stone, with a stick, or with a weapon.

Here, young man, a certain woman or man is |irritable::prone to anger [kodhana]| and |very afflicted::greatly troubled [upāyāsabahula]|. Even when spoken to only slightly, they lose their temper, become agitated, hostile, and |stubborn::obstinate, resistant [patiṭṭhīyati]|; they reveal their anger, |aversion::hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, and |indignation::bitterness, outrage [appaccaya]|. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a realm of downfall, in hell. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in the realm of downfall, in hell, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are |unattractive::bad looking, ugly [dubbaṇṇa]|. This, young man, is the way that leads to being unattractive: namely, being irritable and very afflicted; even when spoken to only slightly, losing temper, becoming agitated, hostile, and stubborn; and revealing anger, aversion, and indignation.

But here, young man, a certain woman or man is not irritable and unafflicted most of the time. Even when spoken to harshly, they do not lose their temper, do not become agitated, hostile, or stubborn; they do not reveal their anger, aversion, or indignation. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are |graceful::pleasing, elegant [pāsādika]|. This, young man, is the way that leads to being graceful: namely, not being irritable and not very afflicted; even when spoken to harshly, not losing temper, not becoming agitated, hostile, or stubborn; and not revealing anger, aversion, or indignation.

Here, young man, a certain woman or man is |envious::jealous [issāmanaka]|. They envy, resent, and begrudge the acquisitions, respect, honor, esteem, reverence and adoration received by another. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a realm of downfall, in hell. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in the realm of downfall, in hell, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are of little influence. This, young man, is the way that leads to being of little influence: namely, being envious; envying, resenting, and begrudging the acquisitions, respect, honor, esteem, reverence and adoration received by another.

But here, young man, a certain woman or man is not envious. They do not envy, resent, or begrudge the acquisitions, respect, honor, esteem, reverence and adoration received by another. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are of great influence. This, young man, is the way that leads to being of great influence: namely, not being envious; not envying, resenting, or begrudging the acquisitions, respect, honor, esteem, reverence and adoration received by another.

Here, young man, a certain woman or man is not a giver of food, drink, clothing, vehicle, garlands, fragrances, and ointments, bedding, lodging, and lighting to ascetics or brahmins. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a realm of downfall, in hell. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in the realm of downfall, in hell, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they have little wealth. This, young man, is the way that leads to being of little wealth: namely, not being a giver of food, drink, clothing, vehicle, garlands, fragrances, and ointments, bedding, lodging, and lighting to ascetics or brahmins.

But here, young man, a certain woman or man is a giver of food, drink, clothing, vehicle, garlands, fragrances, and ointments, bedding, lodging, and lighting to ascetics or brahmins. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they have great wealth. This, young man, is the way that leads to having great wealth: namely, being a giver of food, drink, clothing, vehicle, garlands, fragrances, and ointments, bedding, lodging, and lighting to ascetics or brahmins.

Here, young man, a certain woman or man is |stiff::firm, obstinate; (comm) stiff with anger and conceit [thaddha]| and |arrogant::proud, conceited [atimānī]|: they do not pay respects to one who should be paid respect; they do not stand up for one who deserves standing up for; they do not offer a seat to one who is worthy of a seat; they do not make way for one who should be given right of way; they do not honor one who should be honored; they do not esteem one who is worthy of esteem; they do not revere one who is worthy of reverence; they do not venerate one who is worthy of veneration. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a realm of downfall, in hell. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in the realm of downfall, in hell, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are of low birth. This, young man, is the way that leads to being of low birth: namely, being stiff and arrogant; not paying respects to one who should be paid respect; not standing up for one who deserves standing up for; not offering a seat to one who is worthy of a seat; not making way for one who should be given right of way; not honoring one who should be honored; not esteeming one who is worthy of esteem; not revering one who is worthy of reverence; and not venerating one who is worthy of veneration.

But here, young man, a certain woman or man is not stiff nor arrogant: they pay respects to one who should be paid respect; they stand up for one who deserves standing up for; they offer a seat for one who is worthy of a seat; they make way for one should be given right of way; they honor one who should be honored; they esteem one who is worthy of esteem; they revere one who is worthy of reverence; they venerate one who is worthy of veneration. Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are of high birth. This, young man, is the way that leads to being of high birth: namely, not being stiff and not being arrogant; paying respects to one who should be paid respect; standing up for one who deserves standing up for; offering a seat to one who is worthy of a seat; making way for one who should be given right of way; honoring one who should be honored; esteeming one who is worthy of esteem; revering one who is worthy of reverence; and venerating one who is worthy of veneration.

Here, young man, a certain woman or man does not approach an ascetic or brahmin and ask questions: ‘What, venerable sir, is |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]|? What is |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]|? What is |objectionable::at fault, blameworthy [sāvajja]|? What is |blameless::irreproachable, faultless [anavajja]|? What |should be practiced::should be associated with, should be undertaken [sevitabba]|? What should not be practiced? What kind of action will lead to my harm and suffering for a long time? What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time?’ Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a realm of downfall, in hell. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in the realm of downfall, in hell, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are |undiscerning::without wisdom [duppañña]|. This, young man, is the way that leads to being undiscerning: namely, not approaching an ascetic or brahmin and asking questions: ‘What, venerable sir, is wholesome? What is unwholesome? What is objectionable? What is blameless? What should be practiced? What should not be practiced? What kind of action will lead to my harm and suffering for a long time? What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time?’

But here, young man, a certain woman or man does approach an ascetic or brahmin and ask questions: ‘What, venerable sir, is wholesome? What is unwholesome? What is objectionable? What is blameless? What should be practiced? What should not be practiced? What kind of action will lead to my harm and suffering for a long time? What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time?’ Through that action, thus adopted and undertaken, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. If, however, upon the breaking up of the body after death, they are not reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, but instead they return to the human state, then wherever they are reborn, they are |of great wisdom::very wise, extremely intelligent [mahāpañña]|. This, young man, is the way that leads to being of great wisdom: namely, approaching an ascetic or brahmin and asking questions: ‘What, venerable sir, is wholesome? What is unwholesome? What is objectionable? What is blameless? What should be practiced? What should not be practiced? What kind of action will lead to my harm and suffering for a long time? What kind of action will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time?’

Thus, young man, the way that leads to short life brings about a short life, the way that leads to a long life brings about a long life; the way that leads to being frequently ill brings about frequent illness, the way that leads to being seldom sick brings about good health; the way that leads to being unattractive brings about unattractiveness, the way that leads to being graceful brings about gracefulness; the way that leads to being of little influence brings about little influence, the way that leads to being of great influence brings about great influence; the way that leads to little wealth brings about little wealth, the way that leads to great wealth brings about great wealth; the way that leads to a low birth brings about low birth, the way that leads to a high birth brings about high birth; the way that leads to being undiscerning brings about being undiscerning, the way that leads to great wisdom brings about being of great wisdom.

All beings are owners of their actions, young man, |heirs to their actions::bearers of the consequences of their actions [kammadāyāda]|; |born from their actions::having deeds as one's womb [kammayoni]|, related to their actions, and have actions as their refuge. It is actions that distinguishes beings—that is, by way of their disparity and inequality.”

When this was said, the young brahmin Subha, son of Todeyya, said this to the Blessed One: “Excellent, sir Gotama! Excellent, sir Gotama! Just as if one might set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way, friend Gotama, the Dhamma has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by you in many ways. I go for refuge to the venerable Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. May the venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life.”
