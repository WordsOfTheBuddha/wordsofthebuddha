title: Mūlapariyāya sutta - Root Of All Things
description: The Buddha explains how the notion of a personal existence emerges from the process of perception. A wide range of phenomena are considered, embracing naturalistic, cosmological and sense experiences. An uninstructed ordinary person interprets experience in terms of a self, while those who have understood the Dhamma have the same experiences without attachment.
