title: Sallekha sutta - Effacement
description: The Buddha distinguishes pleasant abidings in the here and now from the way of effacement leading upwards to complete quenching. Effacement is shown as the gradual chipping away of defilements through restraint, cultivation of the noble eightfold path, and diligent training, culminating in the complete freedom of Nibbāna.

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mahā Cunda emerged from seclusion and approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated thus, the venerable Mahā Cunda said to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, these various kinds of views that arise in the world—connected with |beliefs::doctrines, theories [vāde]| about the self or connected with beliefs about the world—|does the abandoning and relinquishing of these views come about in a bhikkhu who is attending only to the beginning [of his training]::Per the commentary on the middle length discourses, this question refers to one who has only reached the initial stages of insight meditation without attaining stream-entry. The type of abandonment under discussion is abandoning by wearing away, which is accomplished only by the path of the stream-entry. Venerable Mahā Cunda posed this question because some meditators were overestimating their achievement, thinking they had abandoned such views while they had not really eradicated them.|?”

“Cunda, as to these various kinds of views that arise in the world—connected with beliefs about the self or connected with beliefs about the world—wherever these views arise, whatever [object] these views underlie, and wherever these views manifest, if that is seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ then the abandoning and relinquishing of these views come about.

### The Eight Attainments

It is possible, Cunda, that here a certain bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born from seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and is |filled with joyful pleasure::imbued with joy and happiness, with delight and ease, sometimes experienced as an intense joy or pleasure, rapture [pītisukha]|. It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing |self-effacement::spiritual austerity, chipping away at the defilements, asceticism [sallekha]|.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]| of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

It is possible here that with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which is characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, is without reflection and examination, |born from collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and is filled with joyful pleasure. It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing self-effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

It is possible here that with the fading away of joyful pleasure, the bhikkhu dwells in a |state of equanimity::mental poised, mentally balanced, equanimous, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |ease::comfort, contentedness, happiness, pleasure [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing self-effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

It is possible here that with the abandoning of ease and |discontentment::discomfort, unpleasantness, something unsatisfactory, stress [dukkha]|, and with the settling down of |joy and sorrow::craving and aversion, pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, gladness and dejection, positive state of mind and negative state of mind [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing self-effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

It is possible here that with the complete surpassing of |perceptions of form::recognition of matter, concept of materiality [rūpasaññā]|, with the disappearance of |perceptions of sensory impact::recognition of sense impression [paṭighasaññā]|, and non-attention to |perceptions of diversity::recognition of diversity, perception of multiplicity [nānattasaññā]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of boundless space::field of boundless expanse, sometimes translated as dimension of infinite space [ākāsānañcāyatana]|, aware that ‘space is boundless.’ It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing self-effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

It is possible here that with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless space, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of boundless consciousness::field of limitless awareness [viññāṇañcāyatana]|, aware that ‘consciousness is boundless.’ It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing self-effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

It is possible here that with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless consciousness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of nothingness::field of awareness centered on the absence of any distinct “something" to grasp or hold onto [ākiñcaññāyatana]|, aware that ‘there is nothing.’ It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing self-effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

It is possible here that with the complete surpassing of the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|. It might occur to him: ‘I am practicing self-effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Vinaya of the Noble Ones.

Thus, Cunda, I have taught the way of effacement, the way of inclining the mind, the way of passing beyond, the way leading upwards, and the way leading to complete quenching. What a teacher should do out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, I have done for you, Cunda. Here are these roots of trees, here are these empty huts. Meditate, Cunda, do not be negligent; lest you later regret it. This is our instruction to you.”

The Blessed One said this. The venerable Mahā Cunda was satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.

Forty-four terms have been spoken,
five pathways have been taught;
The discourse called “Effacement”—
deep, vast as the ocean.
