commentary:
  - "[1] Per MA, light [obhāsa] is the preliminary radiance, which MT glosses as the light produced by the access to jhāna. MT adds that one who gains the fourth jhāna develops the light-kasiṇa as the preliminary to arousing the divine eye. The “vision of forms” (dassanaṁ rūpānaṁ) is the seeing of forms with the divine eye. Ven. Anuruddha was later declared by the Buddha to be the foremost disciple in the exercise of the divine eye."
  - "[2] Atinijjhāyitattaṁ rūpānaṁ. Per MA: “When perception of diversity arose, I thought I would attend to one type of form, whether agreeable or disagreeable. As I did so, excessive meditation upon forms arose in me.”"

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita's park.

Now at that time, the bhikkhus at Kosambi had taken to |blaming::accusing, conflicting [bhaṇḍanajāta]|, |quarreling::disputing [kalahajāta]|, and |disputing::arguing [vivādāpanna]| with one another, stabbing each other with pointed words.

Then, a certain bhikkhu approached where the Blessed One was; having approached and paid homage, he stood to one side. Standing to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, the bhikkhus at Kosambi have taken to blaming, quarreling, and disputing with one another, stabbing each other with pointed words. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would go to those bhikkhus out of |compassion::benevolence, concern, gentle regard [anukampā]|.” The Blessed One consented in silence.

Then the Blessed One went to those bhikkhus. Having approached, he said to the bhikkhus: “Enough, bhikkhus. Let there be no more blaming, quarreling, contending, or disputing.”

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Wait, venerable sir. Let the Blessed One, the Lord of the |Dhamma::the ultimate truth that the Buddha’s teachings point to [dhamma]|, be |untroubled::unconcerned, at ease [appossukka]| and devoted to a pleasant abiding here and now. We are the ones who will be responsible for the blaming, quarreling, contending, and disputing.”

Then, for a second time, the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus: “Enough, bhikkhus. Let there be no more blaming, quarreling, contending, or disputing.” And for a second time, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Wait, venerable sir. Let the Blessed One, the Lord of the Dhamma, be untroubled and devoted to a pleasant abiding here and now. We are the ones who will be responsible for the blaming, quarreling, contending, and disputing.” Then for a third time, the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus: “Enough, bhikkhus. Let there be no more blaming, quarreling, contending, or disputing.”

And for a third time, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Wait, venerable sir. Let the Blessed One, the Lord of the Dhamma, be untroubled and devoted to a pleasant abiding here and now. We are the ones who will be responsible for the blaming, quarreling, contending, and disputing.”

Then the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, taking his alms bowl and outer robe, entered Kosambi for alms. Having wandered through Kosambi for alms and after the meal, having returned from the alms round, he put his lodging in order. Then, taking his bowl and robe, and while still standing, he uttered these verses:

“When many voices shout at once,
none think themselves a |fool::immature person, child-like in understanding [bāla]|;
When the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| is breaking apart,
they deem no one greater than themselves.

|Completely muddle-minded::totally confused [parimuṭṭha]|, yet speaking as if wise,
speaking merely within the sphere of words;
They move their mouths however they please,
yet know not by what they are led.

He insulted me, he struck me,
he overpowered me, he robbed me;
Those who hold onto |resentment::grudge [upanayhati]|,
do not still their |hostility::hatred, ill will, animosity, enmity [vera]|.

He insulted me, he struck me,
he overpowered me, he robbed me;
Those who let go of resentment,
still their hatred.

Hostility is never |settled::calmed, appeased [sammati]| by hostility,
in this world at any time;
Only |without hatred::without animosity, with friendliness, with kindness, with goodwill [avera]| is hostility settled,
this is an eternal principle.

Others do not |comprehend::understand, recognize [vijānāti]|,
that we all must die;
But those who do comprehend this,
their |conflicts::arguments, disputes, differences [medhagā]| are settled.

Breakers of bones and murderers,
those who steal cattle, horses, and wealth;
Those who plunder countries—
even among them reconciliation occurs.
Why should it not be for you?

If one finds a |prudent::sensible and careful when making judgments and decisions, discerning [nipaka]| companion,
a virtuous and discerning fellow traveler;
Let one walk together, overcoming all dangers,
with a pleased mind and |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]|.

If one does not find a prudent companion,
a virtuous and discerning fellow traveler;
Then as a king leaves behind his conquered realm,
walk like a tusker in the woods alone.

A solitary life is better,
there is no companionship with |immature persons::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāle]|;
Let one walk alone, not partaking in |wrongdoing::a censurable deed (intention, speech, or act) to be avoided; includes subtle lapses as well as grave offenses, and is understood more fully through investigation and reflection [pāpakamma]|,
calm and unconcerned, like a tusker in the woods.”

Then, having spoken these verses while standing, the Blessed went to the village of |Bālakaloṇakāra::name of a village; lit. young salt makers village [bālakaloṇakāra]|. At that time, the venerable Bhagu was living in the village of Bālakaloṇakāra. When the venerable Bhagu saw the Blessed One coming from afar, he prepared a seat and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed his feet. The venerable Bhagu paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

When the venerable Bhagu was seated to one side, the Blessed One said to him: “I hope you are bearing up, bhikkhu, I hope you are managing. I hope you are not having any trouble obtaining alms food.”

“I am bearing up, Blessed One, I am managing. Venerable sir, I am not having any trouble obtaining alms food.”

Then the Blessed One, having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened the venerable Bhagu with a talk on the Dhamma, rose from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo park.

Now at that time, the venerable |Anuruddha::foremost disciple of the Buddha in divine eye; also a cousin of the Buddha [anuruddha]|, the venerable Nandiya, and the venerable Kimila were dwelling in the Eastern Bamboo park. The park keeper saw the Blessed One coming from afar, and on seeing him, said: “Do not enter this park, ascetic. Here, there are three young gentlemen intent on self-liberation. Do not disturb them.”

Venerable Anuruddha heard the park keeper speaking with the Blessed One. Hearing this, he said to the park keeper: “Friend park keeper, do not keep the Blessed One out. Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has come.”

Then the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila and said: “Come out, venerable sirs, come out! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has come.”

Then venerable Anuruddha, venerable Nandiya, and venerable Kimbila went out to welcome the Blessed One. One received his bowl and outer robe, another prepared a seat, and another set out water for washing his feet. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat, and having sat down, washed his feet. Then those venerables, having paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side.

When they were seated, venerable Anuruddha was addressed by the Blessed One: “I hope you are all keeping well, Anuruddhas, that you are all able to keep going, and that you are not having any trouble obtaining alms food.”

“We are all keeping well, Blessed One, we are all able to keep going, and we are not having any trouble obtaining alms food.”

“I hope you are all living |harmoniously::unified [samagga]|, Anuruddhas, on friendly terms, not disputing, blending like milk and water, and looking upon one another with kindly eyes.”

“Surely, venerable sir, we are living harmoniously, on friendly terms, not disputing, blending like milk and water, and looking upon one another with kindly eyes.”

“And how is it, Anuruddhas, that you are all living harmoniously, on friendly terms, not disputing, blending like milk and water, and looking upon one another with kindly eyes?”

“In this regard, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘It is a blessing for me, it is most fortunate for me, that I have such companions in the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]|.’ I maintain bodily acts of |loving-kindness::goodwill, friendliness, benevolence [metta]| toward those venerable ones both openly and in private; I maintain verbal acts of loving-kindness toward them both openly and in private; I maintain mental acts of loving-kindness toward them both openly and in private. I consider: ‘Why should I not set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do?’ Then I set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do. We are different in body, venerable sir, but one in mind.”

Venerable Nandiya and then venerable Kimbila also said to the Blessed One: “In this regard, venerable sir, I think thus: ‘It is a blessing for me, it is most fortunate for me, that I have such companions in the spiritual life.’ I maintain bodily acts of loving-kindness toward those venerable ones both openly and in private; I maintain verbal acts of loving-kindness toward them both openly and in private; I maintain mental acts of loving-kindness toward them both openly and in private. I consider: ‘Why should I not set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do?’ Then I set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do. We are different in body, venerable sir, but one in mind. It is in this way, venerable sir, that we are living harmoniously, on friendly terms, not disputing, blending like milk and water, and looking upon one another with kindly eyes.”

“Good, good, Anuruddhas. I hope that you all abide |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|, |resolute::determined, intent [pahitatta]|, and |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|.”

“Surely, venerable sir, we abide diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort.”

“And how is it, Anuruddhas, that you all abide diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort?”

“In this regard, venerable sir, whichever of us returns first from the village with alms food prepares the seats, sets out the water for drinking and for washing, and sets out the refuse bucket in its place. Whichever of us returns last eats any food left over, if he wishes; otherwise he throws it away where there is no greenery or drops it into water where there are no living beings. Then he puts away the seats, puts away the water for drinking and for washing, puts away the bowl for refuse, and sweeps the refectory. Whoever notices that the pots of water for drinking, washing, or the |latrine::excrement [vacca]| are low or empty, fills them. If they are too heavy for him, he calls someone else by a signal of the hand and they move it by joining hands, but because of this we do not break out into speech. And every five days, venerable sir, we sit together all night discussing the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|. It is in this way, venerable sir, that we abide diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort.”

“Good, good, Anuruddhas. But while you abide thus diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort, have you attained any superhuman state, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble person, a comfortable dwelling?”

“Venerable sir, while we abide thus diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort, we perceive |light::radiance [obhāsa]| and the vision of forms^[1]^. But that light, venerable sir, soon vanishes, and the vision of forms |disappears::vanishes; lit. places in-between [antaradhāyati]|; but we have not discovered the cause for this.”

“The cause for that should be discerned, Anuruddhas. Before my full awakening, while I was still a |Bodhisatta::Buddha before his awakening, aspirant Buddha [bodhisatta]|, I too perceived light and the vision of forms. But that light would soon vanish, and the vision of forms would disappear. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?’ Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness wrt suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering [vicikiccha]| has arisen in me, and due to doubt, my |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| has fallen away. When collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that doubt will not arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?’ Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Inattention::lack of attention [amanasikāra]| has arisen in me, and due to inattention, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that inattention will not arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling<collapse>—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I again perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?’</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Dullness and drowsiness::lack of mental clarity or alertness, mental sluggishness, lethargy, sleepiness lit. stiffness (of mind/body due to tiredness) [thinamiddha]| has arisen in me, and due to dullness and drowsiness, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that dullness and drowsiness will not arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling<collapse>—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I again perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Fear::trepidation; lit. stiffened state [chambhitatta]| has arisen in me, and due to fear, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. Suppose, Anuruddhas, a person were traveling along the main road, and killers sprang out on both sides of him; then fear would arise in him because of that. So too, fear arose in me, and due to fear, my collectedness fell away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear will arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling<collapse>—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I again perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Elation::excitement, exhilaration, perturbation [uppila]| has arisen in me, and due to elation, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. Suppose, Anuruddhas, a man seeking one entrance to a hidden treasure came all at once upon five entrances to a hidden treasure; then elation would arise in him because of that. So too, elation arose in me, and due to elation, my collectedness fell away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear, nor elation will arise in me again.’

Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Heaviness::discomfort, inertia; a coarse, unrefined mental state — agitation or emotional heaviness that obstructs subtle concentration. [duṭṭhulla]| has arisen in me, and due to heaviness, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear, nor elation, nor heaviness will arise in me again.’

Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Excessive energy::Overly aroused energy, when effort is applied too forcefully [accāraddhavīriya]| has arisen in me, and due to excessive energy, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. Suppose, Anuruddhas, a man were to seize a quail tightly with both hands, and because of that, it would die right there. So too, Anuruddhas, excessive energy arose in me, and due to excessive energy, my collectedness fell away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear, nor elation, nor heaviness, nor excessive energy will arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling<collapse>—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I again perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Sluggish energy::weak application of effort [atilīnavīriya]| has arisen in me, and due to sluggish energy, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. Suppose, Anuruddhas, a man were to hold a quail loosely in his hand, and because of that, it would fly away. So too, Anuruddhas, sluggish energy arose in me, and due to sluggish energy, my collectedness fell away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear, nor elation, nor heaviness, nor excessive energy, nor sluggish energy will arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling<collapse>—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I again perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Longing::aspiration [abhijappā]| has arisen in me, and due to longing, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear, nor elation, nor heaviness, nor excessive energy, nor sluggish energy, nor longing will arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling<collapse>—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I again perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears?</collapse> Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Perception of diversity::recognition of diversity, perception of multiplicity [nānattasaññā]| has arisen in me, and due to perception of diversity, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear, nor elation, nor heaviness, nor excessive energy, nor sluggish energy, nor longing, nor perception of diversity will arise in me again.’

As, Anuruddhas, I was thus dwelling—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I again perceived both light and a vision of forms. But soon afterward, the light vanished and the vision of forms disappeared. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which this light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears? Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘|Over contemplation::over analysis [atinijjhāyitatta]| upon forms^[2]^ arose in me, and due to over contemplation upon forms, my collectedness has fallen away. And when collectedness falls away, the light vanishes and the vision of forms disappears. I shall so act that neither doubt, nor inattention, nor dullness and drowsiness, nor fear, nor elation, nor heaviness, nor excessive energy, nor sluggish energy, nor longing, nor perception of diversity, nor over contemplation upon forms will arise in me again.’

Then, Anuruddhas, knowing: ‘Doubt is an |impurity::blemish, flaw, imperfection [upakkilesa]| of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of doubt. Knowing: ‘Inattention is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of inattention. Knowing: ‘Dullness and drowsiness are impurities of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of dullness and drowsiness. Knowing: ‘Fear is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of fear. Knowing: ‘Elation is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of elation. Knowing: ‘Heaviness is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of heaviness. Knowing: ‘Excessive energy is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of excessive energy. Knowing: ‘Sluggish energy is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of sluggish energy. Knowing: ‘Longing is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of longing. Knowing: ‘Perception of diversity is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of perception of diversity. Knowing: ‘Over contemplation upon forms is an impurity of the mind,’ I abandoned the mental impurity of over contemplation upon forms.

Then, Anuruddhas, while I was dwelling—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I perceived light, but did not see forms; or I saw forms, but did not perceive light, even for a whole night, or a whole day, or a whole day and night. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which I perceive light but do not see forms; or I see forms but do not perceive light, even for a whole night, or a whole day, or a whole day and night?’ Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘On the occasion when I do not attend to the sign of forms but attend to the sign of light, then I perceive light but do not see forms. On the occasion when I do not attend to the sign of light but attend to the sign of forms, I then see forms but do not perceive light, even for a whole night, or a whole day, or a whole day and night.’

Then, Anuruddhas, while I was dwelling—diligent, resolute, and with continuous effort—I perceived limited light and saw limited forms; I perceived |limitless::immeasurable, boundless [appamāṇa]| light and saw limitless forms, even for a whole night, or a whole day, or a whole day and night. Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘What is the cause, what is the condition, due to which I perceive limited light and see limited forms; I perceive limitless light and see limitless forms, even for a whole night, or a whole day, or a whole day and night?’ Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘On the occasion when my collectedness is limited, my |vision::faculty of seeing [cakkhu]| is limited. And with limited vision, I perceive limited light and see limited forms. On the occasion when my collectedness is limitless, my vision is limitless. And with limitless vision, I perceive limitless light and see limitless forms, even for a whole night, or a whole day, or a whole day and night.’

When, Anuruddhas, I had understood: ‘Doubt is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of doubt was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Inattention is an impurity of the mind,’ thus the mental impurity of inattention was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Dullness and drowsiness are impurities of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of dullness and drowsiness was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Fear is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of fear was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Elation is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of elation was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Heaviness is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of heaviness was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Excessive energy is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of excessive energy was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Sluggish energy is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of sluggish energy was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Longing is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of longing was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Perception of diversity is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of perception of diversity was abandoned. When I had understood: ‘Over contemplation upon forms is an impurity of the mind,’ thus, the mental impurity of over contemplation upon forms was abandoned.

Then it occurred to me, Anuruddhas: ‘Whatever were the impurities of the mind, those have been abandoned in me. Now let me develop collectedness in three ways.’ 1.) So, Anuruddhas, I cultivated collectedness |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|; I cultivated collectedness |free from reflection::free of thought, a second jhāna or above [avitakka]| and |with a measure of examination::with a modicum of exploration [vicāramatta]|; I cultivated collectedness free from reflection and free from examination. 2.) I cultivated collectedness with |uplifting joy::mental exhilaration; it ranges from a gentle delight to overwhelming rapture [pīti]|; I cultivated collectedness free from uplifting joy. 3.) I cultivated collectedness |accompanied by happiness::filled with agreeableness, ease, pleasantness [sātasahagata]|; I cultivated collectedness accompanied by |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|.

When, Anuruddhas, collectedness accompanied by reflection and examination was cultivated in me; collectedness free from reflection but with a measure of examination was cultivated in me; collectedness free from reflection and free from examination was cultivated in me; when collectedness with uplifting joy was cultivated in me; when collectedness free from uplifting joy was cultivated in me; when collectedness accompanied by happiness was cultivated in me; when collectedness accompanied by equanimity was cultivated in me—then, knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘|Unshakeable::unassailable, indisputable [akuppa]| is the |liberation of my mind::emancipated by mind/heart, samādhi obtained from fruition [cetovimutti]|. This is my final birth, now there is no more |renewed existence::renewal of being, reappearance, rebirth, future life [punabbhava]|.’

The Blessed One said this. The venerable Anuruddha was satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
