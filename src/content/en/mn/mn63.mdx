title: Cūḷamālukya sutta - The Shorter Discourse to Mālukyaputta
description: Dissatisfied with unanswered questions, the venerable Mālukyaputta demands explanations about the world, life force, and what happens to a realized one after death. The Buddha replies with a simile of a man struck by a poisoned arrow who refuses treatment until every trivial detail about the arrow and the archer is explained. Such delay would inevitably lead to death. Likewise, speculative views do not bring freedom from suffering.

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthī at Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

Then, while the venerable Mālukyaputta was alone in |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, the following |reflection::contemplation, train of thought [parivitakka]| arose in his mind:

“These |viewpoints::theories, beliefs; lit. gone into views [diṭṭhigatā]| have been left |unexplained::not stated, undeclared [abyākata]| by the Blessed One, set aside and not allowed by him, namely: ‘The world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ ‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the |life force::life, soul [jīva]| and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’ These, the Blessed One does not |explain::define, describe; lit. make distinct [byākaroti]|. And what the Blessed One does not explain is displeasing to me, it does not sit well with me. Therefore I will approach the Blessed One and |ask::enquire, question [pucchati]| him about this matter. If the Blessed One explains whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’—then, I will lead the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| under the Blessed One. But if the Blessed One does not explain whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’—then, I will give up the training and |revert back to lay life::return to the secular world; lit. goes back to the low [hīnāyāvattati]|.

Then, in the late afternoon, having emerged from |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, the venerable Mālukyaputta approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the venerable Mālukyaputta said to the Blessed One:

“Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in seclusion, this reflection arose in my mind: These viewpoints have been left unexplained by the Blessed One, set aside and not allowed by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’—these, the Blessed One does not explain. And what the Blessed One does not explain is displeasing to me, it does not sit well with me. Therefore I will approach the Blessed One and ask him about this matter. If the Blessed One explains whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’—then, I will lead the spiritual life under the Blessed One. But if the Blessed One does not explain whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’—then, I will give up the training and revert back to lay life.

If the Blessed One knows ‘the world is eternal,’ then let the Blessed explain to me that the world is eternal. Or if the Blessed One knows ‘the world is not eternal,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that the world is not eternal. But if the Blessed One does not know whether the world is eternal or not eternal, then it would be straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’ Likewise, if the Blessed One knows ‘the world is finite,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that the world is finite. Or if the Blessed One knows ‘the world is infinite,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that the world is infinite. But if the Blessed One does not know whether the world is finite or infinite, then it would be straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’ If the Blessed One knows ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that the life force and the body are the same. Or if the Blessed One knows ‘the life force is one thing and the body another,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that the life force is one thing and the body another. But if the Blessed One does not know whether the life force and the body are the same or if the life force is one thing and the body another, then it would be straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’ And if the Blessed One knows ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that after death, a Tathāgata exists. Or if the Blessed One knows ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that after death, a Tathāgata does not exist. But if the Blessed One does not know whether after death, a Tathāgata exists or does not exist, then it would be straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’ Or if the Blessed One knows ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist. Or if the Blessed One knows ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ then let the Blessed One explain to me that after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist. But if the Blessed One does not know whether after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist, or neither exists nor does not exist, then it would be straightforward for one who does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’”

“Mālukyaputta, did I ever say this to you: Come, Mālukyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will explain to you whether:

‘The world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ ‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“And did you ever say to me: Venerable sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Blessed One, and the Blessed One will explain to me whether:

‘The world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ ‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Mālukyaputta, it is not the case that I have ever said to you: Come, Mālukyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will explain to you whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’ Nor is it the case that you have ever said to me: Venerable sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Blessed One, and the Blessed One will explain to me whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’ Since this is so, |misguided person::vain person [moghapurisa]|, on what basis are you rejecting [the training]?

Whoever, Mālukyaputta, were to say: ‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One explains whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ that would still remain unexplained by the Tathāgata, and in the meantime, that person would die.

Suppose, Mālukyaputta, a man were struck by an |arrow::(any sharp pointed object which causes pain) dart [salla]| thickly smeared with poison. And his friends or companions, his |relatives::kinsman [ñātī]| or |family members::blood relatives [sālohitā]| would bring a |surgeon::doctor, physician [bhisakka]| to treat him. But the man might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know whether the person who struck me was a noble, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know the name and clan of the person who struck me.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know whether the person who struck me was tall or short or of medium height.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who struck me was dark or brown or sallow-skinned.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know whether the person who struck me lives in such a village or town or city.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know whether the bow that wounded me was a long bow or a crossbow.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know whether the bow string with which I was shot was made of hemp, or bamboo fiber, or sinew, or deer hide, or woven bark.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know whether the arrow shaft that struck me came from wild bush or planted field.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know what kind of feathers the arrow shaft that wounded me was fitted with, whether those of a vulture or a heron or a hawk or a peacock or a stork.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know with what sinew the shaft was bound, whether that of an ox or a buffalo or a wild animal or a monkey.’ And he might say: ‘I will not have this arrow removed until I know the very arrowhead with which I was struck, whether it was spiked or razor-tipped or barbed or made of iron bar or made of calf’s tooth or a poison-tipped arrow.’ All this would still remain unknown to that man, Mālukyaputta, and in the meantime, that man would die.

In the same way, Mālukyaputta, if someone were to say: ‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One explains whether: ‘the world is eternal,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ <collapse>‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing and the body another;’ ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or </collapse> ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ that would still remain unexplained by the Tathāgata, and in the meantime, that person would die.

Mālukyaputta, if there is the view, ‘the world is eternal,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. If there is the view, ‘the world is not eternal,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view, ‘the world is eternal,’ or the view ‘the world is not eternal,’ there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. It is for the striking down of these that I teach the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| in the here and now. Mālukyaputta, if there is the view, ‘the world is finite,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. If there is the view, ‘the world is infinite,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view, ‘the world is finite,’ or the view, ‘the world is infinite,’ there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. It is for the striking down of these that I teach the Dhamma in the here and now. Mālukyaputta, if there is the view, ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. If there is the view, ‘the life force is one thing and the body another,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view, ‘the life force and the body are the same,’ or the view, ‘the life force is one thing and the body another,’ there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. It is for the striking down of these that I teach the Dhamma in the here and now. Mālukyaputta, if there is the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. If there is the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. It is for the striking down of these that I teach the Dhamma in the here and now. Mālukyaputta, if there is the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. If there is the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or the view, ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. It is for the striking down of these that I teach the Dhamma in the here and now.

Therefore, Mālukyaputta, remember what I have left unexplained as unexplained, and what I have explained as explained. And what, Mālukyaputta, have I left unexplained? ‘The world is eternal’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘The world is not eternal’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘The world is finite’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘The world is infinite’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘The life force and the body are the same’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘The life force is one thing and the body another’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘After death, a Tathāgata exists’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘After death, a Tathāgata does not exist’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘After death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’—this, I have left unexplained. ‘After death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’—this, I have left unexplained.

And why, Mālukyaputta, have I left this unexplained? Because, Mālukyaputta, it is not beneficial, it is not connected with the fundamentals of the spiritual life, it does not lead to |disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]|, to the |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|, to |gradual ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]|, to |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|, to |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, to |full awakening::perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]|, to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|. That is why, I have left it unexplained.

And what, Mālukyaputta, have I explained? ‘This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|’—this, Mālukyaputta, I have explained. ‘This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|’—this, Mālukyaputta, I have explained. ‘This is the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|’—this, Mālukyaputta, I have explained. ‘This is the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|’—this, Mālukyaputta, I have explained.

And why, Mālukyaputta, have I explained this? Because, Mālukyaputta, it is beneficial, it is connected with the fundamentals of the spiritual life, it leads to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowledge, to full awakening, to Nibbāna. That is why, I have explained it. Therefore, Mālukyaputta, remember what I have left unexplained as unexplained, and what I have explained as explained.”

The Blessed One said this. The venerable Mālukyaputta delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
