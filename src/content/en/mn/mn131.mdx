Thus have I heard — At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus."

"Venerable Sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the summary and analysis of 'One who has had a single auspicious night.' Listen to it and pay close attention, I will speak."

"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

### Verse

"Let not a person revive the past,
nor place hope upon the future;
For what is past is left behind,
and the future is yet unreached.

With insight, see the present state,
as it arises, clear and firm;
Unshaken, untroubled,
that wise one should develop this mind.

Today, the effort must be made,
who knows if death will come tomorrow?
For there is no bargaining with death,
the great army that spares none.

But one who dwells with continuous effort,
diligent, both day and night;
It is they, the Peaceful Sage has said,
who has had a single auspicious night.

### Past

And how, bhikkhus, does one revive the past? One thinks, 'I was of such form in the past,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I had such feeling in the past,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I had such perception in the past,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I had such volitional formations in the past,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I had such consciousness in the past,' and thus finds delight there. This is how one revives the past.

And how, bhikkhus, does one not revive the past? One thinks, 'I was of such form in the past,' and does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I had such feeling in the past,' and does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I had such perception in the past,' and does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I had such volitional formations in the past,' and does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I had such consciousness in the past,' and does not find delight there. This is how one does not revive the past.

### Future

And how, bhikkhus, does one place hope upon the future? One thinks, 'I may have such form in the future,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such feeling in the future,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such perception in the future,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such volitional formations in the future,' and thus finds delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such consciousness in the future,' and thus finds delight there. This is how one places hope upon the future.

And how, bhikkhus, does one not place hope upon the future? One thinks, 'I may have such form in the future,' but does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such feeling in the future,' but does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such perception in the future,' but does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such volitional formations in the future,' but does not find delight there. One thinks, 'I may have such consciousness in the future,' but does not find delight there. This is how one does not place hope upon the future.

### Presently Arisen Phenomena

And how, bhikkhus, is one shaken up by presently arisen phenomena (feelings, thoughts, emotions, memories, and perceptions)? Here, bhikkhus, an uninstructed ordinary person who has no regard for the noble ones, and is unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]) of the noble ones, who has no regard for the persons of integrity, and is unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma of the persons of integrity, perceives form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form; perceives felt experience as self, or self as possessing felt experience, or felt experience as in self, or self as in felt experience; perceives perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as in self, or self as in perception; perceives volitional formations as self, or self as possessing volitional formations, or volitional formations as in self, or self as in volitional formations; perceives consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. In this way, bhikkhus, one is shaken up by presently arisen phenomena.

And how, bhikkhus, does one remain unshaken by presently arisen phenomena? Here, bhikkhus, a learned disciple of the noble ones who has seen the noble ones, is skilled in the noble Dhamma, well-disciplined in the noble Dhamma, who has seen the true persons, is skilled in the true Dhamma, well-disciplined in the true Dhamma, does not perceive form as self, nor self as possessing form, nor form as in self, nor self as in form; does not perceive felt experience as self, nor self as possessing felt experience, nor felt experience as in self, nor self as in felt experience; does not perceive perception as self, nor self as possessing perception, nor perception as in self, nor self as in perception; does not perceive volitional formations as self, nor self as possessing volitional formations, nor volitional formations as in self, nor self as in volitional formations; does not perceive consciousness as self, nor self as possessing consciousness, nor consciousness as in self, nor self as in consciousness. In this way, bhikkhus, one remains unshaken by presently arisen phenomena."

"Let not a person revive the past,
nor place hope upon the future;
For what is past is left behind,
and the future is yet unreached.

With insight, see the present state,
as it arises, clear and firm;
Unshaken, untroubled,
that wise one should develop this mind.

Today, the effort must be made,
who knows if death will come tomorrow?
For there is no bargaining with death,
the great army that spares none.

But one who dwells with continuous effort,
diligent, both day and night;
It is they, the Peaceful Sage has said,
who has had a single auspicious night. [Repeated]

So it was with reference to this that it was saslug: 'Bhikkhus, I will teach you the summary and analysis of 'One who has had a single auspicious night.'"

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words.
