Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable Sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the summary and analysis of ‘One who has had a single auspicious night.’ Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

### Verse

“Let not a person revive the past,
|nor place hope upon::does not anticipate, does not personally wish for [nappaṭikaṅkhati]| the future;
For what is past is left behind,
and the future has not arrived.

Whatever phenomena are presently arisen,
in each case he |discerns with insight::sees distinctly [vipassati]|;
|That unassailable, steady [vision]::Per MA, this describes insight not overpowered by lust or defilements. Here it refers not to Nibbāna itself, but to a stage of insight practice—contemplation of the present moment without being shaken or misled into a view of self. [asaṁhīra asaṅkuppa]|—
the wise one should cultivate.

Effort should be made today,
for who knows if death will come tomorrow?
There is no negotiating with death,
the great army that spares none.

But one who dwells with |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|,
|energetic::without laziness [atandita]|, both day and night;
It is they, the Peaceful Sage has said,
who has had a single auspicious night.

### Past

And how, bhikkhus, does one revive the past? One thinks, ‘I was of such |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one’s body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]| in the past,’ and thus finds |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]| there. One thinks, ‘I had such |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in the past,’ and thus finds delight there. One thinks, ‘I had such |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks things by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]| in the past,’ and thus finds delight there. One thinks, ‘I had such |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, and choices expressed as mental, verbal, and bodily activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); processes that produce kamma [saṅkhāra]| in the past,’ and thus finds delight there. One thinks, ‘I had such |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]| in the past,’ and thus finds delight there. This, bhikkhus, is how one revives the past.

And how, bhikkhus, does one not revive the past? One thinks, ‘I was of such form in the past,’ and does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I had such felt experience in the past,’ and does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I had such perception in the past,’ and does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I had such intentional constructs in the past,’ and does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I had such consciousness in the past,’ and does not find delight there. This is how one does not revive the past.

### Future

And how, bhikkhus, does one place hope upon the future? One thinks, ‘I may have such form in the future,’ and thus finds delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such felt experience in the future,’ and thus finds delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such perception in the future,’ and thus finds delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such intentional constructs in the future,’ and thus finds delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such consciousness in the future,’ and thus finds delight there. This is how one places hope upon the future.

And how, bhikkhus, does one not place hope upon the future? One thinks, ‘I may have such form in the future,’ but does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such felt experience in the future,’ but does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such perception in the future,’ but does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such intentional constructs in the future,’ but does not find delight there. One thinks, ‘I may have such consciousness in the future,’ but does not find delight there. This is how one does not place hope upon the future.

### Presently Arisen Phenomena

And how, bhikkhus, |is one swept away by::is carried away by, is drawn along by [saṁhīrati]| presently arisen |phenomena::characteristics, thoughts, mental states, mental qualities [dhammā]|? Here, bhikkhus, an |uninstructed::uninitiated, untaught, untrained [assutavant]| ordinary person, |who has no regard for::lit. who has not seen [adassāvī]| the Noble Ones and is unskilled and untrained in the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| of the Noble Ones; who has no regard for the persons of integrity, and is unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma of the persons of integrity, perceives form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as being in self, or self as being in form; perceives felt experience as self, or self as possessing felt experience, or felt experience as being in self, or self as being in felt experience; perceives perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as being in self, or self as being in perception; perceives intentional constructs as self, or self as possessing intentional constructs, or intentional constructs as being in self, or self as being in intentional constructs; perceives consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as being in self, or self as being in consciousness. In this way, bhikkhus, one is swept away by presently arisen phenomena.

And how, bhikkhus, |is one not swept away by::is not carried away by, is not drawn along by [na + saṁhīrati]| presently arisen phenomena? Here, bhikkhus, a learned disciple of the Noble Ones, bhikkhus, who has regard for the Noble Ones and is skilled and trained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones; who has regard for the persons of integrity and is skilled and trained in the Dhamma of the persons of integrity, does not perceive form as self, nor self as possessing form, nor form as being in self, nor self as being in form; does not perceive felt experience as self, nor self as possessing felt experience, nor felt experience as being in self, nor self as being in felt experience; does not perceive perception as self, nor self as possessing perception, nor perception as being in self, nor self as being in perception; does not perceive intentional constructs as self, nor self as possessing intentional constructs, nor intentional constructs as being in self, nor self as being in intentional constructs; does not perceive consciousness as self, nor self as possessing consciousness, nor consciousness as being in self, nor self as being in consciousness. In this way, bhikkhus, one is not swept away by presently arisen phenomena.”

“Let not a person revive the past,
nor place hope upon the future;
For what is past is left behind,
and the future has not arrived.

Whatever phenomena are presently arisen,
in each case he discerns with insight;
That unassailable, steady [vision]—
the wise one should cultivate.

Effort should be made today,
for who knows if death will come tomorrow?
There is no negotiating with death,
the great army that spares none.

But one who dwells with continuous effort,
energetic, both day and night;
It is they, the Peaceful Sage has said,
who has had a single auspicious night. [Repeated]

So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘Bhikkhus, I will teach you the summary and analysis of ‘One who has had a single auspicious night.’”

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
