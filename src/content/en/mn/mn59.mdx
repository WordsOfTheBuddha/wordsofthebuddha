title: Bahuvedanīya sutta - The Many Kinds of Feeling

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

Then the |builder::architect, master carpenter; lit. master of the place [thapati]| Pañcakaṅga approached the venerable Udāyī. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the venerable Udāyī and sat down to one side. While seated to one side, the builder Pañcakaṅga said to the venerable Udāyī: “How many kinds of |feeling::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, the experience felt on contact; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, venerable sir, have been stated by the Blessed One?”

“Three kinds of feeling, builder, have been stated by the Blessed One: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and |neither-painful-nor-pleasant::neutral sensation, feeling which is neither unpleasant nor pleasant, neither comfortable nor uncomfortable sensation [adukkhamasukha]| feeling. These, builder, are the three kinds of feeling stated by the Blessed One.”

When this was said, the builder Pañcakaṅga said to the venerable Udāyī: “Not three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One, venerable Udāyī. Two kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One: pleasant feeling and painful feeling. As for that feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant, venerable sir, this has been spoken of by the Blessed One as a |peaceful::tranquil; lit. calmed [santa]| and |sublime::excellent, fine, superior [paṇīta]| kind of pleasure.”

A second time, the venerable Udāyī said to the builder Pañcakaṅga: “Householder, it is not two kinds of feeling that have been stated by the Blessed One, but three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These, builder, are the three kinds of feeling stated by the Blessed One.”

And for a second time, the builder Pañcakaṅga said to the venerable Udāyī: “Not three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One, venerable Udāyī. Two kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One: pleasant feeling and painful feeling. As for that feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant, venerable sir, this has been spoken of by the Blessed One as a peaceful and sublime kind of pleasure.”

A third time, the venerable Udāyī said to the builder Pañcakaṅga: “Builder, it is not two kinds of feeling that have been stated by the Blessed One, but three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These, builder, are the three kinds of feeling stated by the Blessed One.”

And for a third time, the builder Pañcakaṅga said to the venerable Udāyī: “Not three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One, venerable Udāyī. Two kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One: pleasant feeling and painful feeling. As for that feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant, venerable sir, this has been spoken of by the Blessed One as a peaceful and sublime kind of pleasure.”

Neither was the venerable Udāyī able to convince the builder Pañcakaṅga, nor was the builder Pañcakaṅga able to convince the venerable Udāyī.

The venerable Ānanda heard this conversation between the venerable Udāyī and the builder Pañcakaṅga. Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the venerable Ānanda recounted to the Blessed One the entire conversation that had taken place between the venerable Udāyī and the builder Pañcakaṅga. When this was said, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda:

“Ānanda, it was a true presentation that the builder Pañcakaṅga did not accept from Udāyī, and it was also a true presentation that Udāyī did not accept from the builder Pañcakaṅga. I have stated two kinds of feeling, Ānanda, in one method of presentation; I have stated three kinds of feeling in another method of presentation; I have stated five kinds of feeling in another method of presentation; I have stated six kinds of feeling in another method of presentation; I have stated eighteen kinds of feeling in another method of presentation; I have stated thirty six kinds of feeling in another method of presentation; and I have stated one hundred and eight kinds of feeling in another method of presentation. Thus, Ānanda, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| has been shown by me in different presentations.

When the Dhamma has been shown by me in such different presentations, it may be expected of those who will not acknowledge, approve, and agree with what is |well spoken::articulate, eloquent [subhāsita]| and correctly said by others that they will take to |blaming::accusing, conflicting [bhaṇḍanajāta]|, |quarreling::disputing [kalahajāta]|, and |disputing::arguing [vivādāpanna]|, stabbing each other with pointed words. Thus, Ānanda, the Dhamma has been shown by me in different presentations. When the Dhamma has been shown by me in such different presentations, it may be expected of those who will acknowledge, approve, and agree with what is well spoken and correctly said by others that they will live |harmoniously::unified [samagga]|, on friendly terms, and without disputing, not disputing, blending like milk and water, and looking upon one another with kindly eyes.

Ānanda, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What five? |Forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]| cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and |enticing::arousing, tantalizing [rajanīya]|; |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]| cognizable by the ear <collapse>that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing;</collapse> |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]| cognizable by the nose <collapse>that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing;</collapse> |tastes::flavors experienced through the tongue such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes like umami or astringency—any gustatory experience that can become an object of craving, indulgence, comfort, or sensory delight [rasā]| cognizable by the tongue <collapse>that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing;</collapse> |tangible objects::tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| cognizable by the body that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. These, Ānanda, are the five cords of sensual pleasure. Whatever |happiness::contentment, ease, pleasant abiding [sukha]| and |pleasure::a positive state of mind; agreeable feeling born of mental contact, mental happiness [somanassa]| arises dependent on the five cords of sensual pleasure—this is the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures.

Ānanda, if someone were to say, ‘Beings experience happiness and pleasure only up to this point,’ I would not agree with them. For what reason? Because, Ānanda, there exists a happiness |more excellent:: more brilliant [abhikkantatara]| and |more sublime:: more refined [paṇītatara]| than that happiness. And what, Ānanda, is that other kind of happiness more excellent and more sublime? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna<collapse>, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|.</collapse> This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

Here, Ānanda, with the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy<collapse>, the bhikkhu dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and clearly aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He</collapse> enters and dwells in the third jhāna<collapse>, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’</collapse> This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

Here, Ānanda, with the abandoning of [bodily] pleasure and |pain::discomfort, unpleasantness. In this context, this is referring to bodily pain or sharp sensations. [dukkha]|<collapse>, and with the prior settling down of |mental pleasure and displeasure::the duality of positive and negative states of mind; mental happiness and mental pain [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu</collapse> enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna<collapse>, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant.</collapse> This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

Ānanda, if someone were to say<collapse>, ‘Beings experience happiness and pleasure only up to this point,’ I would not agree with them. For what reason? Because, Ānanda, there exists a happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.</collapse> And what, Ānanda, is that other kind of happiness more excellent and more sublime? Here, Ānanda, with the complete surpassing of |perceptions of form::recognition of matter, concept of materiality [rūpasaññā]|, with the disappearance of |perception of sensory impact::recognition of sense impression, aversion; lit. striking against perception [paṭighasaññā]|, and non-attention to |perception of diversity::recognition of diversity, perception of multiplicity [nānattasaññā]|, aware that ‘space is boundless,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of boundless space::field of boundless expanse, sometimes translated as dimension of infinite space [ākāsānañcāyatana]|. This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

Ānanda, if someone were to say<collapse>, ‘Beings experience happiness and pleasure only up to this point,’ I would not agree with them. For what reason? Because, Ānanda, there exists a happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.</collapse> And what, Ānanda, is that other kind of happiness more excellent and more sublime? Here, Ānanda, with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless space, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of boundless consciousness::field of limitless awareness [viññāṇañcāyatana]|, aware that ‘consciousness is boundless.’ This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

Ānanda, if someone were to say<collapse>, ‘Beings experience happiness and pleasure only up to this point,’ I would not agree with them. For what reason? Because, Ānanda, there exists a happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.</collapse> And what, Ānanda, is that other kind of happiness more excellent and more sublime? Here, Ānanda, with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless consciousness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of nothingness::field of awareness centered on the absence of any distinct “something" to grasp or hold onto [ākiñcaññāyatana]|, aware that ‘there is nothing.’ This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

Ānanda, if someone were to say<collapse>, ‘Beings experience happiness and pleasure only up to this point,’ I would not agree with them. For what reason? Because, Ānanda, there exists a happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.</collapse> And what, Ānanda, is that other kind of happiness more excellent and more sublime? Here, Ānanda, with the complete surpassing of the base of nothingness, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|. This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

Ānanda, if someone were to say, ‘Beings experience happiness and pleasure only up to this point,’ I would not agree with them. For what reason? Because, Ānanda, there exists a happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness. And what, Ānanda, is that other kind of happiness more excellent and more sublime? Here, Ānanda, with the complete surpassing of the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the |cessation of perception and what is felt::ending of recognition and felt experience, cessation of conception and what is felt [saññāvedayitanirodha]|. This, Ānanda, is the happiness more excellent and more sublime than that happiness.

It is possible, Ānanda, that wanderers of other sects might speak thus: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks of the cessation of perception and what is felt and he describes it as happiness. What is this, and how is this?’

Wanderers of other sects who speak thus, Ānanda, should be told this: ‘Friends, the Blessed One does not describe this as happiness only with reference to pleasant feeling. Rather, friends, wherever and in whatever way happiness is found, the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| describes that as happiness.’”

The Blessed One said this. The venerable Ānanda was delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
