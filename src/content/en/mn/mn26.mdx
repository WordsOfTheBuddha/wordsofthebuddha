Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

Then, the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, took his alms bowl and outer robe and entered Sāvatthi for alms. At that time, several bhikkhus approached the Venerable Ānanda, and having approached, they said to him, “Friend Ānanda, it has been a long time since we have heard a discourse on the Dhamma in the Blessed One’s presence. It would be good, friend Ānanda, if we might hear a discourse on the Dhamma in the presence of the Blessed One.”

“Therefore, Venerable Ones, go to the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka. Perhaps there you may have the chance to hear a discourse on the Dhamma in the Blessed One’s presence.”

“Yes, friend,” the bhikkhus replied to the Venerable Ānanda.

Then, after walking for alms and having returned from alms round in Sāvatthi, the Blessed One, having had his meal, addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to the Eastern Park, to Migāramātā’s mansion, |for the day’s abiding::meditation place for the day [divāvihāra]|.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. Then, together with the Venerable Ānanda, the Blessed One went to the Eastern Park, to the Migāramātā’s mansion, for the day’s abiding. Then, when it was late afternoon, the Blessed One emerged from |seclusion::solitude [paṭisallāna]| and addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to the |Pubbakoṭṭhaka::name of a bathing place outside Sāvatthi, lit. east wall [pubbakoṭṭhaka]| to wash our bodies.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One, together with the venerable Ānanda, went to Pubbakoṭṭhaka to wash their bodies. After washing his body at the bathing place, the Blessed One emerged and, wearing only his lower robe, stood drying his body. Then the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “Venerable sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearby. Venerable sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is pleasing and delightful. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One went to the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka out of compassion.” The Blessed One consented in silence.

Then the Blessed One went to the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka. At that time, several bhikkhus were seated at the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka, engaged in a Dhamma discussion. The Blessed One stood at the outer entrance, waiting for their conversation to conclude. When he understood that their conversation had ended, he cleared his throat and knocked on the latch. The bhikkhus opened the door for the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One entered the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, what conversation were you just now sitting together engaged in? And what was the subject of your discussion that was interrupted?”

“Venerable sir, our discussion on the Dhamma that was interrupted was about the Blessed One themselves, and then the Blessed One arrived.”

“Good, bhikkhus. It is appropriate for you, sons of good families who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness with faith, that you should gather for a Dhamma discussion. When you gather together, bhikkhus, two things are proper: either a Dhamma discussion or noble silence.

Bhikkhus, there are two kinds of |quests::searching, seeking, inquiring, pursuit [pariyesanā]| - the noble quest and the ignoble quest.

### The Ignoble Quest

And what, bhikkhus is the ignoble quest? Here, bhikkhus, someone who is themselves subject to birth seeks what is also subject to birth; someone who is themselves subject to aging seeks what is also subject to aging; someone who is themselves subject to illness seeks what is also subject to illness; someone who is themselves subject to death seeks what is also subject to death; someone who is themselves subject to sorrow seeks what is also subject to sorrow; someone who is themselves subject to defilement seeks what is also subject to defilement.

And what, bhikkhus, do you call subject to birth? Children and spouses, bhikkhus, are subject to birth; male and female servants are subject to birth; goats and sheep are subject to birth; chickens and pigs are subject to birth; elephants, cows, horses, and mares are subject to birth; |gold and silver are subject to birth::Wealth and possessions arise through production and external conditions, making them dependent and inherently impermanent from their origin|. These |acquisitions::attachment, taking as mine, appropriation, sense of ownership, identification [upadhi]|, bhikkhus, are subject to birth. Caught up, |infatuated with::greedy for, fixated on [mucchita]|, and committed to these, someone who is themselves subject to birth seeks what is also subject to birth.

And what, bhikkhus, do you call subject to aging? Children and spouses, bhikkhus, are subject to aging; male and female servants are subject to aging; goats and sheep are subject to aging; chickens and pigs are subject to aging; elephants, cows, horses, and mares are subject to aging; |gold and silver are subject to aging::Over time, possessions wear out, depreciate, or become obsolete, showing that they require constant upkeep to retain value|. These acquisitions, bhikkhus, are subject to aging. Caught up, infatuated with, and committed to these, someone who is themselves subject to aging seeks what is also subject to aging.

And what, bhikkhus, do you call subject to illness? Children and spouses, bhikkhus, are subject to illness; male and female servants are subject to illness; goats and sheep are subject to illness; chickens and pigs are subject to illness; elephants, cows, horses, and mares are subject to illness; |gold and silver are subject to illness::Wealth is vulnerable to damage, devaluation, or decay, reflecting its susceptibility to various forms of deterioration|. These acquisitions, bhikkhus, are subject to illness. Caught up, infatuated with, and committed to these, someone who is themselves subject to illness seeks what is also subject to illness.

And what, bhikkhus, do you call subject to death? Children and spouses, bhikkhus, are subject to death; male and female servants are subject to death; goats and sheep are subject to death; chickens and pigs are subject to death; elephants, cows, horses, and mares are subject to death; |gold and silver are subject to death::Possessions can be lost, destroyed, or rendered worthless, showing that no material item is secure or lasting|. These acquisitions, bhikkhus, are subject to death. Caught up, infatuated with, and committed to these, someone who is themselves subject to death seeks what is also subject to death.

And what, bhikkhus, do you call subject to sorrow? Children and spouses, bhikkhus, are subject to sorrow; male and female servants are subject to sorrow; goats and sheep are subject to sorrow; chickens and pigs are subject to sorrow; elephants, cows, horses, and mares are subject to sorrow; |gold and silver are subject to sorrow::Attachment to wealth breeds anxiety and grief, as possessions cannot provide lasting satisfaction or security|. These acquisitions, bhikkhus, are subject to sorrow. Caught up, infatuated with, and committed to these, someone who is themselves subject to sorrow seeks what is also subject to sorrow.

And what, bhikkhus, do you call subject to defilement? Children and spouses, bhikkhus, are subject to defilement; male and female servants are subject to defilement; goats and sheep are subject to defilement; chickens and pigs are subject to defilement; elephants, cattle, horses, and mares are subject to defilement; |gold and silver are subject to defilement::Pursuit of wealth and possessions can incite greed, attachment, and ego, leading to moral compromise and obstructing mental clarity and contentment|. These acquisitions, bhikkhus, are subject to defilement. Caught up, infatuated with, and committed to these, someone who is themselves subject to defilement seeks what is also subject to defilement.

### The Noble Quest

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble quest? Here, bhikkhus, someone who is themselves subject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, seeks the |unborn::uncreated, unproduced [ajātam]| unsurpassed security from bondage, |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|; someone who is themselves subject to aging, having understood the danger in what is subject to aging, seeks the unaging unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; someone who is themselves subject to illness, having understood the danger in what is subject to illness, seeks the unailing unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; someone who is themselves subject to death, having understood the danger in what is subject to death, seeks the deathless unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; someone who is themselves subject to sorrow, having understood the danger in what is subject to sorrow, seeks the sorrowless unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; someone who is themselves subject to defilement, having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement, seeks the undefiled unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna.

Bhikkhus, I too, before my full awakening, while still a |Bodhisatta::Buddha before his awakening, aspirant Buddha [bodhisatta]|, being myself subject to birth, sought what was also subject to birth; being myself subject to aging, sought what was also subject to aging; being myself subject to illness, sought what was also subject to illness; being myself subject to death, sought what was also subject to death; being myself subject to sorrow, sought what was also subject to sorrow; being myself subject to defilement, sought what was also subject to defilement. Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘Why am I, being myself subject to birth, seeking what is also subject to birth? Why am I, being myself subject to aging, seeking what is also subject to aging? ... being myself subject to illness ... subject to death ... subject to sorrow ... being myself subject to defilement, seeking what is also subject to defilement? Suppose, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; being myself subject to aging ... subject to illness ... subject to death ... subject to sorrow ... being myself subject to defilement, having understood the danger in what is subject to defilement, I seek the undefiled unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna.’

Bhikkhus, then, at a later time, while I was still young, with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, and in the prime of life, although my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness.

#### Base Of Nothingness

Thus, having gone forth, in search of what is |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]|, seeking the unsurpassed state of sublime peace, I approached Āḷāra Kālāma. Having approached him, I said to Āḷāra Kālāma, ‘Friend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’

When this was said, bhikkhus, Āḷāra Kālāma said to me, ‘The venerable one may stay here. This teaching is such that a wise person can soon enter upon and abide in it, realizing for themselves through direct knowledge their own teacher’s doctrine.’

Bhikkhus, before long, I quickly learned that teaching. And in so doing, merely by repetition, recitation, and verbal expression, I claimed both knowledge and seniority, saying ‘I know, I see,’ along with others who claimed the same.

Then it occurred to me: ‘Āḷāra Kālāma does not proclaim that he abides in this teaching simply based on faith alone, but he claims to have directly realized it by himself. Surely, Āḷāra Kālāma abides knowing and seeing this teaching.’

So, bhikkhus, I went to Āḷāra Kālāma, and having approached him, I asked, ‘To what extent, friend Kālāma, do you proclaim that you have directly realized and abide in this teaching?' When this was said, bhikkhus, Āḷāra Kālāma made known the |attainment of the base of nothingness::experience of the dimension of nothingness, a meditative absorption where one transcends all perception of material form, focusing instead on the experience of ‘nothingness’ [ākiñcaññāyatana]|.

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘Āḷāra Kālāma has |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|, and I too have faith. Āḷāra Kālāma has |energy::willpower, determination [vīriya]|, and I too have energy. Āḷāra Kālāma has |mindfulness::awareness, presence [sati]|, and I too have mindfulness. Āḷāra Kālāma has |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|, and I too have collectedness. Āḷāra Kālāma has |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]|, and I too have wisdom. Suppose I strive to realize directly the state that Āḷāra Kālāma declares he enters upon and abides in by realizing for himself with direct knowledge.’ Then, bhikkhus, before long, I too, by my own directly knowing, entered and abided in that state.

Then, bhikkhus, I went to Āḷāra Kālāma, and having approached him, I asked, ‘Friend Kālāma, is it to this extent that you declare that you enter upon and abide in this state by realizing for yourself with direct knowledge?'

'Friend, this is indeed the extent to which I declare that I enter upon and abide in this state by realizing for myself with direct knowledge.’

'Friend, I too have entered upon and abided in this state by realizing for myself with direct knowledge to this extent.’

'Friend, it is our good fortune, truly our great fortune, that we have such a companion in the spiritual life as the venerable one. The state that I declare I have directly known and realized, you too abide in, having directly known and realized it. The state that you abide in, having directly known and realized it, I too declare I have directly known and realized. So, the teaching that I know, you also know; and the teaching that you know, I also know. Thus, as I am, so are you; and as you are, so am I. Come, friend, let us together lead this community.’

Thus, bhikkhus, Āḷāra Kālāma, being my teacher, placed me, his student, as an equal to himself and honored me with great reverence.

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘This teaching does not lead to |disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]|, to the |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|, to |gradual ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]|, to |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|, to |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, to |full awakening::perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]|, to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|, but only to reappearance in the base of nothingness.’ So, bhikkhus, without becoming attached to that state, I grew disenchanted with it and departed.

#### Base Of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception

Then, bhikkhus, still in search of what is wholesome and seeking the unsurpassed state of sublime peace, I approached Uddaka |Rāmaputta::Rāma’s son [rāmaputta]|. Having approached him, I said to Uddaka Rāmaputta, ‘Friend Rāmaputta, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’

When this was said, bhikkhus, Uddaka Rāmaputta said to me, ‘The venerable one may stay here. This teaching is such that a wise person can soon enter upon and abide in it, realizing for themselves through direct knowledge their own teacher’s doctrine.’

Bhikkhus, before long, I quickly learned that teaching. And in so doing, merely by repetition, recitation, and verbal expression, I claimed both knowledge and seniority, saying ‘I know, I see,’ along with others who claimed the same.

Then it occurred to me: ‘Rāma did not proclaim that he abided in this teaching simply based on faith alone, but he claimed that he had directly realized it by himself. Surely, Rāma abided knowing and seeing this teaching.’

So, bhikkhus, I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta, and having approached him, I asked, ‘Friend, to what extent did Rāma proclaim that he had directly realized and abided in this teaching?'

When this was said, bhikkhus, Uddaka Rāmaputta made known the |attainment of the base of neither perception nor non-perception::a meditative absorption where one’s awareness is so subtle that there is only a residue of formations, which is neither a clear perception or an absence of it [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|.

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘Rāma alone did not possess faith, I too have faith. Rāma alone did not possess energy, I too have energy. Rāma alone did not possess mindfulness, I too have mindfulness. Rāma alone did not possess collectedness, I too have collectedness. Rāma alone did not possess wisdom, I too have wisdom. Suppose I strive to realize directly the state that Rāma declared having entered upon and abiding in by realizing for himself with direct knowledge.’ Then, bhikkhus, before long, I too, by my own directly knowing, entered and abided in that state.

Then, bhikkhus, I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta, and having approached him, I asked, ‘Friend Rāmaputta, is this the extent to which Rāma declared that he entered upon and abided in this state by realizing for himself with direct knowledge?'

'Friend, this is indeed the extent to which Rāma declared that he entered upon and abided in this state by realizing for himself with direct knowledge.’

'Friend, I too have entered upon and abided in this state by realizing for myself with direct knowledge to this extent.’

'Friend, it is our good fortune, truly our great fortune, that we see such a companion in the spiritual life as the venerable one. The state that Rāma directly knew and realized, you too abide in, having directly known and realized it. So, the teaching that Rāma knew, you also know; and the teaching you know, Rāma also knew. Thus, as Rāma was, so are you; and as you are, so was Rāma. Come, friend, you should lead this community.’

Thus, bhikkhus, Uddaka Rāmaputta, though a fellow practitioner in the spiritual life, placed me in the position of teacher and honored me with great reverence.

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘This teaching does not lead to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to directly knowing, to full awakening, to Nibbāna, but only to reappearance in the base of neither perception nor non-perception.’ So, bhikkhus, without becoming attached to that state, I grew disenchanted with it and departed.

#### Full Awakening

Then, bhikkhus, still in search of what is wholesome and seeking the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna, I gradually walked through |Magadha::An ancient kingdom in northeastern India and the setting for much of the Buddha’s teachings after his full awakening [magadha]| until I arrived at |Uruvelā::A region near the Nerañjarā river where the Buddha engaged in intensive meditation before attaining full awakening [uruvelā]|, near |Senānigama::A nearby village at Uruvelā, where the Buddha often went for alms. Its proximity to Uruvelā offered a balance of seclusion for meditation and accessibility for sustenance [senānigama]|. There I saw a delightful stretch of land, a graceful forest grove, with a river flowing nearby, clear and with beautiful, accessible banks, surrounded by a village suitable for alms.

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘This land is delightful, the forest grove is graceful, and a river flows nearby, clear and with beautiful, accessible banks, surrounded by a village suitable for alms. This is surely suitable for a young man of a good family intent on striving.’ So, bhikkhus, I sat down there, thinking, ‘This is suitable for striving.’

Then, bhikkhus, being myself subject to birth, I saw the danger in what is subject to birth and sought the unborn, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna, I attained the unborn, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; being myself subject to aging, I saw the danger in what is subject to aging and sought the unaging, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna, I attained the unaging, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; being myself subject to illness, I saw the danger in what is subject to illness and sought the unailing, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna, I attained the unailing, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; being myself subject to death, I saw the danger in what is subject to death and sought the deathless, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna, I attained the deathless, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; being myself subject to sorrow, I saw the danger in what is subject to sorrow and sought the sorrowless, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna, I attained the sorrowless, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; being myself subject to defilement, I saw the danger in what is subject to defilement and sought the undefiled, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna, I attained the undefiled, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna.

|Insight::understanding, knowing [ñāṇa]| and |vision::realization [dassana]| arose in me: ‘My liberation is unshakeable, this is my final birth, now there is no more |renewed existence::renewal of being, reappearance, rebirth, future life [punabbhava]|.’

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘The |Dhamma::mental quality, state [dhamma]| I have attained is |profound::hard to fathom [gambhīra]|, hard to perceive, difficult to comprehend, |tranquil::peaceful, calm [santa]|, sublime, |beyond the realm of conjecture::outside the realm of thought, beyond logic [atakkāvacara]|, subtle, to be experienced by the wise.’ But this generation delights in attachment, is devoted to attachment, and is pleased with attachment. For a generation that delights in attachment, is devoted to attachment and is pleased with attachment, this state is difficult to see - that is, the |general law of conditionality::actuality of dependence [idappaccayatā]| and |dependent co-arising::the process of arising together from a cause, chain of causation, dependent origination [paṭiccasamuppāda]|. And this state too is difficult to see - that is, |the stilling of all intentional constructs::calming of all intentions, volitions, mental activities. This is sometimes rendered as stilling of all formations [sabbasaṅkhārasamatha]|, the |relinquishing of all acquisitions::letting go of all attachments, releasing of all ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘mine’ making [sabbūpadhipaṭinissagga]|, |wearing away of craving::depletion of craving, wanting, yearning, passion [taṇhākkhaya]|, fading of desire, ending, Nibbāna. If I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me, it would be wearying and troublesome for me.’

Then, bhikkhus, these verses, never heard before, spontaneously occurred to me:

'With difficulty I have attained this,
there is no need to now teach;
For those |overwhelmed by craving and aversion::afflicted with lust and hatred, occupied by passion and blame [rāgadosapareta]|,
this Dhamma is not easily understood —

Against the [worldly] flow, refined,
profound, hard to perceive, and subtle;
Those |delighting in passion::infatuated with lust [rāgaratta]| will not see,
veiled as they are by the |mountain of ignorance::heap of darkness [tamokhandha]|.’

Then, bhikkhus, as I reflected thus, my mind inclined towards being unconcerned, not towards teaching the Dhamma.

Then, bhikkhus, the Brahmā Sahampati, knowing my train of thought in his own mind, thought: ‘The world is lost, truly, the world is utterly lost if the mind of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One, inclines towards being unconcerned and not towards teaching the Dhamma.’

Then, bhikkhus, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, the Brahmā Sahampati vanished from the Brahmā world and appeared before me. He arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards me, said: ‘Venerable sir, may the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, may the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are suffering loss from not hearing the Dhamma. There will be those who understand the Dhamma.’

Brahmā Sahampati said this, bhikkhus. Having said this, he added further:

'In Magadha, there has appeared in times past,
an impure teaching, devised by the defiled;
Open the door to the |deathless::deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amata]|!
Let them hear the Dhamma that the Unblemished One has discovered.

Just as one who stands on a mountain peak,
can see below the people all around;
So, too, O wise one, bearer of the Dhamma,
ascend the palace of wisdom, all-seeing one;
Let the Sorrowless One survey the world,
engulfed in sorrow, overcome by birth and old age.

Arise, hero! Victor in battle,
leader of the caravan, debtless one;
Wander in the world, Blessed One, teach the Dhamma,
there will be those who will understand.’

Then, bhikkhus, knowing Brahmā's request and out of compassion for beings, I surveyed the world with the |Buddha’s eye::eye of complete understanding [buddhacakkhu]|. Surveying the world with the Buddha’s eye, I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to instruct and difficult to instruct, some who dwelt seeing the problems and the dangers of the next world, and others who dwelt without seeing the problems and the dangers of the next world. Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grown in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and some other lotuses that are born and grow in the water rest on the water’s surface, and some other lotuses that are born and grow in the water rise out the water and stand clear, unsoiled by the water; so too, bhikkhus, surveying the world with the Buddha’s eye, I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to instruct and difficult to instruct, some who dwelt seeing the problems and the dangers of the next world, and others who dwelt without seeing the problems and the dangers of the next world.

Then, bhikkhus, I replied to Brahmā Sahampati in verse:

'The doors to the deathless are open,
let those with ears now show their faith;
|Perceiving as troublesome::thinking it burdensome [vihiṃsasaññī]|, I did not speak, O Brahma!
the subtle and refined Dhamma to humankind.’

Then the Brahmā Sahampati thinking, ‘The Blessed One consented to my request that he teach the Dhamma,’ paid homage to me, circumambulated keeping me on the right, and then disappeared right there.

### Teaching The Dhamma

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?'

Then it occurred to me: ‘Āḷāra Kālāma is wise, learned, intelligent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I were to teach the Dhamma first to Āḷāra Kālāma. He would quickly understand this Dhamma.’

Then, bhikkhus, a deity approached me and said: ‘Venerable Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’

Wisdom and vision arose in me: ‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’ I thought, ‘Āḷāra Kālāma has incurred a great loss. If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood it quickly.’

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?'

Then it occurred to me: ‘Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise, learned, intelligent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I were to teach the Dhamma first to Uddaka Rāmaputta. He would quickly understand this Dhamma.’

Then, bhikkhus, a deity approached me and said: ‘Venerable Sir, Uddaka Rāmaputta passed away last night.’

Wisdom and vision arose in me: ‘Uddaka Rāmaputta passed away yesterday.’ I thought, ‘Uddaka Rāmaputta has incurred a great loss. If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood it quickly.’

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?'

Then it occurred to me: ‘The group of five bhikkhus who attended upon me when I was resolutely striving. Suppose I were to teach the Dhamma first to the group of the five bhikkhus.’

Then it occurred to me: ‘Where are the group of five bhikkhus living now?' Then, with the |divine eye::the faculty of clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the ordinary human range [dibbacakkhu]|, purified and surpassing that of humans, I saw the group of five bhikkhus living in |Varanasi::modern day Varanasi [bārāṇasī]|, in the Deer Park at |Isipatana::name of a forest near Varanasi [isipatana]|. Then, bhikkhus, after dwelling at Uruvelā as long as I wished, I set out on a journey to Varanasi.

Then, bhikkhus, Upaka the |Ājīvaka::member of a renunciant sect| saw me as I was walking along the road between |Gayā::name of a village| and the Bodhi Tree. Seeing me, he said: ‘Friend, your faculties are clear, your complexion is pure and bright. Who is your teacher, friend? For whom have you gone forth? Whose Dhamma do you follow?'

When this was said, bhikkhus, I addressed Upaka the Ājīvaka in verse:

'Victorious over everything, all I have known,
yet I remain |untainted::unstained, unsullied [anūpalitta]| by all things conquered and known;
Having abandoned all, liberated through the |complete ending of craving::gradual wearing away of craving, depletion of desire, extinction of longing [taṇhakkhaya]|,
thus directly knowing by myself—whom should I call as my teacher?'

I have no teacher,
and one like me does not exist;
In the world with its |deities::gods [devas]|,
there is none equal to me.

I am |the Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]| in the world,
I am the unsurpassed teacher;
I alone am the perfectly Awakened One,
I am cooled and quenched.

To set the wheel of Dhamma in motion,
I go to the city of |Kāsī::modern day Varanasi [kāsī]|;
In a world that has become blind,
I will beat the drum of the deathless.’

'As you claim, friend, you are the worthy |universal conqueror::infinite victor [anantajina]|,’ said Upaka.

'Conquerors like me,
are those who have reached the end of defilements;
Harmful qualities have been vanquished by me,
and so, Upaka, I am a conqueror.’

When this was said, bhikkhus, Upaka the Ājīvaka replied, ‘Perhaps so, friend,’ shook his head, took a side road, and departed.

Then, bhikkhus, wandering gradually, I arrived at Varanasi, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, where the group of five bhikkhus were staying. The group of five bhikkhus saw me approaching from a distance, and they spoke to one another: ‘Friends, here comes the ascetic Gotama, who has given up his striving and turned back to a life of ease. We should not pay respects to him, nor rise to greet him, nor receive his alms bowl and outer robe. However, a seat should be prepared, and if he wishes, he may sit.’ But, bhikkhus, as I approached, the group of five bhikkhus could not maintain their agreement. Some came forward to receive my alms bowl and outer robe, some prepared a seat, and some set out water for washing my feet. However, they addressed me by name and as ‘friend.’

On this being said, bhikkhus, I addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five: ‘Bhikkhus, do not address the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| by name and as ‘friend.’ The Tathāgata is an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened One. Listen carefully, bhikkhus, the deathless state is attained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma. If you practice as instructed, before long you will soon enter upon and abide in that unsurpassed goal of the spiritual life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.’

When this was said, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus of the group of five replied to me: ‘Friend Gotama, by the conduct, the practice, and the performance of austerities that you undertook, you did not achieve any superhuman state, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble person. So how will you now, living a life of excess, having abandoned striving and turning back to a life of comfort, attain any superhuman state, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble person?'

When this was said, bhikkhus, I addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five: ‘Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata is not living a life of excess, nor has he abandoned striving, nor has he turned back to a life of comfort. The Tathāgata is an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened One. Listen carefully, bhikkhus, the deathless state is attained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma. If you practice as instructed, before long you will soon enter upon and abide in that unsurpassed goal of the spiritual life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.’

For the second time, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me: ‘But, friend Gotama, by the conduct, the practice, and the performance of austerities that you undertook, you did not achieve any superhuman state, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble person. So how will you now, living a life of excess, having abandoned striving and turning back to a life of comfort, attain any superhuman state, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble person?'

For the second time, bhikkhus, I said to the bhikkhus of the group of five: ‘Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata is not living a life of excess, nor has he abandoned striving, nor has he turned back to a life of comfort. The Tathāgata is an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened One. Listen carefully, bhikkhus, the deathless state is attained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma. If you practice as instructed, before long you will soon enter upon and abide in that unsurpassed goal of the spiritual life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.’

For the third time, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me: ‘But, friend Gotama, by the conduct, the practice, and the performance of austerities that you undertook, you did not achieve any superhuman state, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble person. So how will you now, living a life of excess, having abandoned striving and turning back to a life of comfort, attain any superhuman state, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble person?'

When this was said, bhikkhus, I asked the bhikkhus of the group of five: ‘Bhikkhus, have you ever known me to speak like this before?'

'No, venerable sir.’

'Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata is an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened One. Listen carefully, bhikkhus, the deathless state is attained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma. If you practice as instructed, before long you will soon enter upon and abide in that unsurpassed goal of the spiritual life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.’

I was able to convince the bhikkhus of the group of five. At times, I instructed two bhikkhus while the other three went for alms, and the six of us sustained on what those three bhikkhus brought back from their alms round. At other times, I instructed three bhikkhus while the other two went for alms, and the six of us sustained on what those two bhikkhus brought back from their alms round.

Then, bhikkhus, as the group of five bhikkhus was being instructed and guided by me in this way, they, being subject to birth, came to see the danger in what is subject to birth, and sought the unborn, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; and they attained the unborn, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna. Being subject to aging, they saw the danger in what is subject to aging and sought the ageless, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; and they attained the ageless, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna. Being subject to illness ... subject to death ... subject to sorrow ... subject to defilement, they saw the danger in what is subject to defilement and sought the undefiled, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna; and they attained the undefiled, the unsurpassed security from bondage, Nibbāna. And then there arose in them the wisdom and vision: ‘Our liberation is unshakeable, this is our final birth, now there is no more renewed existence.’

### Sensual Pleasures

Bhikkhus, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What five? |Forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]| cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and |enticing::arousing, tantalizing [rajanīya]|; |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]| cognizable by the ear that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing; |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]| cognizable by the nose that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing; |tastes::flavors experienced through the tongue such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes like umami or astringency—any gustatory experience that can become an object of craving, indulgence, comfort, or sensory delight [rasā]| cognizable by the tongue that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing; |tangible objects::tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| cognizable by the body that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. These, bhikkhus, are the five cords of sensual pleasure.

Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins who are bound to, infatuated with, and |obsessed::consumed, blindly absorbed [ajjhopanna]| with these five cords ofsensual pleasure, who do not see the danger in them, and who lack wisdom for escape, it may be understood of them: ‘They have fallen into misfortune, fallen into calamity, the |Evil One::profoundly immoral and wicked, having evil quality, epithet of Māra [pāpimant]| may do with them as he likes.’

Suppose, bhikkhus, a forest deer was lying down on a pile of snares and was caught. It should be understood of him: ‘He has fallen into misfortune, fallen into calamity, the hunter may do with him as he likes.’

So too, bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins who are bound to, infatuated with, and obsessed with these five cords ofsensual pleasure, who do not see the danger in them, and who lack wisdom for escape, it may be understood of them: ‘They have fallen into misfortune, fallen into calamity, the Evil One may do with them as he likes.’

Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins who are not bound to, not infatuated with, and not obsessed with these five cords ofsensual pleasure, who see the danger in them, and who possess wisdom for escape, it may be understood of them: ‘They have not fallen into misfortune, not fallen into calamity, the Evil One may not do with them as he likes.’

Suppose, bhikkhus, a forest deer was lying down on a pile of snares but was not caught. It should be understood of him: ‘He has not fallen into misfortune, not fallen into calamity, the hunter may not do with him as he likes.’

So too, bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins who are not bound to, not infatuated with, and not obsessed with these five cords ofsensual pleasure, who see the danger in them, and who possess wisdom for escape, it may be understood of them: ‘They have not fallen into misfortune, not fallen into calamity, the Evil One may not do with them as he likes.’

Suppose, bhikkhus, a forest deer wandering in the wilderness moves freely, stands freely, sits freely, and lies down freely. What is the reason for this? It is because he is beyond the hunter’s range, bhikkhus.

So too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy, the bhikkhu dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of [bodily] pleasure and |pain::discomfort, unpleasantness. In this context, this is referring to bodily pain or sharp sensations. [dukkha]|, and with the prior settling down of |mental pleasure and displeasure::the duality of positive and negative states of mind; mental happiness and mental pain [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the complete surpassing of |perceptions of form::recognition of matter, concept of materiality [rūpasaññā]|, with the disappearance of |perception of sensory impact::recognition of sense impression, aversion; lit. striking against perception [paṭighasaññā]|, and non-attention to |perception of diversity::recognition of diversity, perception of multiplicity [nānattasaññā]|, aware that ‘space is boundless,’ the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of boundless space::field of boundless expanse, sometimes translated as dimension of infinite space [ākāsānañcāyatana]|. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless space, aware that ‘consciousness is boundless,’ the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of boundless consciousness::field of limitless awareness [viññāṇañcāyatana]|. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the complete surpassing of the base of boundless consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of nothingness::field of awareness centered on the absence of any distinct “something" to grasp or hold onto [ākiñcaññāyatana]|. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the complete surpassing of the base of nothingness, the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Further, bhikkhus, with the complete surpassing of the base of neither perception nor non-perception, the bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the |cessation of perception and what is felt::ending of recognition and felt experience, cessation of conception and what is felt [saññāvedayitanirodha]|. And seeing with wisdom, his |mental defilements::mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]| are completely exhausted. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him. He has crossed over |entanglement in::attachment to [visattikā]| the world. He moves freely, stands freely, sits freely, and lies down freely. And why is that? Because he is beyond the reach of the Evil One, bhikkhus.

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
