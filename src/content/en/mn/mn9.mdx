Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. There, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus."

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta said:

"'Right view, right view,' is said, friends. To what extent, friends, does a noble disciple possess right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma?"

"Even from far away, friend, we would come to learn the meaning of this statement from the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. It would be good if Venerable Sāriputta himself would clarify the meaning of this statement. After hearing it from Venerable Sāriputta, the bhikkhus will remember it."

"Then listen, friends, and pay close attention, I will speak," said he.

"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta said:

### The Unwholesome and the Wholesome

"When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome — to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.

Taking life, friends, is unwholesome; taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, covetousness, ill will, and wrong view — this, friends, is called unwholesome.

And what, friends, is the root of the unwholesome? |Passion::lust, desire, attachment| is an unwholesome root, |aversion::ill will, hatred, resentment| is an unwholesome root, |delusion::assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification| is an unwholesome root— this, friends, is called the root of the unwholesome.

And what, friends, is the wholesome? Abstaining from taking life is wholesome, abstaining from taking what is not given, abstaining from sexual misconduct, abstaining from lying, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from harsh speech, abstaining from idle chatter, non-covetousness, good-will, and right view — this, friends, is called wholesome.

And what, friends, is the root of the wholesome? Contentment is a wholesome root, good-will is a wholesome root, |wisdom::choosing to carefully examine and independently verify| is a wholesome root — this, friends, is called the root of the wholesome.

When, friends, a noble disciple thus understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to passion, dispels the underlying tendency to aversion, eradicates the underlying tendency to the view 'I am', by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge, in this very life makes an ending of |suffering::discontentment, stress| — to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma."

There are these four nutriments, friends, for the maintenance of beings that have come to be and for the support of those seeking to be. What are the four? Edible food, coarse or fine, is the first, contact is the second, mental volition is the third, and consciousness is the fourth. The origin of nutriment is craving, the ending of nutriment is the ending of craving, and the noble eightfold path is the way of practice leading to the ending of nutriment, namely — right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.
