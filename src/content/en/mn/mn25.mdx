Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

#### Four Herds of Deer

“Bhikkhus, a |deer-trapper::baiter, trapper [nevāpika]| does not lay down bait for a herd of deer intending thus: ‘May the herd of deer enjoy this bait that I have laid down, be long-lived, beautiful, and sustain themselves for a long time.’ A deer-trapper lays down bait for a herd of deer intending thus: ‘The herd of deer will eat the food I have laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they eat the food rushing in and infatuated with it, they will |become intoxicated::experience vanity, pride, conceit [mada]|. Being intoxicated, they will fall into |negligence::carelessness, heedlessness [pamāda]|. When they are negligent, I can do with them as I wish on account of this bait.’

Now, bhikkhus, the first herd of deer ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait. That is how, bhikkhus, the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper.

Now, bhikkhus, the second herd of deer |strategized::lit. thought together [samacintesi]| thus: ‘The first herd of deer ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait. That is how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. What if we altogether abstain from that bait food; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, let us enter the |forest region::wilderness area [araññāyatana]| and dwell there.’ Then they altogether abstained from that bait food; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, they entered the forest region and dwelt there. But in the last month of the hot season, when grass and water ran out, their bodies reached a state of extreme emaciation. As their bodies reached extreme emaciation, their strength and |energy::willpower, determination [vīriya]| diminished. When their strength and energy had diminished, they returned to that very bait laid down by the deer-trapper. There they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait. That is how, bhikkhus, even the second herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper.

Now, bhikkhus, the third herd of deer strategized thus: ‘The first herd of deer ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it<collapse>, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. The second herd of deer strategized thus: “The first herd of deer<collapse> ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. What if we altogether abstain from that bait food; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, let us enter the forest region and dwell there.” Then they altogether abstained from that bait food; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, they entered the forest region and dwelt there. But in the last month of the hot season, when grass and water ran out, their bodies reached a state of extreme emaciation. As their bodies reached extreme emaciation, their strength and energy diminished. When their strength and energy had diminished, they returned to that very bait laid down by the deer-trapper. There they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait. That is how even the second herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. What if we make a lair close to that bait laid down by the deer-trapper. Having made a lair there, let us eat the bait laid down by the deer-trapper not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As we eat the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, we will not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, we will not fall into negligence. When we are not negligent, the deer-trapper cannot do with us as he wishes on account of this bait.’ Then they made a lair close to that bait laid down by the deer-trapper. Having made a lair there, they ate the bait laid down by the deer-trapper not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As they ate the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, they did not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, they did not fall into negligence. When they were not negligent, the deer-trapper could not do with them as he wished on account of that bait.

But it occurred to the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage: ‘This third herd of deer are as crafty and cunning as wizards and sorcerers. They eat this bait that is laid down, yet we do not know their coming or going. What if we surround this laid-down bait on all sides with large stake-nets, including the surrounding area; perhaps we might see the lair of the third herd of deer, where they can be caught.’ They surrounded that laid-down bait on all sides with large stake-nets, including the surrounding area. The deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage saw the lair of the third herd of deer, where they were caught. That is how, bhikkhus, even the third herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper.

Now, bhikkhus, the fourth herd of deer strategized thus: ‘The first herd of deer<collapse> ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. The second herd of deer strategized thus: “The first herd of deer<collapse> ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. What if we altogether abstain from that bait food; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, let us enter the forest region and dwell there.” Then they altogether abstained from that bait food<collapse>; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, they entered the forest region and dwelt there. But in the last month of the hot season, when grass and water ran out, their bodies reached a state of extreme emaciation. As their bodies reached extreme emaciation, their strength and energy diminished. When their strength and energy had diminished, they returned to that very bait laid down by the deer-trapper. There they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how even the second herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. The third herd of deer strategized thus: “The first herd of deer<collapse> ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. The second herd of deer strategized thus: ‘The first herd of deer<collapse> ate the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. What if we altogether abstain from that bait food; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, let us enter the forest region and dwell there.’ Then they altogether abstained from that bait food<collapse>; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, they entered the forest region and dwelt there. But in the last month of the hot season, when grass and water ran out, their bodies reached a state of extreme emaciation. As their bodies reached extreme emaciation, their strength and energy diminished. When their strength and energy had diminished, they returned to that very bait laid down by the deer-trapper. There they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them as he wished on account of that bait.</collapse> That is how even the second herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. What if we make a lair close to that bait laid down by the deer-trapper. Having made a lair there, let us eat the bait laid down by the deer-trapper not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As we eat the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, we will not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, we will not fall into negligence. When we are not negligent, the deer-trapper cannot do with us as he wishes on account of this bait.” Then they made a lair close to that bait laid down by the deer-trapper. Having made a lair there, they ate the bait laid down by the deer-trapper not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As they ate the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, they did not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, they did not fall into negligence. When they were not negligent, the deer-trapper could not do with them as he wished on account of that bait. But it occurred to the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage: “This third herd of deer are as crafty and cunning as wizards and sorcerers. They eat this bait that is laid down, yet we do not know their coming or going. What if we surround this laid-down bait on all sides with large stake-nets, including the surrounding area; perhaps we might see the lair of the third herd of deer, where they can be caught.” They surrounded that laid-down bait on all sides with large stake-nets, including the surrounding area. The deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage saw the lair of the third herd of deer, where they were caught. That is how even the third herd of deer failed to get free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper. What if we make a lair where the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage cannot go. Having made a lair there, let us eat the bait laid down by the deer-trapper not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As we eat the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, we will not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, we will not fall into negligence. When we are not negligent, the deer-trapper cannot do with us as he wishes on account of this bait.’ They made a lair where the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage could not go. Having made a lair there, they ate the bait laid down by the deer-trapper not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As they ate the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, they did not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, they did not fall into negligence. When they were not negligent, the deer-trapper could not do with them as he wished on account of that bait.

But it occurred to the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage: ‘This fourth herd of deer are as crafty and cunning as wizards and sorcerers. They eat this bait that is laid down, yet we do not know their coming or going. What if we surround this laid-down bait on all sides with large stake-nets, including the surrounding area; perhaps we might see the lair of the fourth herd of deer, where they can be caught.’ They surrounded that laid-down bait on all sides with large stake-nets, including the surrounding area. But, bhikkhus, the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage did not see the lair of the fourth herd of deer, where they could be caught. Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage: ‘If we |disturb::agitate, provoke [ghaṭṭeti]| the fourth herd of deer, being disturbed they will disturb others, and those being disturbed will disturb still others. In this way, all the deer herds will completely abandon this laid-down bait. What if we ignore the fourth herd of deer.’ So, bhikkhus, the deer-trapper and the deer-trapper’s entourage ignored the fourth herd of deer. That is how, bhikkhus, the fourth herd of deer got free from the psychic power and control of the deer-trapper.

I have given this simile, bhikkhus, to convey a meaning. And this is the meaning here:

‘Bait,’ bhikkhus, is a term for the five cords of sensual pleasure.

‘Deer-trapper,’ bhikkhus, is a term for |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| the |Evil One::profoundly immoral and wicked, having evil quality, epithet of Māra [pāpimant]|.

‘Deer-trapper’s entourage,’ bhikkhus, is a term for Māra’s assembly.

‘Herd of deer,’ bhikkhus, is a term for ascetics and brahmins.

#### Four Kinds of Ascetics and Brahmins

Now, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the first kind ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the |baits of the world::material delights, worldliness [lokāmisāni]| rushing in and infatuated with them. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, Māra did with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world. That is how, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the first kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. I say, bhikkhus, that the ascetics and brahmins of the first kind are comparable to that first herd of deer.

Now, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the second kind strategized thus: ‘The ascetics and brahmins of the first kind ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the baits of the world rushing in and infatuated with them. As they enjoyed taking food rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, Māra did with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world. That is how the ascetics and brahmins of the first kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. What if we altogether abstain from that bait and those baits of the world; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, let us enter the forest region and dwell there.’ Then they altogether abstained from that bait and those baits of the world; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, they entered the forest region and dwelt there. There, they subsisted on raw greens, or on wild millet, or on wild red rice, or on bark parings, or on water plants and slime, or on rice husk powder, or on rice water and pot scum, or on ground sesame, or on grass, or on cow dung. They subsisted on roots and fruits of the forest, eating fallen fruits.

But in the last month of the hot season, when grass and water ran out, their bodies reached a state of extreme emaciation. As their bodies reached extreme emaciation, their strength and energy diminished. When their strength and energy diminished, their deliverance of mind was lost. When their deliverance of mind was lost, they returned to that very bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world. There they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, Māra did with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world. That is how, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the second kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. I say, bhikkhus, that the ascetics and brahmins of the second kind are comparable to that second herd of deer.

Now, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the third kind strategized thus: ‘The ascetics and brahmins of the first kind ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the baits of the world <collapse>rushing in and infatuated with them. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, Māra did with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world.</collapse> That is how, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the first kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. The ascetics and brahmins of the second kind strategized thus: “The ascetics and brahmins of the first kind ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the baits of the world <collapse>rushing in and infatuated with them. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, Māra did with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world.</collapse> That is how the ascetics and brahmins of the first kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. What if we altogether abstain from that bait and those baits of the world; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, let us enter the forest region and dwell there.” Then they altogether abstained from that bait and those baits of the world; abstaining from that dangerous pleasure, they entered the forest region and dwelt there. There, they subsisted on raw greens <collapse>, or on wild millet, or on wild red rice, or on bark parings, or on water plants and slime, or on rice husk powder, or on rice water and pot scum, or on ground sesame, or on grass, or on cow dung. They subsisted on roots and fruits of the forest,</collapse> eating fallen fruits. But in the last month of the hot season, when grass and water ran out, their bodies reached a state of extreme emaciation. As their bodies reached extreme emaciation, their strength and energy diminished. When their strength and energy diminished, their deliverance of mind was lost. When their deliverance of mind was lost, they returned to that very bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world. There they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, Māra did with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world. That is how the ascetics and brahmins of the second kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. What if we make our dwelling place close to that bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world. Having made our dwelling place there, let us eat the bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As we eat the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, we will not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, we will not fall into negligence. When we are not negligent, Māra cannot do with us as he wishes on account of this bait and the baits of the world.’

Then they made their dwelling place close to that bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world. Having made their dwelling place there, they ate the bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As they ate the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, they did not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, they did not fall into negligence. When they were not negligent, Māra could not do with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world. But they held such views as these: ‘The world is |eternal::everlasting [sassata]|,’ or ‘the world is not eternal;’ ‘the world is finite,’ or ‘the world is infinite;’ ‘the |life force::life, soul [jīva]| and the body are the same,’ or ‘the life force is one thing, the body another;’ ‘after death, a |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’ That is how, bhikkhus, even the ascetics and brahmins of the third kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. I say, bhikkhus, that the ascetics and brahmins of the third kind are comparable to that third herd of deer.

Now, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the fourth kind strategized thus: ‘The ascetics and brahmins of the first kind ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the baits of the world <collapse>rushing in and infatuated with them. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence. When they were negligent, Māra did with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world.</collapse> That is how the ascetics and brahmins of the first kind failed to get free from the psychic power and control of Māra. The ascetics and brahmins of the second kind strategized thus: “The ascetics and brahmins of the first kind <collapse>ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the baits of the world rushing in and infatuated with them. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence.

The ascetics and brahmins of the third kind strategized thus: “The ascetics and brahmins of the first kind <collapse>ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the baits of the world rushing in and infatuated with them. As they ate the bait rushing in and infatuated with it, they became intoxicated. Being intoxicated, they fell into negligence.

The ascetics and brahmins of the second kind strategized thus: ‘The ascetics and brahmins of the first kind <collapse>ate the bait laid down by Māra along with the baits of the world rushing in and infatuated with them.

As we eat the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, we will not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, we will not fall into negligence. When we are not negligent, Māra cannot do with us as he wishes on account of this bait and the baits of the world.” Then they made their dwelling place close to that bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world. Having made their dwelling place there, they ate the bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As they ate the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, they did not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, they did not fall into negligence.

Then they made their dwelling place where Māra and Māra’s entourage cannot go. Having made their dwelling place there, they ate the bait laid down by Māra and the baits of the world not rushing in and not infatuated with it. As they ate the bait not rushing in and not infatuated with it, they did not become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, they did not fall into negligence. When they were not negligent, Māra could not do with them as he wished on account of that bait and those baits of the world. That is how, bhikkhus, the ascetics and brahmins of the fourth kind got free from the psychic power and control of Māra. I say, bhikkhus, that the ascetics and brahmins of the fourth kind are comparable to that fourth herd of deer.

#### Blinding Māra

And what, bhikkhus, is the place where Māra and Māra’s entourage cannot go? Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with uplifting joy and pleasure. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, with the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy, a bhikkhu dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and clearly aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has blinded Māra, who has gone beyond the Evil One’s sight, becoming invisible to him.
