Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Rājagaha::name of a city; capital of Magadha; lit. king's house [rājagaha]|, in the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground.

Then Prince |Abhaya::name of a prince; king Bimbisāra's son [abhaya]| went to where |Nigaṇṭha::epithet of Mahāvīra; lit. free from ties [nigaṇṭha]| Nāṭaputta was staying. After approaching, he paid homage to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and sat down to one side. As he was sitting there, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said to Prince Abhaya: “Come, Prince, |dispute::disprove, refute [āropeti]| the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama. Then a good report concerning you will spread about: ‘The doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, who is |of great supernormal power::of great spiritual power [mahiddhika]| and great might, has been disputed by the Prince Abhaya.’”

“But how, venerable sir, shall I dispute the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, who is of great supernormal power and great might?”

“Come, Prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say: ‘Venerable sir, would the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| utter speech that would be unwelcome and |disagreeable::unpleasant [amanāpa]| to others?’ If the ascetic Gotama, on being asked thus, answers: ‘Prince, the Tathāgata would utter speech that is unwelcome and disagreeable to others,’ then you should say to him: ‘Then, venerable sir, what is the difference between you and an ordinary person? For an ordinary person also would utter speech that is unwelcome and disagreeable to others.’ But if the ascetic Gotama, on being asked thus, answers: ‘No Prince, the Tathāgata would not utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others,’ then you should say to him: ‘Then, sir, how was |Devadatta::Devadatta was the Buddha’s cousin and a bhikkhu who, driven by ambition and envy, attempted to create a schism in the Saṅgha. [devadatta]| declared by you: “Devadatta is |destined for a miserable state::to be reborn in suffering [āpāyika]|, Devadatta is destined for |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|, and will |remain there for an aeon::lasting a world cycle, a vast cosmic time span [kappaṭṭha]|, incurable”? Devadatta was |angry::indignant, offended [kupita]| and |irritated::annoyed, displeased [anattamana]| with that speech of yours.’

When the ascetic Gotama is posed this two-pronged question by you, Prince, he will be able neither to spit it out nor to swallow it down. Just as if an iron spike were stuck in a man’s throat, so that he could neither spit it out nor swallow it down, so too, Prince, when the ascetic Gotama is posed this two-pronged question by you, he will be able neither to spit it out nor to swallow it down.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” Prince Abhaya replied to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. Then he rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right, he left and went to the Blessed One. Having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, he sat to one side.

As Prince Abhaya sat to one side, he looked at the sun and thought: “Today is not the time to dispute the Blessed One’s doctrine. Tomorrow, in my own home, I will dispute the Blessed One’s doctrine.” So he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, let the Blessed One with three others accept a meal from me tomorrow.” The Blessed One consented in silence.

Then Prince Abhaya, having received the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.

After the night had passed, early in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his alms bowl and outer robe, and went to Prince Abhaya’s residence. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then Prince Abhaya, with his own hands, served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of excellent food.

Then Prince Abhaya took a low seat and sat down to one side after the Blessed One had finished his meal and put away his bowl. Seated to one side, Prince Abhaya said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, would the Tathāgata utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others?”

“There is no |categorical::one-sided [ekaṁsena]| answer to that, Prince.”

“Then, venerable sir, the Nigaṇṭhas have lost in this.”

“Why do you say this, prince: ‘Then, venerable sir, the Nigaṇṭhas have lost in this’?”

“Here, venerable sir, I went to where Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was staying. After approaching, I paid homage to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and sat down to one side. As I was sitting there, venerable sir, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said to me: ‘Come, Prince, dispute the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama. Then a good report concerning you will spread about: The doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, who is of great supernormal power and great might, has been disputed by the Prince Abhaya.’ When this was said, venerable sir, I said to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta: ‘But how, venerable sir, shall I dispute the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, who is of great supernormal power and great might?’ ‘Come, Prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say: “Venerable sir, would the Tathāgata utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others?” If the ascetic Gotama, on being asked thus, answers: “Prince, the Tathāgata would utter speech that is unwelcome and disagreeable to others,” then you should say to him: “Then, venerable sir, what is the difference between you and an ordinary person? For an ordinary person also would utter speech that is unwelcome and disagreeable to others.” But if, the ascetic Gotama, on being asked thus, answers: “No Prince, the Tathāgata would not utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others,” then you should say to him: “Then, sir, how was Devadatta declared by you: ‘Devadatta is destined for a miserable state, Devadatta is destined for hell, and will remain there for an aeon, incurable.’ Devadatta was angry and irritated with that speech of yours.” When the ascetic Gotama is posed this two-pronged question by you, Prince, he will be able neither to spit it out nor to swallow it down. Just as if an iron spike were stuck in a man’s throat, so that he could neither spit it out nor swallow it down, so too, Prince, when the ascetic Gotama is posed this two-pronged question by you, he will be able neither to spit it out nor to swallow it down.’”

Now on that occasion, a young, tender infant |lying on his back::lying supine [uttānaseyyaka]|, was resting on Prince Abhaya’s lap. Then the Blessed One said to Prince Abhaya: “What do you think, Prince? If this boy, through your negligence or the nurse’s negligence, were to put a stick or a pebble in his mouth, what would you do to him?”

“I would take it out, venerable sir. If, venerable sir, I could not take it out at once, holding his head with my left hand and hooking a finger of my right hand, I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood. Why is that? Because I have |compassion::benevolence, concern, gentle regard [anukampa]| for the boy, venerable sir.”

• “So too, Prince, such speech as the Tathāgata knows to be untrue, incorrect, and |unbeneficial::meaningless, useless [anatthasaṁhita]|, and which is also unwelcome and disagreeable to others—such speech the Tathāgata does not utter.
• Such speech as the Tathāgata knows to be true and correct but unbeneficial, and which is also unwelcome and disagreeable to others—such speech the Tathāgata does not utter.
• Such speech as the Tathāgata knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, but which is unwelcome and disagreeable to others—the Tathāgata knows the time to use such speech.
• Such speech as the Tathāgata knows to be untrue, incorrect, and unbeneficial, but which is welcome and |agreeable::pleasant, likable [manāpa]| to others—such speech the Tathāgata does not utter.
• Such speech as the Tathāgata knows to be true and correct but unbeneficial, and which is welcome and agreeable to others—such speech the Tathāgata does not utter.
• Such speech as the Tathāgata knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, and which is welcome and agreeable to others—the Tathāgata knows the time to use such speech.

Why is that? Because the Tathāgata has compassion for beings, Prince.”

“Venerable sir, when these learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned householders, and learned ascetics, having formulated a question, then go to the Blessed One and pose it, is it already thought out in the Blessed One’s mind beforehand: ‘Those who approach me and ask thus, I will answer them thus’? Or does it occur to the Tathāgata on the spot?”

“As to that, Prince, I will ask you a question. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, Prince, are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?”

“Yes, venerable sir, I am skilled in the various parts of a chariot.”

“What do you think, Prince, if people were to approach you and ask: ‘What is the name of this chariot component?’ Is it already thought out in the Blessed One’s mind beforehand: ‘Those who approach me and ask thus, I will answer them thus’? Or would it occur to you on the spot?”

“Venerable sir, I am renowned as a charioteer, skilled in the various parts of a chariot. All the various parts of a chariot are well known to me. That answer would occur to me on the spot.”

“So too, Prince, when these learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned householders, and learned ascetics, having formulated a question, then approach the Tathāgata and pose it, the answer occurs to the Tathāgata on the spot. Why is that? Because, Prince, the element of the |Dhamma::the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| has been |thoroughly penetrated::completely comprehended [suppaṭividdha]| by the Tathāgata; and because of his thorough penetration of the element of the Dhamma, the answer occurs to the Tathāgata on the spot.”

When this was said, Prince Abhaya said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, venerable sir! <collapse>Excellent, venerable sir! Just as if one were to set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms — even so, venerable sir, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by the Blessed One in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus.</collapse> May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life.”
