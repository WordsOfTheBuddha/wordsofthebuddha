Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. There, he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu makes a declaration of |final knowledge::spiritual insight of the complete wearing away of the mental defilements; full awakening [aññā]| thus: ‘Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.’

#### Four Modes of Expression

Bhikkhus, that bhikkhu’s statement should neither be approved nor rejected. Without approving or rejecting it, a question should be asked: ‘Friend, there are these four modes of expression rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|, the perfectly Awakened One. What four? One speaks of the seen as it was seen; one speaks of the heard as it was heard; one speaks of the sensed as it was sensed; one speaks of the cognized as it was cognized. These, friend, are the four modes of expression rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One. Knowing in what way and seeing in what way regarding these four modes of expression is the venerable one’s mind |liberated::freed [vimutta]| from the |mental defilements::mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]| through |not clinging::not grasping, not holding (onto), detaching (from), not taking possession (of); lit. not taking near [anupāda]|?

Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, having achieved the highest goal, |having exhausted the fetter of existence::who has worn away the bonds of continued conditional existence, i.e. the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojana]|, having been liberated through complete comprehension, it is natural for them to answer: ‘Friend, regarding the seen, I abide not attracted, not repelled, |disengaged::detached, independent [anissita]|, not bound, freed, disentangled, with a mind rid of barriers. Regarding the heard, regarding the sensed, regarding the cognized, I abide not attracted, not repelled, disengaged, not bound, freed, disentangled, with a mind rid of barriers. It is knowing thus, friend, and seeing thus, regarding these four modes of expression, that my mind is liberated from the mental defilements through not clinging.’

Saying ‘good,’ one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s statement. Having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhu’s statement saying ‘good,’ a further question should be asked:

#### Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging

‘Friend, there are these |five aggregates that are subject to clinging::the physical and mental heaps that are appropriated, grasped at, or taken as self; the fivefold collection of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness bound up with attachment [pañca + upādānakkhandha]|, rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|, the perfectly Awakened One. What five? Namely: the |form aggregate subject to clinging::attaching to the physical body or external objects as part of one’s identity or as something that provides lasting satisfaction [rūpupādānakkhandha]|, the |feeling aggregate subject to clinging::becoming attached to feelings of pleasure, resisting or rejecting feelings of pain, and becoming indifferent or unaware of neutral feelings. This clinging leads to grasping after pleasant sensations, aversion to painful ones, and ignorance of neutral feelings [vedanupādānakkhandha]|, the |perception aggregate subject to clinging::becoming attached to how one interprets and perceives things — believing one’s perceptions are fixed, true, or part of our self. It can also involve attaching to concepts, labels, and judgments that arise from perception. [saññupādānakkhandha]|, the |intentional constructs aggregate subject to clinging::attachment to, or identification with one’s intentions, emotions, and decisions as part of “who I am.” This creates a strong sense of self around one’s volitional activities, as if “I am the one who wills, chooses, or acts.” [saṅkhārupādānakkhandha]|, and the |consciousness aggregate subject to clinging::attachment to, or identification with, quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind] [viññāṇupādānakkhandha]|. These, friend, are the five aggregates that are subject to clinging, rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One. Knowing in what way and seeing in what way regarding these five aggregates is the venerable one’s mind liberated from the mental defilements through not clinging?’

Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu whose mental defilements have ended, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, having achieved the highest goal, having exhausted the fetter of existence, having been liberated through complete comprehension, it is natural for them to answer: ‘Friend, having known form to be |feeble::devoid of strength, weak [abala]|, |fading::having a disappearing nature [virāguna]|, and |unreliable::not consoling, not trustworthy [anassāsika]|, with the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of |engaging and grasping::approaching and clinging, going near and grabbing hold [upāyūpādāna]| regarding form, of mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies regarding form, I understand that my mind is liberated. Having known feeling, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness to be feeble, fading, and unreliable, with the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of engaging and grasping regarding feeling, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness, of mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies regarding feeling, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness, I understand that my mind is liberated. It is knowing thus, friend, and seeing thus, regarding these five aggregates that are subject to clinging, that my mind is liberated from the mental defilements through not clinging.’

Saying ‘good,’ one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s statement. Having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhu’s statement saying ‘good,’ a further question should be asked:

#### Six Elements

‘Friend, there are these six elements rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One. What six? The |earth element::whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]|, the |water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|, the |fire element::whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]|, the |wind element::whatever internal or external that is airy, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [vāyodhātu]|, the |space element::whatever internal or external that is open, spacious, unobstructed, accommodating, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [ākāsadhātu]|, and the |consciousness element::whatever internal or external that is knowing, cognizing, recognizing, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [viññāṇadhātu]|. These, friend, are the six elements rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One. Knowing in what way and seeing in what way regarding these six elements is the venerable one’s mind liberated from the mental defilements through not clinging?’

Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu whose mental defilements have ended, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, having achieved the highest goal, having exhausted the fetter of existence, having been liberated through complete comprehension, it is natural for them to answer: ‘Friend, I do not regard the earth element as |personal::related to oneself, self, essence [atta]|, nor take anything dependent on the earth element as personal. With the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of engaging and grasping, of mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies based on the earth element, I understand that my mind is liberated. Regarding the water element, regarding the fire element, regarding the wind element, regarding the space element, regarding the consciousness element, I do not regard them as personal, nor take anything dependent on them as personal. With the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of engaging and grasping, of mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies based on them, I understand that my mind is liberated. It is knowing thus, friend, and seeing thus, regarding these six elements that my mind is liberated from the mental defilements through not clinging.’

Saying ‘good,’ one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s statement. Having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhu’s statement saying ‘good,’ a further question should be asked:

#### Six Internal and External Bases

‘Friend, there are these six internal and external bases rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One. What six? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odors, the tongue and flavors, the body and tactile sensations, the mind and phenomena. These, friend, are the six internal and external bases rightly declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One. Knowing in what way and seeing in what way regarding these six internal and external bases is the venerable one’s mind liberated from the mental defilements through not clinging?’

Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu whose mental defilements have ended, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, having achieved the highest goal, having exhausted the fetter of existence, having been liberated through complete comprehension, it is natural for them to answer: ‘Friend, regarding the eye, |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]|, |eye-consciousness::awareness of visible forms; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [cakkhuviññāṇa]|, and phenomena to be cognized by eye-consciousness: whatever desire, lust, delight, craving, engaging and grasping, mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies there are—through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of these, I understand that my mind is liberated. Regarding the ear, |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]|, |ear-consciousness::auditory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [sotaviññāṇa]|, and phenomena to be cognized by ear-consciousness<collapse>: whatever desire, lust, delight, craving, engaging and grasping, mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies there are—through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of these, I understand that my mind is liberated.</collapse> Regarding the nose, |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]|, |nose-consciousness::olfactory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [ghānaviññāṇa]|, and phenomena to be cognized by nose-consciousness<collapse>: whatever desire, lust, delight, craving, engaging and grasping, mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies there are—through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of these, I understand that my mind is liberated.</collapse> Regarding the tongue, |tastes::flavors experienced through the tongue such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes like umami or astringency—any gustatory experience that can become an object of craving, indulgence, comfort, or sensory delight [rasā]|, |tongue-consciousness::gustatory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [jivhāviññāṇa]|, and phenomena to be cognized by tongue-consciousness<collapse>: whatever desire, lust, delight, craving, engaging and grasping, mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies there are—through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of these, I understand that my mind is liberated.</collapse> Regarding the body, |tangible objects::tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]|, |body-consciousness::tactile awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [kāyaviññāṇa]|, and phenomena to be cognized by body-consciousness<collapse>: whatever desire, lust, delight, craving, engaging and grasping, mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies there are—through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of these, I understand that my mind is liberated.</collapse> Regarding the mind, |mental objects::thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions, intentions, perceptions, concepts, beliefs, mental images, or constructs—any mental phenomena that arises internally and can become an object of clinging, identity, projection, craving, or aversion [dhamme]|, |mind-consciousness::mental awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [manoviññāṇa]|, and phenomena to be cognized by mind-consciousness: whatever desire, lust, delight, craving, engaging and grasping, mental standpoints, attachments, and underlying tendencies there are—through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of these, I understand that my mind is liberated. It is knowing thus, friend, and seeing thus, regarding these six internal and external bases that my mind is liberated from the mental defilements through not clinging.’

Saying ‘good,’ one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s statement. Having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhu’s statement saying ‘good,’ a further question should be asked:

#### I-Making, Mine-Making, and Conceit

‘Knowing in what way and seeing in what way, with regard to this consciousness-containing body and all external signs, have |I-making::self-identification, concept of individuality, I am this, this is me [ahaṅkāra]|, |mine-making::possessiveness, attachment, self-interest [mamaṅkāra]|, and the underlying tendency to |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]| been fully |uprooted::eradicated [samūhata]| in the venerable one?’

Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu whose mental defilements have ended, who has fulfilled the spiritual life, who has done what had to be done, having put down the burden, having achieved the highest goal, having exhausted the fetter of existence, having been liberated through complete comprehension, it is natural for them to answer: ‘Friend, formerly, when I was living the household life, I was ignorant. The |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| or a disciple of the Tathāgata taught the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| to me. Having heard that Dhamma, I acquired faith in the Tathāgata. Endowed with that faith, I reflected thus:

“The household life is |confined::crowded, cramped [sambādha]|, a dusty path; life gone forth is wide open. While dwelling in a house, it is not easy to live the spiritual life completely perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the |ochre robes::organic brown color robes; monks’ robes [kāsāya]|, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.”

Then, friend, at a later time, having given up a small or large fortune, having left behind a small or large circle of relatives, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness. Having gone forth, I undertook the bhikkhu’s training and way of life. I abandoned the destruction of life and refrained from killing living beings. Having laid aside sticks and weapons, |conscientious::sensitive, with an internal sense of carefulness and concern for the welfare of others [lajjī]| and |compassionate::sympathetic [dayāpanna]|, I dwelt with sympathy for the welfare of all living beings. I abandoned the taking of what is not given and refrained from taking what is not given. Taking only what is given, expecting only what is given, by not stealing, I dwelt in purity. I abandoned unchastity and observed celibacy, living apart, and refrained from sexual activity, the common person’s practice. I abandoned false speech and refrained from lying. I was truthful, adhered to truth, trustworthy, dependable, and did not deceive the world. I abandoned divisive speech and refrained from divisive speech. Having heard something here, I did not repeat it over there to cause division; and having heard something over there, I did not repeat it here to stir conflict. Thus, I was one who reconciles those who are divided, a promoter of harmony, who delights in concord, cherishes unity, rejoices in harmony, and speaks words that bring people together. I abandoned harsh speech and refrained from harsh speech. I spoke such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, affectionate, heart-touching, refined, pleasing and agreeable to many. I abandoned frivolous chatter and refrained from frivolous chatter. I spoke at the right time, spoke what is true, spoke what is beneficial, spoke on the Dhamma and spoke on the |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|. My words were worth treasuring, spoken at an appropriate time, with basis, with defined purpose, and beneficial.

I refrained from injuring seeds and plants.
I practiced eating only one meal a day, abstained from eating at night, and refrained from untimely eating.
I refrained from dancing, singing, music, and watching shows.
I refrained from wearing garlands, using perfumes, oils, and beautifying the body with ornaments.
I refrained from accepting high and luxurious beds.
I refrained from accepting gold and silver.
I refrained from accepting uncooked grain.
I refrained from accepting raw meat.
I refrained from accepting women or young girls.
I refrained from accepting female and male servants.
I refrained from accepting goats and sheep.
I refrained from accepting chickens and pigs.
I refrained from accepting elephants, cows, horses, and mares.
I refrained from accepting fields and plots of land.
I refrained from running errands or acting as a messenger.
I refrained from trading.
I refrained from using false scales, false weights, and false measures.
I refrained from bribing, defrauding, counterfeiting, and dishonest dealing.
I refrained from cutting, killing, tying, highway robbery, stealing, and armed robbery.

I was content with robes to cover the body and alms food to sustain the belly. Wherever I set out, I set out taking only these requisites with me. Just as a bird, wherever it flies, flies with only the burden of its wings, so too I was content with robes to cover the body and alms food to sustain the belly. Wherever I set out, I set out taking only these requisites with me. Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, I personally experienced |blameless happiness::pleasure of being faultless [anavajjasukha]| within.

Having seen a form with the eye, I did not |grasp at its prominent features::focusing on its external characteristics [nimittaggāhī]| and was not |enticed by the details::focused on the secondary characteristics [anubyañjanaggāhī]|. For if I were to dwell with the eye faculty unguarded, |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| states of |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| might stream in; therefore, I practiced restraint in this regard, I guarded the eye faculty, and I undertook the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear<collapse>, I did not grasp at its prominent features and was not enticed by the details. For if I were to dwell with the ear faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in; therefore, I practiced restraint in this regard, I guarded the ear faculty, and I undertook the restraint of the ear faculty.</collapse> Having smelled an odor with the nose<collapse>, I did not grasp at its prominent features and was not enticed by the details. For if I were to dwell with the nose faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in; therefore, I practiced restraint in this regard, I guarded the nose faculty, and I undertook the restraint of the nose faculty.</collapse> Having tasted a flavor with the tongue<collapse>, I did not grasp at its prominent features and was not enticed by the details. For if I were to dwell with the tongue faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in; therefore, I practiced restraint in this regard, I guarded the tongue faculty, and I undertook the restraint of the tongue faculty.</collapse> Having touched a tangible object with the body<collapse>, I did not grasp at its prominent features and was not enticed by the details. For if I were to dwell with the body faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in; therefore, I practiced restraint in this regard, I guarded the body faculty, and I undertook the restraint of the body faculty.</collapse> Having cognized a mental object with the mind, I did not grasp at its prominent features and was not enticed by the details. For if I were to dwell with the mind faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of craving and distress might stream in; therefore, I practiced restraint in this regard, I guarded the mind faculty, and I undertook the restraint of the mind faculty. Endowed with this noble sense restraint, I personally experienced |undiluted happiness::unadulterated ease [abyāsekasukha]| within.

I acted with |full awareness::clear comprehension [sampajāna]| when going forward and returning; I acted with full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; I acted with full awareness when flexing and extending my limbs; I acted with full awareness while wearing my robes and carrying my outer robe and bowl; I acted with full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; I acted with full awareness when defecating and urinating; I acted with full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, endowed with this noble aggregate of |contentment::satisfaction [santuṭṭhi]|, endowed with this noble aggregate of restraint of the senses, endowed with this noble aggregate of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| and |full awareness::attentiveness, clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]|, I resorted to a secluded lodging—in the forest, at the foot of a tree, on a mountain, in a ravine, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest thicket, in the open air, on a heap of straw. After the meal, having returned from alms round, I sat down cross-legged, keeping my body upright, establishing mindfulness as the first priority.

Having given up |craving::greediness, wanting, yearning [abhijjhā]| for the world, I dwelt with a mind free from craving; I purified my mind of craving. Having given up |ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construct fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]|, I dwelt with a mind free from ill will, with sympathy for the welfare of all living beings; I purified my mind of |ill will and hatred::enmity and aversion [byāpādapadosa]|. Having given up |dullness and drowsiness::lack of mental clarity or alertness, mental sluggishness, lethargy, sleepiness lit. stiffness (of mind/body due to tiredness) [thinamiddha]|, I dwelt free from dullness and drowsiness, |perceptive of light::aware of brightness [ālokasaññī]|, |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of themselves [sata]| and |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]|; I purified my mind of dullness and drowsiness. Having given up |restlessness and worry::agitation and edginess, distraction, fidgeting, fiddling, uneasiness [uddhaccakukkucca]|, I dwelt unagitated, with an inwardly peaceful mind; I purified my mind of restlessness and worry. Having given up |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness wrt suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering [vicikiccha]|, I dwelt having crossed beyond doubt, without doubt about wholesome states; I purified my mind from doubt.

Having given up the five hindrances, |impurities::blemishes, flaws, imperfections [upakkilese]| of the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, I entered and dwelt in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. Furthermore, bhikkhus, with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, I entered and dwelt in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|<collapse>. Furthermore, with the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy, I dwelt |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body; [and] entered and dwelt in</collapse> the third jhāna<collapse>, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ [or] with the abandoning of [bodily] pleasure and |pain::discomfort, unpleasantness. In this context, this is referring to bodily pain or sharp sensations. [dukkha]|, and with the prior settling down of |mental pleasure and displeasure::the duality of positive and negative states of mind; mental happiness and mental pain [somanassadomanassa]|,</collapse> I entered and dwelt in the fourth jhāna<collapse>, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant</collapse>.

Thus, with my mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, I directed my mind towards the knowledge of eradicating the mental defilements. I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,’ ‘This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,’ ‘This is the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|,’ ‘This is the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.’ I directly knew as it actually is: ‘These are the mental defilements.’ I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is the arising of mental defilements.’ I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is the end of mental defilements.’ I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is the way of practice leading to the end of mental defilements.’

Knowing and seeing thus, my mind was liberated from the |taint of sensual desire::oozing sensual desire [kāmāsava]|, from the |taint of becoming::effluent of being, taint of existence [bhavāsava]|, and from the |taint of ignorance::taint of not knowing how things have come to be, illusion of knowing, distorted perception [avijjāsava]|. In me, liberated, there arose the knowledge of liberation: ‘Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.’ This is how, friend, for one who knows and sees, in this very life, with regard to this consciousness-containing body and all external signs, there is no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit.

Saying ‘good,’ one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s statement. Having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhu’s statement saying ‘good,’ one should speak to him thus: ‘Friend, it is our good fortune, truly our great fortune, that we have such a companion in the spiritual life as the venerable one.’”

The Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
