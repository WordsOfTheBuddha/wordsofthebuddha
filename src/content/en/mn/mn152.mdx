title: Indriyabhāvanā sutta - Development of the Faculties
description: When a young brahmin claims that avoiding sights and sounds constitutes development of the faculties, the Buddha reveals that true cultivation lies in understanding pleasant and unpleasant experiences as conditioned and transient through an examination of the six sense bases. He contrasts the trainee, still swayed by agreeable and disagreeable, with the noble one who has attained mastery over perception.

Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Gajaṅgala::name of a town [gajaṅgalā]| in the bamboo grove.

Then the young brahmin Uttara, a student of the brahmin Pārāsiviya, approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One. After having engaged in courteous and polite conversation, he sat to one side. As he was seated to one side, the Blessed One said this to the young brahmin Uttara, student of the brahmin Pārāsiviya: “Uttara, does the brahmin Pārāsiviya teach the development of the faculties to his disciples?”

“Sir Gotama, the brahmin Pārāsiviya does teach the development of the faculties to his disciples.”

“In what way, Uttara, does the brahmin Pārāsiviya teach the development of the faculties to his disciples?”

“Here, [there is the case], sir Gotama, where one does not see forms with the eye, and one does not hear sounds with the ear.^[1]^ It is in this way, sir Gotama, that the brahmin Pārāsiviya teaches the development of the faculties to his disciples.”

“If that is so, Uttara, then a blind man must have developed faculties, and a deaf man must have developed faculties, according to the statement of the brahmin Pārāsiviya. For a blind man, Uttara, does not see forms with the eye, and a deaf man does not hear sounds with the ear.” When this was said, the young brahmin Uttara, student of the brahmin Pārāsiviya, sat silent, dejected, with shoulders drooping and head down, reflecting, unable to respond.

Then the Blessed One, knowing that the young brahmin Uttara was silent, dejected, with shoulders drooping and head down, reflecting, and unable to respond, addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, the brahmin Pārāsiviya teaches the development of the faculties to his disciples in one way; but the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]| is different.”

“This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Accomplished One, for the Blessed One to teach the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya.”

“Then listen to this, Ānanda, and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“And how, Ānanda, is there the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye, there arises in him what is |agreeable::pleasant, likable [manāpa]|, there arises what is |disagreeable::unpleasant [amanāpa]|, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He |discerns::distinguishes, understands, knows clearly [pajānāti]| thus: ‘Whatever has arisen in me that is agreeable, disagreeable, or both agreeable and disagreeable—that is |conditioned::constructed, created, fabricated [saṅkhata]|, |coarse::gross [oḷārika]|, and |dependently arisen::casually produced, arisen together from a cause [paṭiccasamuppanna]|. But this is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|.’ For him, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity |remains::is established, stands firm [saṇṭhāti]|. Just as, Ānanda, a man with good eyesight might open his eyes and shut them, or shut his eyes and open them; in the same way, Ānanda, just as quickly, just as rapidly, and with no difficulty at all, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. This, Ānanda, is called the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya with regard to forms cognizable by the eye.

Furthermore, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu hears a sound with the ear, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He discerns thus: ‘Whatever has arisen in me that is agreeable, disagreeable, or both agreeable and disagreeable—that is conditioned, coarse, and dependently arisen. But this is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: equanimity.’ For him, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. Just as, Ānanda, a strong man might snap his fingers with no difficulty; in the same way, Ānanda, just as quickly, just as rapidly, and with no difficulty at all, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. This, Ānanda, is called the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya with regard to sounds cognizable by the ear.

Furthermore, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu smells an odor with the nose, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He discerns thus: ‘Whatever has arisen in me that is agreeable, disagreeable, or both agreeable and disagreeable—that is conditioned, coarse, and dependently arisen. But this is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: equanimity.’ For him, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. Just as, Ānanda, water drops on a slightly sloping lotus leaf roll off and do not remain; in the same way, Ānanda, just as quickly, just as rapidly, and with no difficulty at all, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. This, Ānanda, is called the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya with regard to odors cognizable by the nose.

Furthermore, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu tastes a flavor with the tongue, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He discerns thus: ‘Whatever has arisen in me that is agreeable, disagreeable, or both agreeable and disagreeable—that is conditioned, coarse, and dependently arisen. But this is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: equanimity.’ For him, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. Just as, Ānanda, a strong man might collect a ball of saliva at the tip of his tongue and having collected it, might spit it out with no difficulty; in the same way, Ānanda, just as quickly, just as rapidly, and with no difficulty at all, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. This, Ānanda, is called the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya with regard to flavors cognizable by the tongue.

Furthermore, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu touches a |tangible object::a tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, or pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]| with the body, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He discerns thus: ‘Whatever has arisen in me that is agreeable, disagreeable, or both agreeable and disagreeable—that is conditioned, coarse, and dependently arisen. But this is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: equanimity.’ For him, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. Just as, Ānanda, a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm; in the same way, Ānanda, just as quickly, just as rapidly, and with no difficulty at all, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. This, Ānanda, is called the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya with regard to tangible objects cognizable by the body.

Furthermore, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu cognizes a mental object with the mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He discerns thus: ‘Whatever has arisen in me that is agreeable, disagreeable, or both agreeable and disagreeable—that is conditioned, coarse, and dependently arisen. But this is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: equanimity.’ For him, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. Just as, Ānanda, if a strong man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron pan heated for a whole day, the falling of the water drops might be slow but they would quickly evaporate, dry up, and disappear; in the same way, Ānanda, just as quickly, just as rapidly, and with no difficulty at all, the arisen agreeable, the arisen disagreeable, or the arisen both agreeable and disagreeable ceases, and equanimity remains. This, Ānanda, is called the unsurpassed development of the faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya with regard to mental objects cognizable by the mind.

And how, Ānanda, is one a |trainee::learner, one of the seven stages of a noble person before full awakening [sekha]| who is walking the path? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He |is troubled::is perturbed [aṭṭīyati]|, |ashamed::feels embarrassed [harāyati]|, |detests::feels disgusted by [jigucchati]| that arisen agreeable, that arisen disagreeable, or that arisen both agreeable and disagreeable. When he hears a sound with the ear, smells an odor with the nose, tastes a flavor with the tongue, touches a tangible object with the body, or cognizes a mental object with the mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He is troubled, ashamed, and detests that arisen agreeable, that arisen disagreeable, or that arisen both agreeable and disagreeable. It is in this way, Ānanda, that one is a trainee who is walking the path.

And how, Ānanda, is one a Noble One with developed faculties? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the agreeable in the |disagreeable::lit. against the slope [paṭikūla]|,’ he dwells perceiving the agreeable in the disagreeable. If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the disagreeable in the |agreeable::attractive, pleasant [appaṭikūla]|,’ he dwells perceiving the disagreeable in the agreeable. If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the agreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable,’ he dwells perceiving the agreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable. If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the disagreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable,’ he dwells perceiving the disagreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable. If he wishes: ‘May I dwell having completely avoided both the agreeable and the disagreeable, |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]|, and |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]|,’ he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware in that case.

Furthermore, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu hears a sound with the ear, smells an odor with the nose, tastes a flavor with the tongue, touches a tangible object with the body, or cognizes a mental object with the mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, or there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the agreeable in the disagreeable,’ he dwells perceiving the agreeable in the disagreeable. “If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the disagreeable in the agreeable,’ he dwells perceiving the disagreeable in the agreeable. “If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the agreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable,’ he dwells perceiving the agreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable. “If he wishes: ‘May I dwell perceiving the disagreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable,’ he dwells perceiving the disagreeable in both the agreeable and disagreeable. “If he wishes: ‘May I dwell having completely avoided both the agreeable and the disagreeable, equanimous, mindful, and fully aware,’ he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware in that case. It is in this way, Ānanda, that one is a Noble One with developed faculties.

Thus, Ānanda, I have taught the unsurpassed development of the sense faculties in the Noble Ones’ Vinaya; I have taught the trainee who is walking the path; and I have taught the Noble One with developed faculties.

What a teacher should do out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, I have done for you, Ānanda. Here are these roots of trees, here are these empty huts. Meditate, Ānanda, do not be negligent; lest you later regret it. This is our instruction to you.”

The Blessed One said this. The venerable Ānanda was delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.
