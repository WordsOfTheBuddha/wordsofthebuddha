Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Uruvel캐 on the bank of the river Nera침jar캐 at the root of the Bodhi tree, having just attained full awakening. Then, for seven days, the Blessed One sat in one posture experiencing the bliss of liberation. At the end of those seven days, the Blessed One, emerging from that stillness of mind, during the last watch of the night, thoroughly paid attention to dependent co-arising in both forward and reverse order:

This being, that becomes; from the arising of this, that arises. That is: from ignorance as a condition, formations arise; from formations as a condition, consciousness arises; from consciousness as a condition, name-and-form arises; from name-and-form as a condition, the six sense bases arise; from the six sense bases as a condition, contact arises; from contact as a condition, feeling arises; from feeling as a condition, craving arises; from craving as a condition, clinging arises; from clinging as a condition, continued existence comes to be; from continued existence as a condition, birth comes to be; from birth as a condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.

But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form cease; with the cessation of name-and-form, the six sense bases cease; with the cessation of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases; with the cessation of becoming, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus, there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"When the nature of things becomes evident,
to the Brahmin meditating with continuous effort;
He persists dispelling M캐ra's army,
as the sun illuminating the sky.
