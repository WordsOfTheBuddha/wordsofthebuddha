Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. Now, at that time, King Pasenadi of Kosala was staying together with Queen Mallikā in the upper palace. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala said to Queen Mallikā: "Mallikā, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?"

"There is indeed no one, Great King, dearer to me than myself. But for you, Great King, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?" "For me too, Mallikā, there is indeed no one dearer than myself."

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having descended from the palace, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said this to the Blessed One:

Here, venerable sir, while I was staying together with Queen Mallikā in the upper palace, I said this to Queen Mallikā: "Mallikā, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?" When this was said, Queen Mallikā said this to me: "Great King, there is indeed no one dearer to me than myself. But for you, Great King, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?" When this was said, venerable sir, I said this to Queen Mallikā: "For me too, Mallikā, there is indeed no one dearer than myself."

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"Having surveyed all directions with the mind,
One finds nothing anywhere dearer than oneself;
Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear,
Therefore, one desiring for their own welfare should not harm others."
