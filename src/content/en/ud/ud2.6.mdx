Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, a certain wanderer had a young brahmin wife, who was pregnant and about to give birth. Then that female wanderer said to that wanderer: “Go, brahmin, bring oil for me to use when I have given birth.”

When this was said, that wanderer said to the female wanderer: “But from where, dear, could I bring oil?” Then for a second time, the female wanderer said this to that wanderer: “Go, brahmin, bring oil for me to use when I have given birth.” For a second time, that wanderer said to the female wanderer: “But from where, dear, could I bring oil?” Then for a third time, the female wanderer said this to that wanderer: “Go, brahmin, bring oil for me to use when I have given birth.”

Now at that time, ghee and oil were being offered to any ascetic or brahmin at the storehouse of king Pasenadi of Kosala, but only to drink there, not to take away.

Then it occurred to that wanderer: “At the storehouse of King Pasenadi of Kosala, ghee and oil are offered to any ascetic or brahmin, but only to drink there, not to take away. What if I were to go to the royal storehouse, drink as much oil as I need, return home, regurgitate it, and give it to her for use after she has given birth?”

Then that wanderer went to the storehouse of King Pasenadi of Kosala, drank as much oil as he needed, and returned home. But he was unable either to bring it up or to pass it out. Experiencing intense, harsh, sharp, and piercing pains, he writhed and twisted in agony.

Then, the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, took his alms bowl and outer robe and entered Sāvatthi for alms. He saw that wanderer tormented by intense, harsh, sharp, and piercing pains, writhing and twisting in agony.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Happy indeed are those |with nothing::without possessions; epithet of an arahant [akiñcana]|,
those |with perfect knowledge::who has complete understanding [vedagū]| are people with nothing;
But see how the |one with possession::who has baggage, who has worldly attachment [sakiñcana]| |suffers hardship::is upset, is irritated, is tormented [vihaññamāna]|,
his mind |entangled with::bound to, tied up with [paṭibandha]| others.”
