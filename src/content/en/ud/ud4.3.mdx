Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was wandering on a walking tour in the Kosala region together with a large |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. Then, the Blessed One stepped off the road and approached the foot of a certain tree. Having drawn near, he sat down on the seat that had been prepared.

Then a certain cowherd approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While that cowherd was seated to one side, the Blessed One gave him a talk on the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|—instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening him.

Then that cowherd, having been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One’s talk on the Dhamma, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented in silence. Then that cowherd, having received the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.

Then, when the night had passed, that cowherd, having prepared abundant thick milk porridge and |fresh ghee::clarified butter [sappi]| in his own residence, informed the Blessed One, saying: “It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready.”

Then the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, taking his alms bowl and outer robe, went to the residence of that cowherd together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat. Then that cowherd, with his own hands, served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with thick milk porridge and fresh ghee. Then that cowherd took a low seat and sat down to one side after the Blessed One had finished his meal and put away his bowl. Then, when that cowherd was seated to one side, the Blessed One, having instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened him with a talk on the Dhamma, rose from his seat and departed. Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, a certain man deprived that cowherd of life near the village boundary.

Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the cowherd who today, with his own hands, served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with thick milk porridge and fresh ghee—venerable sir, it is said that this cowherd has been deprived of life by a certain man near the village boundary.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy,
or a hostile person may do to another hostile person;
A mind that is |wrongly oriented::badly directed [micchāpaṇihita]|,
inflicts on oneself even greater harm.”
