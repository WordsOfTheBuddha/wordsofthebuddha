Thus have I heard — At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, by and large, the people of Sāvatthi were excessively clinging to sensual pleasures—|infatuated by::inflamed by, enamoured by [rattā]|, desirous for, bound by, fixated with, attached to, blinded by, and intoxicated with sensual pleasures.

Then several bhikkhus, after dressing in the morning and taking their alms bowls and outer robes, entered Sāvatthi for alms. Then, having wandered for alms in Sāvatthi, those bhikkhus, after their meal and having returned from their alms round, approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, they paid homage to him and sat down to one side. As they were seated thus, they said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, by and large, the people of Sāvatthi are excessively clinging to sensual pleasures—infatuated by, desirous for, bound by, fixated with, attached to, blinded by, and intoxicated with sensual pleasures.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Clinging to sensual pleasures, entangled in the bonds of sensual desire,
they do not see the |fault::error, mistake, wrong [vajja]| in fetters;
|Bound fast by bonds and fetters::attached by ties and chains [saṃyojanasaṅgasatta]|, certainly,
they cannot cross the flood so great and vast.”
