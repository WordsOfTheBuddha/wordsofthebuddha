Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time, the Blessed One was instructing, inciting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk related to Nibbāna. The bhikkhus were attentive, having applied themselves entirely, mentally gathered, with ears ready, listening to the Dhamma.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Bhikkhus, there exists a |base::āyatanaṁ|, where there is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor wind; neither the |base of boundless space::field of boundless expanse, sometimes translated as dimension of infinite space [ākāsānañcāyatana]|, nor the |base of boundless consciousness::field of limitless awareness [viññāṇañcāyatana]|, nor the |base of nothingness::field of awareness centered on the absence of any distinct “something" to grasp or hold onto [ākiñcaññāyatana]|, nor the base of neither perception nor non-perception; neither this world, nor the other world, nor both, nor sun nor moon. Here, bhikkhus, I say there is no coming, no going, no staying, no passing away, no arising. It is without support, without occurrence, and without object. This, bhikkhus, is the ending of suffering.”
