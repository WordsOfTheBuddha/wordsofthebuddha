Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time, the Blessed One was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a discourse on the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| related to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|. And those bhikkhus, having made it their goal, applying their minds and having collected their whole mind, were listening to the Dhamma with attentive ears.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Bhikkhus, there exists a |base::āyatanaṁ|, where there is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor wind; neither the |base of boundless space::field of boundless expanse, sometimes translated as dimension of infinite space [ākāsānañcāyatana]|, nor the |base of boundless consciousness::field of limitless awareness [viññāṇañcāyatana]|, nor the |base of nothingness::field of awareness centered on the absence of any distinct “something" to grasp or hold onto [ākiñcaññāyatana]|, nor the |base of neither perception nor non-perception::field of awareness of subtle mental activity that do not arise to the level of forming a perception [nevasaññānāsaññāyatana]|; neither this world, nor the other world, nor both, nor sun nor moon. Here, bhikkhus, I say there is no coming, no going, no staying, no passing away, no rebirth. It is without support, without occurrence, and without object. This, bhikkhus, is the end of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”
