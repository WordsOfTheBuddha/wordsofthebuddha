Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now at that time, the venerable Saṅgāmaji had arrived at Sāvatthi to see the Blessed One. The venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife heard: “Sir |Saṅgāmaji::name of a monk; lit. winner in war; victor in battle [saṅgāmaji]| has arrived at Sāvatthi, it seems.” Taking the young boy, she came to Jeta’s grove.

Now at that time, the venerable Saṅgāmaji was seated at the foot of a certain tree for the day’s abiding. Then the venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife approached the venerable Saṅgāmaji; having approached, she said this to the venerable Saṅgāmaji: “I am with a young son, ascetic. Support me.” When this was said, the venerable Saṅgāmaji remained silent.

For a second time, the venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife said to the venerable Saṅgāmaji: “I am having a young son, ascetic. Support me.” For a second time, the venerable Saṅgāmaji remained silent.

For a third time, the venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife said to the venerable Saṅgāmaji: “I am having a young son, ascetic. Support me.” For a third time, the venerable Saṅgāmaji remained silent.

Then the venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife put that young boy down in front of the venerable Saṅgāmaji and left, saying: “This is your son, ascetic. Support him.”

But the venerable Saṅgāmaji neither looked at that young boy nor spoke to him. Then the venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife, having gone not far, looking back, saw the venerable Saṅgāmaji neither looking at nor speaking to that young boy. Having seen this, it occurred to her: “This ascetic has no need even for a son.” Then, having returned, taking the young boy, she left. The Blessed One, with the |divine eye::the faculty of clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the ordinary human range [dibbacakkhu]|, purified and surpassing human vision, saw this behavior of the venerable Saṅgāmaji’s former wife.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“He |does not take delight::is not pleased, does not find pleasure [nābhinandati]| in her coming,
nor |sorrows::grieves [socati]| at her leaving;
Victorious in battle, freed from all bonds—
him, I call a true sage.”
