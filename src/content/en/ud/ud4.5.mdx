Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Kosambi::name of a town; capital city of the Vatsas [kosambī]| in Ghosita's park. Now at that time, the Blessed One was living |hemmed in::crowded, surrounded [ākiṇṇa]| by bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay disciples, female lay disciples, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, and disciples of sectarians. Being hemmed in, he dwelt in discomfort and not at ease. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “Now at present, I am living hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay disciples, female lay disciples, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, and disciples of sectarians. Being hemmed in, I dwell in discomfort and not at ease. Suppose I were to dwell alone, withdrawn from the crowd.”

Then the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, taking his alms bowl and outer robe, entered Kosambi for alms. Having wandered through Kosambi for alms and after the meal, having returned from the alms round, he put his lodging in order. Then, taking his alms bowl and outer robe, without informing his attendant and without taking leave of the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, he set out on a walking tour toward |Pālileyyaka::name of a town near Kosambi [pālileyyaka]|, alone and without a companion. Wandering by stages, he arrived at Pālileyyaka. There, at Pālileyyaka, the Blessed One dwelt in the |Rakkhita Forest Grove::name of forest; lit. protected forest grove [rakkhitavanasaṇḍa]| at the foot of an auspicious |sal tree::a tall, majestic hardwood tree known for its strength, durability, and grandeur, Shorea robusta [sāla]|.

Now a certain bull elephant was also living hemmed in by male elephants, female elephants, young elephant, and baby elephants. He ate grass with the tips cut off, while they ate what he had broken down from the branches. He drank muddied water. And when he had plunged into the water and come out, female elephants went bumping against his body. Being hemmed in, he dwelt in discomfort and not at ease. Then it occurred to that bull elephant: 'Now at present, I am living hemmed in by male elephants, female elephants, young elephants, and baby elephants. I eat grass with the tips cut off, while they eat what I have broken down from the branches. I drink muddied water. And when I have plunged into the water and come out, female elephants go bumping against my body. Being hemmed in, I dwell in discomfort and not at ease. Suppose I were to dwell alone, withdrawn from the herd.”

Then that bull elephant, having departed from the herd, went to Pālileyyaka, to the Rakkhita Forest Grove, to the foot of the auspicious sal tree where the Blessed One was. There, that bull elephant cleared the grass from the spot where the Blessed One was dwelling, and with his trunk, he provided drinking water and washing water for the Blessed One.

Then, while the Blessed One was in seclusion and withdrawn, this train of thought arose in his mind: “Formerly, I lived hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay disciples, female lay disciples, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, and disciples of sectarians. Being hemmed in, I dwelt in discomfort and not at ease. But now I am living not hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male lay disciples, female lay disciples, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, and disciples of sectarians. Being not hemmed in, I dwell in comfort and at ease.”

Then to that bull elephant also, this train of thought arose in his mind: “Formerly, I lived hemmed in by male elephants, female elephants, young elephants, and baby elephants. I ate grass with the tips cut off, while they ate what I had broken down from the branches. I drank muddied water. And when I had plunged into the water and come out, female elephants went bumping against my body. Being hemmed in, I dwelt in discomfort and not at ease. But now I am living not hemmed in by male elephants, female elephants, young elephants, and baby elephants. I eat grass with the tips not cut off, and they do not eat what I have broken down from the branches. I drink unmuddied water. And when I have plunged into the water and come out, female elephants do not go bumping against my body. Being not hemmed in, I dwell in comfort and at ease.”

Then the Blessed One, understanding his own seclusion and knowing with his own mind the train of thought of that bull elephant, at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“This [thought] of the |Nāga::noble person, epithet of an Arahant [nāga]| accords with the Nāga—
the elephant with tusks like chariot-pole;
Their minds are in accord,
for the mind delights in solitude.”
