Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now at that time, a group of bhikkhus, having returned from their alms round after the meal, were seated and assembled together in the round pavilion. Then this discussion arose among them: “Friends, who here knows a craft? Who has learned what skill? Which craft is the best among all branches of knowledge?”

Then some said: “The craft of elephant-training is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of horsemanship is the best of all skills.” Some Said: “The craft of charioteering is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of archery is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of swordsmanship is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of hand-calculation is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of uninterrupted enumeration is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of arithmetic is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of calligraphy is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of composing poetry is the best of all skills.” Some said: “The craft of natural philosophy is the best of all skills.” Some said: “Skill in polity is the best of all skills.” And this discussion among the bhikkhus was left unfinished.

For the Blessed One, having emerged from |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]| in the late afternoon, approached the assembly hall, and sat down on the prepared seat. Once he was seated, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, for what topic of conversation are you now seated together here? And what was the discussion among you that was left unfinished?”

“Here, venerable sir, after our meal, when we had returned from the alms round and were seated and assembled together in the round pavilion, this discussion arose among us: ‘Friends, who knows a craft? Who has learned what skill? Which craft is the foremost among all branches of knowledge?’

Thereupon, some said, ‘The craft of elephant-training is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of horsemanship is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of charioteering is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of archery is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of swordsmanship is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of hand-calculation is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of uninterrupted enumeration is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of arithmetic is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of calligraphy is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of composing poetry is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘The craft of natural philosophy is the best of all skills.’ Some said, ‘Skill in polity is the best of all skills.’ And this was the discussion, venerable sir, that was left unfinished when the Blessed One arrived.”

“It is not proper for you, bhikkhus, sons of good families who have gone forth out of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]| from the household life into homelessness, to engage in such a discussion. When you are gathered together, bhikkhus, two things are proper—either a |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| discussion or noble silence.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“For one without a craft, light, desiring what is good,
|restrained in senses::mentally controlled [yatindriya]|, released in every way;
Wandering homeless, |free from ‘mine’::not holding on to anything as I, me, or mine [amama]|, |fulfilled::free from hope, desire-less [nirāsa]|,
having cast off |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|—that bhikkhu walks alone.”
