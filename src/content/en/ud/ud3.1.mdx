Thus have I heard—At At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. Now, at that time, a certain bhikkhu was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]| and |aligning::guiding, directing, setting [paṇidhāya]| his body in an |upright::straight, erect [uju]| posture. Enduring sharp, severe, and painful |bodily sensations::pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral felt experience, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedana]| that were caused by the results of past actions, he remained |mindful::mindfulness of body in and of itself, of felt experience in and of itself, of mind in and of itself, of mental qualities in and of itself [sati]| and |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]|, |untroubled::not annoyed, not upset [avihaññamāna]| by the experience.

The Blessed One saw that bhikkhu sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, and enduring sharp, severe, and painful bodily sensations caused by the results of past actions, while remaining mindful and fully aware, untroubled by the experience.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"For the bhikkhu who has |abandoned all actions::given up all intentional activities [sabbakammajaha]|,
shaking off the dust of past deeds;
|Steady::stable [ṭhita]| and |free from 'mine'::not holding on to anything as I, me, or mine [amama]|, such a one,
has no need |to complain::to tell, to say [lapetave]| to anyone."
