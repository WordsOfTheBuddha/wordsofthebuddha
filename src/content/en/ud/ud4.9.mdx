Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Rājagaha::name of a city; capital of Magadha; lit. king's house [rājagaha]|, in the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground. Then, while the venerable Upasena, Vaṅganta's son, was alone in |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, the following |reflection::contemplation, train of thought [parivitakka]| arose in his mind: “It is a blessing for me, it is most fortunate for me, for my teacher is the Blessed One, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One. I have gone forth from household life into homelessness in the well explained |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| and |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|. My spiritual companions are |virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]| and |endowed with wholesome qualities::one who has had a long association of wholesome mental qualities - of diligence, aroused energy, having few wishes, rational application of mind, having situational awareness, having good friends, pursuing good habits [kalyāṇadhamma]|. In moral conduct, I am fully accomplished. I am |well composed::completely calm, totally settled, attentive, completely collected [susamāhita]|, |with a unified mind::with a one-pointed mind; with an integrated, well-composed, concentrated mind [ekaggacitta]|. I am a worthy one |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|. I possess great psychic power and might. Blessed has been my life, and blessed will be my death.”

Then the Blessed One, perceiving venerable Upasena, Vaṅganta's son's reflection |with mind::with intention [cetasā]|, at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“That way of life which is without affliction,
culminating in a death which is free from |sorrow::grief [socati]|;
That |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]| one, who has seen the way [to Nibbāna],
does not grieve even in the midst of sorrow.

Who has cut the |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| for |existence::being, becoming; continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|,
for that bhikkhu |with a calm mind::with a peaceful heart [santacitta]|;
Birth and wandering on has ended,
for him, there is no |renewed existence::renewal of being, reappearance, rebirth, future life [punabbhava]|.”
