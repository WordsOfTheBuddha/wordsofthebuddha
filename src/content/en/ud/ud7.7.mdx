Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time, the Blessed One was seated, reflecting on his own |giving up of the proliferation of conceptual perceptions::abandoning the proliferation of opinions, concepts and constructs [papañcasaññāsaṅkhāpahāna]|.

Then, the Blessed One, having understood his own giving up of the proliferation of conceptual perceptions, at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“For whom support for conceptual proliferation does not exist,
who has gone beyond tethers and barriers;
The sage who lives without |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|,
is not despised by the world with its gods.”
