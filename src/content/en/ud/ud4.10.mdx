Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now, at that time, the venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]|, aligning his body upright, |reviewing::reviewing on, looking at [paccavekkhamāna]| his own |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Sāriputta sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, reviewing his own tranquility.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“For the bhikkhu |at peace with a calm mind::tranquil with a peaceful heart [upasantasantacitta]|,
|who has cut the conduit to existence::(comm) who has severed craving [netticchinna]|;
Having totally exhausted birth and wandering on,
he is freed from |Māra's bond::shackles of death [mārabandhana]|.”
