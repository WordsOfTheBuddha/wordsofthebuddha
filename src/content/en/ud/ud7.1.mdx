Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, the venerable Sāriputta was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the venerable |Lakuṇḍaka Bhaddiya::name of an Arahant bhikkhu; lit. lucky dwarf [lakuṇḍakabhaddiya]| in various ways with a talk on the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|.

Then, as the venerable Lakuṇḍaka Bhaddiya was being instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened in various ways by the venerable Sāriputta with a talk on the Dhamma, his mind was liberated from the |taints::defilements, pollutants [āsava]| through |not grasping::not holding (onto), detaching (from), not taking possession (of); lit. not taking near [anupāda]|.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Lakuṇḍaka Bhaddiya being instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened in various ways by the venerable Sāriputta with a talk on the Dhamma, and [saw] his mind liberated from the taints through not grasping.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Above, below, released in every way,
not regarding [anything] as ‘I am this;’
Thus liberated, he has crossed over the flood,
never crossed before, for the ending of |renewed existence::renewal of being, reappearance, rebirth, future life [punabbhava]|.”
