Thus have I heard — Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. At that time, the Blessed One was addressing the bhikkhus on a topic related to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|, instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening them. The bhikkhus listened attentively, earnestly, and with a concentrated mind, absorbing the Dhamma with keen ears.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"Bhikkhus, there is the |unborn::unproduced [ajāta]|, |unbecome::without becoming [abhūta]|, |unmade::not created [akata]|, |unconditioned::not created, unconstructed, unformed, epithet of Nibbāna [asaṅkhata]|. If there were not the unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, there would be no discernment of escape from the born, become, made, conditioned. But since there is the unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, therefore the |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| from the born, become, made, conditioned is |discerned::clearly known, become evident [paññāyati]|."
