Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, the Blessed One was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a talk on the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| related to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|. And those bhikkhus, having made it their goal, applying their minds and having collected their whole mind, were listening to the Dhamma with attentive ears.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Bhikkhus, there is the |unborn::unproduced [ajāta]|, |unbecome::without becoming [abhūta]|, |unmade::not created [akata]|, |unconditioned::not created, unconstructed, unformed, epithet of Nibbāna [asaṅkhata]|. If there were not the unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, there would be no discernment of escape from the born, become, made, conditioned. But since there is the unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, therefore the |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| from the born, become, made, conditioned is |discerned::clearly known, become evident [paññāyati]|.”
