Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Rājagaha::name of a city; capital of Magadha; lit. king's house [rājagaha]|, in the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground. Now, at that time, the venerable |Sāriputta::foremost disciple of the Buddha in great wisdom [sāriputta]| and the venerable |Mahāmoggallāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in psychic power; lit. Moggallāna the great [mahāmoggallāna]| were staying at the Pigeon’s Cave. Now at that time venerable Sāriputta was sitting in the open air on a moonlit night, his head freshly shaven, having entered a certain state of |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|.

At that time, two |native spirits::spirits that may be protective or malevolent, daemons, or supernatural beings [yakkhā]| who were companions were traveling from the north to the south on some business. Those spirits saw the venerable Sāriputta sitting in the open air on the moonlit night, his hair newly shaven. Upon seeing him, one spirit said to the second spirit: “It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow to this ascetic’s head.” When this was said, the other spirit said to him: “Enough, friend! Do not strike the ascetic. That ascetic, friend, is |lofty::eminent, noble [uḷāra]|, |of great psychic power::of great spiritual power [mahiddhika]| and great might.”

For a second time, that spirit said to the second spirit: “It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow to this ascetic’s head.” When this was said, the other spirit said to him: “Enough, friend! Do not strike the ascetic. That ascetic, friend, is lofty, of great psychic power and great might.”

For a third time, that spirit said to the second spirit: “It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow to this ascetic’s head.” When this was said, the other spirit said to him: “Enough, friend! Do not strike the ascetic. That ascetic, friend, is lofty, of great psychic power and great might.”

Then, that spirit, disregarding the other spirit, gave the venerable Sāriputta a blow to the head. It was such a great blow that it might have felled an elephant seven or seven-and-a-half cubits tall, or split a great mountain peak. Then that spirit, crying out, “I am burning! I am burning!” right there and then fell into the great hell.

The venerable Mahāmoggallāna—with the |divine eye::the faculty of clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the ordinary human range [dibbacakkhu]|, purified and surpassing human vision—saw the spirit giving the venerable Sāriputta a blow to the head. Seeing this, he approached the venerable Sāriputta. Having drawn near, he said to the venerable Sāriputta: “I hope you are well, friend; I hope you are managing; I hope you are not feeling any pain.” “I am well, friend Moggallāna, I am managing, friend Moggallāna. But I have a little pain in my head.”

“It is wonderful, friend Sāriputta! It is marvelous, friend Sāriputta! How great is the venerable Sāriputta’s psychic power and might! Just now, friend Sāriputta, a certain native spirit gave you a blow to the head. It was such a great blow that it might have felled an elephant seven or seven-and-a-half cubits tall, or split a great mountain peak. Yet the venerable Sāriputta says: ‘I am well, friend Moggallāna, I am managing, friend Moggallāna. But I have a little pain in my head.’”

“It is wonderful, friend Moggallāna! It is marvelous, friend Moggallāna! How great is the venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s psychic power and might, that he could even see a spirit! Whereas I can't even see a dirt goblin right now!”

The Blessed One, with the |divine ear element::clairaudience, the divine auditory faculty [dibba + sotadhātu]|, purified and surpassing the human range, heard this conversation between these two great beings.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Whose mind is like a rock,
steady, and not wavering;
Unmoved by things that |spark desire::are enticing, are tantalizing [rajanīya]|,
not |shaken::agitated, disturbed [kuppati]| by things that provoke anger;
For one whose mind is |cultivated::developed [bhāvita]| in this way,
from where can |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| come?”
