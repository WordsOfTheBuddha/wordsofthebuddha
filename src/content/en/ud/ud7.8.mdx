Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now, at that time, the venerable |Mahākaccāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in explaining a brief instruction in detail; lit. great descendant of Kati [mahākaccāna]| was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]|, aligning his body upright, and with |mindfulness immersed in the body::mindfulness related to the body, focused within [kāyagata + sati]|, |well-established::fully engaged [sūpaṭṭhita]| internally.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Mahākaccāna sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, and with mindfulness immersed in the body, well-established internally.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“For whom mindfulness is always present,
continually established in the body;
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine,
it will not be, and it will not be mine;’ <sup>[1]</sup>
Dwelling successively on that,
he would, in time, cross over |attachment::ensnarement, entanglement [visattika]|.”
