Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now, at that time, the Blessed One was sitting, |reviewing::reviewing on, looking at [paccavekkhamāna]| the multitude of |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| he had abandoned, and the multitude of |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| mental qualities that he had |developed to completion::cultivated to maturity [bhāvanāpāripūri]|.

Then the Blessed One, having perceived that multitude of harmful and unwholesome qualities had been abandoned by him, and that multitude of wholesome qualities had been developed to completion, at that time uttered this inspired utterance:

“There was in the past, then there was not,
there was not in the past, then there was;
It neither was, nor will it be,
nor does it exist |now::at present [cetarahi]|.”^[1]^
