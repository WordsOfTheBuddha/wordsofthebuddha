Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was on a walking tour, wandering in the |Malla::name of the people of Malla; Mallans; lit. wrestlers [malla]| country with a large |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at |Pāvā::name of a city of the Mallas [pāvā]|. There, the Blessed One stayed at Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda the smith.

Cunda the smith heard: “The Blessed One, it seems, while wandering on a walking tour among the Mallas with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, has arrived at Pāvā and is staying at Pāvā in my mango grove.” Then Cunda the smith approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While Cunda the smith was seated to one side, the Blessed One gave him a talk on the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening him. Then Cunda the smith, having been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One’s talk on the Dhamma, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented in silence.

Then Cunda the smith, having received the Blessed One’s consent, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed. Then, after the passage of that night, Cunda the smith had various kinds of excellent food prepared in his own residence, along with a considerable amount of |sūkaramaddava::Literally meaning "soft pig," this term is traditionally interpreted as tender pork, though some scholars suggest it refers to truffles or mushrooms found by pigs. It signifies the specific dish served by Cunda the smith at the Buddha's final meal, which the Buddha noted only a Tathāgata could digest. [sūkaramaddava]|, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready.”

Then the Blessed One, having dressed early in the morning, taking his alms bowl and outer robe, went to the residence of Cunda the smith together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat. Sitting there, the Blessed One addressed Cunda the smith: “Serve me, Cunda, with the sūkaramaddava that has been prepared; but serve the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with the other various kinds of excellent food that has been prepared.” “Yes, venerable sir,” Cunda the smith replied to the Blessed One, and he served the Blessed One with the sūkaramaddava that had been prepared, and he served the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with the other various kinds of excellent food that had been prepared.

Then the Blessed One addressed Cunda the smith: “Cunda, bury whatever sūkaramaddava is left over in a pit. For I do not see anyone in the world with its deities, Māras, and Brahmās, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, who could digest it if they ate it, except for the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|.” “Yes, venerable sir,” Cunda the smith replied to the Blessed One. Having buried the leftover sūkaramaddava in a pit, he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Cunda the smith with a talk on the Dhamma, then rose from his seat and departed.

Then, after the Blessed One had eaten the meal of Cunda the smith, a severe illness arose in him—bloody dysentery—and intense life-threatening pains assailed him. Yet the Blessed One, |mindful::mindfulness of body in and of itself, of felt experience in and of itself, of mind in and of itself, of mental qualities in and of themselves [sati]| and |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]|, endured them |untroubled::not annoyed, not upset [avihaññamāna]|.

Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to |Kusinārā::name of a Mallan town; small town where the Buddha passed away [kusinārā]|.” “Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One.

Having eaten the meal of Cunda the smith,
so I have heard;
The |steadfast one::intelligent one, stable, wise [dhīra]| was touched by an illness,
severe and life-threatening.

After eating the sūkaramaddava,
a serious illness arose in the Teacher;
|While purging::vomiting [viriccamāna]|, the Blessed One said:
“I will go to the city of Kusinārā.”

Then, the Blessed One stepped off the road and approached the foot of a certain tree. Having approached, he addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Please, Ānanda, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am exhausted, Ānanda, and I will sit down.” “Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One, and he folded the outer robe in four and spread it out. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. Sitting there, the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty, Ānanda, and I will drink.”

When this was said, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Just now, venerable sir, five hundred carts have passed through. The shallow water has been churned up by their wheels, and it flows stirred up and murky. The Kukudhā river, venerable sir, is not far away, with pure, sweet, cool, and clear water, with beautiful banks, and delightful. There the Blessed One can drink water and cool his limbs.”

A second time and a third time the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty, Ānanda, and I will drink.” “Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. Taking his bowl, he went to the stream. Then, that stream—which had been churned up by the wheels and was flowing shallow, stirred up, and murky—flowed clear, bright, and undisturbed as the venerable Ānanda approached.

Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda: “It is truly wonderful, it is truly marvelous! The great supernormal power and great might of the Tathāgata! For this stream, which was flowing shallow, stirred up, and murky, having been churned up by the wheels, flowed clear, bright, and undisturbed as I approached.” Taking water in his bowl, he approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he said to the Blessed One: “It is wonderful, venerable sir! It is marvelous, venerable sir, the great supernormal power and great might of the Tathāgata! For this stream, venerable sir, which was flowing shallow, stirred up, and murky, having been churned up by the wheels, flowed clear, bright, and undisturbed as I approached. Let the Blessed One drink the water! Let the Accomplished One drink the water!”

Then the Blessed One drank the water. Then the Blessed One, together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, went to the Kukudhā river. Having arrived, he plunged into the Kukudhā river, bathed, drank, and came back out, and then went to the mango grove. Having arrived, he addressed the venerable Cundaka: “Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am exhausted, Cundaka, and I will lie down.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Cundaka replied to the Blessed One, and he folded the outer robe in four and spread it out. Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture, placing one leg overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, having attended to the idea of rising up. And the venerable Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Blessed One.

The Awakened One, having gone to the river Kukudhā,
with water pure, sweet, and clear;
The Teacher plunged in, though utterly exhausted,
the Tathāgata, without compare in the world.

Having bathed and having drunk, the Teacher came out,
surrounded amidst the group of bhikkhus;
The Blessed One, the Teacher in this Dhamma,
the great sage went to the mango grove;
He addressed the bhikkhu named Cundaka:
“Spread out the four-fold robe for me to lie on.”

Cundaka, exhorted by the |well-trained one::one who is awakened; lit. developed self [bhāvitatta]|,
spread out the four-fold robe at once;
The Teacher lay down, appearing utterly exhausted,
and Cundaka too sat right there in front.

Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ānanda: “It may happen, Ānanda, that someone might cause |remorse::regret; lit. remembering back negatively [vippaṭisāra]| to arise in Cunda the smith, saying: ‘It is a loss for you, friend Cunda, it is unfortunate for you, that the Tathāgata attained |final Nibbāna::complete cooling, full quenching, total emancipation, dying one’s final death [parinibbuta]| after eating his last alms food from you.’ Ānanda, any remorse in Cunda the smith should be dispelled in this way—

‘It is a gain for you, friend Cunda, it is fortunate for you, that the Tathāgata attained final Nibbāna after eating his last alms food from you. I heard this, friend Cunda, in the Blessed One’s own presence, received it in his own presence: “These two alms foods have equal fruit and equal result, and are of much greater fruit and benefit than any other alms foods. Which two? The alms food after eating which the Tathāgata awakens to the unsurpassed |perfect awakening::full enlightenment [sammāsambodhi]|; and the alms food after eating which he attains final Nibbāna in the Nibbāna element |with no residual clinging::with no grasping to existence, with no fuel remaining [anupādisesa]|. These two alms foods have equal fruit and equal result, and are of much greater fruit and benefit than any other alms foods.”’

‘The venerable Cunda the smith has accumulated [good] |kamma::action, deed, doing, volitional act [kamma]| that leads to long life. The venerable Cunda the smith has accumulated [good] kamma that leads to |beauty::good looks [vaṇṇa]|. The venerable Cunda the smith has accumulated [good] kamma that leads to happiness. The venerable Cunda the smith has accumulated [good] kamma that leads to heaven. The venerable Cunda the smith has accumulated [good] kamma that leads to |fame::glory, prestige [yasa]|. The venerable Cunda the smith has accumulated [good] kamma that leads to rulership.’ Ānanda, any remorse in Cunda the smith should be dispelled in this way.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“|Merit::good deed, spiritual wealth [puñña]| grows for one who gives,
hatred is not piled up for one who is with |restraint::self-control [saṁyama]|;
The skillful person abandons |harmful::injurious, bad, or evil. Encompasses the deceptively alluring that is ultimately detrimental or ruinous [pāpaka]| [actions],
with the wearing away of passion, hatred, and delusion, they are quenched.”
