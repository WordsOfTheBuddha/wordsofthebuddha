Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now, at that time, the venerable |Aññāsi Koṇḍañña::first person to realize the Buddha’s teaching; lit. Koṇḍañña understood [aññāsikoṇḍañña]| was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]|, aligning his body upright, |reviewing::reviewing on, looking at [paccavekkhamāna]| his liberation through the extinction of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|.

Then the Blessed One saw the venerable Aññāsi Koṇḍañña sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, reviewing his liberation through the extinction of craving.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“He whose root is not in the earth,
who has no leaves — whence could there be a vine?
That |steadfast one::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]|, released from all |chains::attachment, bondage, connection, fetter [bandhana]|,
who is worthy to criticize him?
Even the gods praise him,
and by |Brahma::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahma]| too, he is praised.”
