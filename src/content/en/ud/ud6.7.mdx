Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now, at that time, the venerable Subhūti was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]|, aligning his body upright, having entered |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| |free of thinking::without thought, a second jhāna or above [avitakka]|.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Subhūti sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, and abiding in collectedness free of thinking.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“For one whose thoughts are completely |dispelled::dispersed [vidhūpita]|,
and whose internal doubts are fully resolved without remainder;
Such a one, having gone beyond |sticking point::bond, snare, clinging, attachment, holding on [saṅga]|, |percipient of the formless::having perception beyond that extends beyond material [arūpasaññī]|,
has overcome the four bonds [1] and will never |come to::become, return [meti]|.”
