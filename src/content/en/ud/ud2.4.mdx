Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, the Blessed One was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and received robes, alms food, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick. The bhikkhu |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and received robes, alms food, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick. However, the wanderers of other sects were not honored, not respected, not revered, not venerated, and did not receive robes, alms food, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick. At that time, the wanderers of other sects, unable to tolerate the honor given to the Blessed One and the bhikkhu Saṅgha, when they saw the bhikkhus in the village or the forest, would insult, abuse, provoke and harass them with harsh words.

Then several bhikkhus approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, they paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said: “At present, Bhante, the Blessed One is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and receives robes, alms food, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick. The bhikkhu Saṅgha is also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and receives robes, alms food, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick. However, the wanderers of other sects are not honored, not respected, not revered, not venerated, and do not receive robes, alms food, lodging, and medicinal requisites for the sick. These wanderers of other sects, unable to tolerate the honor given to the Blessed One and the bhikkhu Saṅgha, when they see the bhikkhus in the village or the forest, insult, abuse, provoke and harass them with harsh words.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

In the village and in the forest, touched by ease and discomfort,
One should not blame oneself nor others;
Contacts harms one who is dependent on attachments,
But how can contacts harm one who is without attachments?
