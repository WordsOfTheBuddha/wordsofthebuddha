Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time, a certain lay disciple from |Icchānaṅgala::name of a Brahman village in Kosala [icchānaṅgala]| had arrived in Sāvatthi for some business. Having completed that business in Sāvatthi, he approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was seated to one side, the Blessed One said to him: “After a long time, lay disciple, you have made this effort, that is, for coming here.”

“For a long time, venerable sir, I wished to come and see the Blessed One, but I have been occupied with various duties and obligations. Thus, I was unable to come to see the Blessed One.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Indeed, there is not even the slightest suffering,
for |one who has comprehended the nature of reality::one who has understood the Dhamma, the truth, an Arahant, awakened being [saṅkhātadhamma]|, who is |very learned::well educated, knowledgeable [bahussutā]|;
But see how the |one with possessions::who has baggage, who has worldly attachment [sakiñcana]| |suffers hardship::is upset, is irritated, is tormented [vihaññamāna]|,
his mind |entangled with::bound to, tied up with [paṭibandha]| others.”
