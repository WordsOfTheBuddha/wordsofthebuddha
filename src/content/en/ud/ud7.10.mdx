Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi, in Ghosita’s park. Now at that time, while King Udena had gone to the pleasure park, the king’s palace was burnt down, and five hundred women headed by |Sāmāvatī::foremost female lay disciple of the Buddha among those living in a state of friendliness; lit. of a dark complexion [sāmāvatī]| died.

Then several bhikkhus robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Kosambi for alms. After wandering for alms in Kosambi and returning from their alms round after the meal, they went to the Blessed One. They bowed to the Blessed One and sat to one side. Seated to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: “Here, sir, while King Udena had gone to the pleasure park, the king’s palace was burnt down, and five hundred women headed by Sāmāvatī died. What is the destination, sir, what is the future rebirth of those female lay disciples?”

“Among those female lay disciples, bhikkhus, there are |stream-enterers::A stream-enterer is an individual who has attained the first stage of awakening, having completely abandoned the three fetters: 1) personal existence view - identity view, belief in a self, 2) doubt or perplexity regarding suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering, and 3) adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation [sotāpannā]|, |once-returners::the second stage of awakening where one has completely exhausted the fetters of 1] personal existence, 2] doubt regarding suffering, the arising of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path leading to the end of suffering, and 3] adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation; as well as made significant progress in overcoming the fetters of 4] sensual desire and 5] ill will. [sakadāgāmī]|, and |non-returners::third stage of awakening where the lower five fetters of 1] personal existence, i.e. view that one is an embodied being, 2] doubt regarding suffering, the arising of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path leading to the end of suffering, 3] adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation, 4] sensual desire and 5] ill will are completely overcome [anāgāmī]|. None of those female lay disciples, bhikkhus, died in vain.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“The world, in bondage to |delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|,
appears as if it were |beautiful::of good appearance; lit. suitable form [bhabbarūpa]|;
The |immature::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]|, tied to |acquisitions::attachment, taking as mine, appropriation, sense of ownership, identification [upadhi]| [and identity],
is surrounded by |darkness::ignorance, gloom, murkiness [tamas]|;
It seems as if existing forever,
but for one who sees, there is nothing.”
