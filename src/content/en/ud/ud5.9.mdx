Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large |Saṅgha::the community of followers of the Buddha, whether lay or monastic, who have attained to one of the four stages of awakening [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. Now, at that time, several |young brāhmaṇas::[typically of a brāhmaṇa] youngsters, young boys [māṇavakā]| were passing by not far from the Blessed One in a |mocking manner::appearing to be jeering, laughing at, making fun of [sadhāyamānarūpa]|. The Blessed One saw the group of young brāhmaṇas passing by at a distance, appearing to be mocking.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"While being muddle-minded, they talk as if wise,
speaking merely in the realm of words;
Stretching their mouths as much as they want,
are led on by what they don't understand."
