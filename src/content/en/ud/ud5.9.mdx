Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns following the Buddha. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teaching [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. Now, at that time, several |young brāhmaṇas::[typically of a brāhmaṇa] youngsters, young boys [māṇavakā]| were passing by not far from the Blessed One in a |mocking manner::appearing to be jeering, laughing at, making fun of [sadhāyamānarūpa]|. The Blessed One saw the group of young brāhmaṇas passing by at a distance, appearing to be mocking.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"While being muddle-minded, they talk as if wise,
speaking merely in the realm of words;
Stretching their mouths as much as they want,
are led on by what they don't understand."
