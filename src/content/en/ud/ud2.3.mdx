Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. During that time, several young boys between Sāvatthi and Jeta’s Grove were hitting a snake with sticks. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his alms bowl and outer robe, and entered Sāvatthi for alms. The Blessed One saw those boys between Sāvatthi and the Jeta’s Grove hitting the snakes with sticks.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“He who, while seeking his own happiness,
Harms with a stick beings who desire happiness,
Will not find happiness after passing away.

He who, while seeking his own happiness,
Does not harm with a stick beings who desire happiness,
Will find happiness after passing away.”
