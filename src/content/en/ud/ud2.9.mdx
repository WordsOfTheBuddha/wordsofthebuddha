Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in the Eastern Park, at Migāramātā's mansion. At that time, |Visākhā, also known as Migāramātā::one of the foremost laywomen and devoted supporters of the Buddha, also known as Migāramātā (Migāra’s mother) from a significant event in her life when she skillfully guided her father-in-law, Migāra, towards the Dhamma|, had some matter concerning King Pasenadi of Kosala. But King Pasenadi of Kosala did not settle it in line with her expectation.

Then, Visākhā, Migāramātā, approached the Blessed One during the day; having drawn near, she paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As she was seated to one side, the Blessed One addressed her: “Well, Visākhā, where have you come from during the day?” “Venerable sir, I had some matter concerning King Pasenadi of Kosala. But King Pasenadi of Kosala did not settle it in line with my expectation.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“All under another’s control brings |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,
all under one’s own control brings |ease::contentment, pleasing, bliss [sukha]|;
What is shared is troublesome [for all involved],
|bonds::yoke, attachment, which binds one to the cyclical existence [yoga]| are hard to overcome.”
