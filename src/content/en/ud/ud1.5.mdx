Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now at that time, the Venerable |Sāriputta::foremost disciple of the Buddha in great wisdom [sāriputta]|, Venerable |Mahāmoggallāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in psychic power; lit. Moggallāna the great [mahāmoggallāna]|, Venerable |Mahākassapa::foremost disciple of the Buddha in preaching ascetic practices; lit. Kassapa the great [mahākassapa]|, Venerable |Mahākaccāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in explaining a brief instruction in detail; lit. great descendant of Kati [mahākaccāna]|, Venerable |Mahākoṭṭhika::Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika is regarded as the foremost disciple of the Buddha in analytical understanding [mahākoṭṭhika]|, Venerable |Mahākappina::foremost disciple of the Buddha in instructing the monks; lit. great Kappina [mahākappina]|, Venerable Mahācunda, Venerable |Anuruddha::foremost disciple of the Buddha in divine eye; also a cousin of the Buddha [anuruddha]|, Venerable |Revata::Venerable Revata is regarded as the foremost disciple of the Buddha in forest dwelling [revata]|, and Venerable Nanda approached the Blessed One.

The Blessed One saw those venerable ones approaching from afar. Having seen them, he addressed the bhikkhus: “These, bhikkhus, are |Brāhmaṇs::sages, Brāhmaṇ is a title used by the Buddha for an Arahant, an awakened being [brāhmaṇā]| coming; these, bhikkhus, are Brāhmaṇs coming.” When this was said, a certain bhikkhu of Brāhmaṇ birth said to the Blessed One: “How, venerable sir, is one a Brāhmaṇ? What are the qualities of a Brāhmaṇ?”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Having cast off |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| qualities,
who wanders always |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]|;
The Awakened Ones whose fetters are worn away,
they, indeed, are true Brāhmaṇs in the world.”
