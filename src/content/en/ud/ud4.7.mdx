Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now, at that time, the venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]|, aligning his body upright, |with few desires::having few needs, who is modest [appiccha]|, |content::satisfied, pleased [santuṭṭha]|, |secluded::detached, solitary [pavivitta]|, |disentangled::not mixed-up with, aloof from [asaṃsaṭṭha]|, |with energy aroused::with initiative [āraddhavīriya]|, |engaged in meditation::cultivating the higher mind [adhicittamanuyutta]|.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Sāriputta sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, with few desires, content, secluded, disentangled, with energy aroused, engaged in meditation.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“For one with heightened mental faculties, who is not negligent,
the sage training in the path of wisdom;
|Sorrows::griefs, sadness [sokā]| do not arise for such a steadfast one,
for the |composed::calmed, tranquil [upasanta]|, ever |mindful::attentive, fully present [satīmant]| one.”
