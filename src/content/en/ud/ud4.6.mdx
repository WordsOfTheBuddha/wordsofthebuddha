Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now, at that time, the venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]|, aligning his body upright, a forest dweller, an alms gatherer, a wearer of rag robes, one with only three robes, |with few desires::having few needs, who is modest [appiccha]|, |content::satisfied, pleased [santuṭṭha]|, |secluded::detached, solitary [pavivitta]|, |disentangled::not mixed-up with, aloof from [asaṃsaṭṭha]|, |with energy aroused::with initiative [āraddhavīriya]|, an advocate of ascetic practices, |engaged in meditation::cultivating the higher mind [adhicittamanuyutta]|.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, a forest dweller, an alms gatherer, a wearer of rag robes, one with only three robes, with few desires, content, secluded, disentangled, with energy aroused, an advocate of ascetic practices, engaged in meditation.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“|Not speaking ill::refraining from slander, not blaming others [anūpavāda]|, |not causing harm::not hurting, non-violence [anūpaghāta]|,
restraint according to the |moral code::monastic code of discipline which promotes harmonious and pure conduct with others [pātimokkha]|;
Knowing |moderation in::knowing the correct amount of [mattaññutā]| meals,
dwelling in a |quiet::isolated, secluded, solitary; lit. towards the end [panta]| abode;
Dedication to the |higher mind::meditation, mental development, higher consciousness, [adhicitta]|,
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.”
