Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time, by and large, the people in Sāvatthi lived clinging to sensual pleasures—|infatuated by::inflamed by, enamoured by [rattā]|, desirous for, bound by, fixated with, attached to, blinded by, and intoxicated with sensual pleasures.

Then the Blessed One, after dressing in the morning and taking his alms bowl and outer robe, entered Sāvatthi for alms. There, he saw that by and large, the people in Sāvatthi lived clinging to sensual pleasures—infatuated by, desirous for, bound by, fixated with, attached to, blinded by, and intoxicated with sensual pleasures.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“|Blinded by sensual desire::deluded by passion [kāmandha]|, enveloped by the net [of lust],
covered with the coating of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|;
Bound by the |kin of the careless::epithet of Māra, embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in cyclic existence [pamattabandhu]|,
like fish in the mouth of a trap;
They approach old age and death,
like a calf suckling its mother.”
