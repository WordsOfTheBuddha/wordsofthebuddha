Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time, the venerable Nanda, the Blessed One’s brother and |cousin::lit. mother's sister's son [mātucchāputta]|, said this to a number of bhikkhus: “Friends, I lead the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| |dissatisfied::discontent [anabhirata]|. I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I will give up the training and |revert back to lay life::return to the secular world; lit. goes back to the low [hīnāyāvattati]|.”

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the venerable Nanda, the Blessed One’s brother and cousin, said this to a number of bhikkhus: ‘Friends, I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied. I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I will give up the training and revert back to lay life.’”

Then the Blessed One instructed a certain bhikkhu: “Come, bhikkhu, in my name, go to Nanda and tell him: ‘The Teacher calls you, friend Nanda.’” “Yes, venerable sir,” that bhikkhu replied to the Blessed One. He went to the venerable Nanda, and on arrival said: “The Teacher calls you, friend Nanda.”

“Yes, friend,” the venerable Nanda replied to that bhikkhu and he went to the Blessed One. Having approached the Blessed One, he paid homage and sat down to one side. When the venerable Nanda was seated there, the Blessed One said to him:

“Nanda, is it true that you said to a number of bhikkhus: ‘Friends, I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied. I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I will give up the training and revert back to lay life’?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“But why do you, Nanda, lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, unable to keep it up, saying that you will give up the training and revert back to lay life?”

“As I was leaving from home, venerable sir, the Sakyan lady, renowned as the country’s beauty queen, with her hair half-combed, looked back at me and said: ‘Come back quickly, dear sir.’ Remembering that, venerable sir, I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied. I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I will give up the training and revert back to lay life.”

Then the Blessed One, taking venerable Nanda by the arm — just as easily as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm — disappeared from the Jeta’s Grove and appeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three.

Now at that time, about five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs had come to attend on Sakka, lord of the gods. Then the Blessed One said to venerable Nanda: “Nanda, do you see these five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“What do you think, Nanda? Which is more beautiful, lovelier to behold, and more pleasing: the Sakyan lady, renowned as the country’s beauty queen, or these five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs?”

“Venerable sir, the Sakyan lady, though renowned as the country’s beauty queen, is like a disfigured she-monkey with curtailed ears and nose, when compared with these five hundred celestial nymphs. She does not count, does not amount even to a fraction, does not stand any comparison. These five hundred celestial nymphs are indeed more beautiful, lovelier to behold, and more pleasing.”

“Take delight, Nanda! Take delight, Nanda! I am your |guarantor::assurer, security [pāṭibhoga]| for the gaining of these five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs.”

“If the Blessed One, venerable sir, is truly my guarantor for the gaining of these five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs, then I will take great delight in leading the spiritual life under the Blessed One.”

Then the Blessed One, taking venerable Nanda by the arm — just as easily as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend back his extended arm — disappeared from among the gods of the Thirty-Three and reappeared at the Jeta’s Grove.

The bhikkhus heard: “It seems the venerable Nanda, who is both the Blessed One’s brother and cousin, is leading the spiritual life for the sake of celestial nymphs; and that the Blessed One has become his guarantor for the gaining of five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs.”

Then the fellow bhikkhus, companions of venerable Nanda, mocked him with the words ‘wage labourer’ and ‘bought man,’ saying: “We heard the venerable Nanda is nothing more than a wage labourer, we heard the venerable Nanda is nothing more than a bought man — leading the spiritual life for the sake of celestial nymphs; and that the Blessed One has become his guarantor for the gaining of five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs.”

|Troubled by::being perturbed by [aṭṭīyamāna]| his companions’ mocking him as a ‘wage labourer’ and a ‘bought man,’ the venerable Nanda, ashamed and disgusted, withdrew into seclusion, dwelling |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|, |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, and |determination::resolve, the quality of applying oneself [pahitatta]|. And not long after, he realized for himself in that very life with |direct knowledge::experiential realization [abhiññā]|, the |perfection of the spiritual life::ideal of the spiritual path, culmination of the spiritual life [brahmacariyapariyosāna]|, for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it, he abided in it. He understood: “Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.” And the venerable Nanda became one among arahants.

Then, when the night had advanced, a certain deity, of surpassing beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, she stood at one side. Standing to one side, that deity said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the venerable Nanda, the Blessed One’s brother and cousin, with the |wearing away of the taints::gradual exhaustion and elimination of the mental defilements or deep-seated afflictions such as sensual desire, craving for existence, views, and ignorance [āsava + khaya]|, has realized for himself in this very life, with direct knowledge, the taintless |liberation of mind::emancipated by mind/heart, samādhi obtained from fruition [cetovimutti]| and |liberation by wisdom::emancipation by insight [paññāvimutti]|, and having realized it, he abides in it.” Knowledge arose in the Blessed One: “Nanda, with the wearing away of the taints, has realized for himself in this very life, with direct knowledge, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and having realized it, he abides in it.”

Then, when the night had passed, the venerable Nanda went to the Blessed One. Having approached the Blessed One, he paid homage and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the venerable Nanda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, with regard to the Blessed One being my guarantor for the gaining of the five hundred dove-footed celestial nymphs, I now release the Blessed One from that |promise::agreement [paṭissava]|.”

“Nanda, having encompassed your mind with my mind, I have known: ‘Nanda, with the wearing away of the taints, has realized for himself in this very life, with direct knowledge, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and having realized it, he abides in it.’ A deity also reported this to me: ‘Venerable sir, the venerable Nanda, the Blessed One’s brother and cousin, with the wearing away of the taints, has realized for himself in this very life, with direct knowledge, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and having realized it, he abides in it.’ When your mind was freed from the taints by |not grasping::not holding, detaching [anupādāya]|, I was released from that promise.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Who has crossed over the |swamp::mire [paṅka]|,
and crushed the thorn of |sensual pleasures::sense desires, wishing, wanting, delighting in [kāma]|;
Who has attained the wearing away of |delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|,
that bhikkhu does not |shake::tremble, agitate [vedhatī]| in |pleasure and pain::ease and discomfort, happiness and sorrow [sukhadukkha]|.”
