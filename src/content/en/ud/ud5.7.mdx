Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now, at that time, the venerable |Revata the doubter::foremost disciple of the Buddha in jhāna [kaṅkhārevata]| was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a |cross-legged sitting position::meditation posture [pallaṅka]|, aligning his body upright, |reviewing::reviewing on, looking at [paccavekkhamāna]| his own purification through the overcoming of |doubt::uncertainty, perplexity, hesitation—especially in relation to faith, truth, or decision-making on the path [kaṅkhā]|.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Revata the doubter sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, reviewing his own purification through the overcoming of doubt.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Whatever doubts there are about here or hereafter,
whether known by oneself or known from another;
Those meditators abandon them all,
practicing the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|.”
