Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling near |Gayā::name of a village [gayā]|, on |Gayā peak::name of a rock hill near Gayā; lit. Gayā's head [gayāsīsa]|. And at that time, many matted hair ascetics, during the cold winter nights in the thick of the winter season, when snow was falling, were surfacing and submerging in the Gayā river, repeatedly immersing themselves, pouring water over their bodies, and making fire offerings, thinking, “Through this, there is purification.”

The Blessed One saw those many matted hair ascetics, during the cold winter nights in the thick of the winter season, when snow was falling, surfacing and submerging in the Gayā river, repeatedly immersing themselves, pouring water over their bodies, and making fire offerings, thinking, “Through this, there is purification.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Not by water is one purified,
many people bathe here;
But in whom there is |truth::accuracy, reliability [sacca]| and Dhamma,
he is pure, he is a |sage::Brāhmaṇa, a title used by the Buddha for an Arahant, an awakened being [brāhmaṇa]|.”
