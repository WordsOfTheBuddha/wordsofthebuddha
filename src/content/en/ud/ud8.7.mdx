Thus have I heard—At one time the Blessed One was traveling along the main road in Kosala with venerable Nāgasamāla as his attendant. While on the way, venerable Nāgasamāla saw a fork in the road. Having seen it, he said to the Blessed One: “This is the path, venerable sir; let us go by this one, Blessed One.” When this was said, the Blessed One said to venerable Nāgasamāla: “This, Nāgasamāla, is the path; let us go by this one.”

For a second time, and for a third time venerable Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One: “This is the path, venerable sir; let us go by this one, Blessed One.” For a third time the Blessed One said to venerable Nāgasamāla: “This, Nāgasamāla, is the path; let us go by this one.” Then venerable Nāgasamāla put down the Blessed One’s bowl and robe right there on the ground and left: “This, venerable sir, is the Blessed One’s bowl and robe.”

Then, as venerable Nāgasamāla was going along that path, robbers came out halfway and struck him with hands and feet, broke his bowl, and tore his outer robe. Then venerable Nāgasamāla, with broken bowl and torn outer robe, approached the Blessed One; having approached and bowed to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. Seated to one side, the venerable Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One: “Just now, venerable sir, while I was going along that path, robbers came out halfway and struck me with hands and feet, broke my bowl, and tore my outer robe.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“Walking and dwelling together,
the |knowledge master::one who has complete understanding [vedagū]| mixes with |ignorant persons::those who do not know [aññajane]|;
Yet the |wise one::who is knowing, intelligent; lit. having the knowing quality [vidvant]| abandons the |harmful::injurious, bad, or evil. Encompasses the deceptively alluring that is ultimately detrimental or ruinous [pāpaka]|,
like a milk-drinking heron the water.”
