Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Now at that time, five hundred bhikkhus headed by |Yasoja::name of an Arahant monk; lit. born famous [yasoja]| had come to Sāvatthi to see the Blessed One. Then those visiting bhikkhus, while exchanging greetings with the resident bhikkhus, preparing their lodgings, and putting the bowls and robes in order, were making a loud noise and a great commotion.

Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, who are these making that loud noise and great commotion? One would think that it was the fishermen making a haul of fish.”

“These, venerable sir, are the five hundred bhikkhus headed by Yasoja who have come to Sāvatthi to see the Blessed One. These visiting bhikkhus, while exchanging greetings with the resident bhikkhus, preparing their lodgings, and putting the bowls and robes in order, are making a loud noise and a great commotion.”

“Well then, Ānanda, in my name, tell those bhikkhus: ‘The Teacher calls the venerable ones.’”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. Having replied to the Blessed One, he went to those bhikkhus, and on arrival said: “The Teacher calls the venerable ones.”

“Yes friend,” those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Ānanda. Having replied to the venerable Ānanda, they went to the Blessed One. Having approached the Blessed One, they paid homage and sat down to one side. When they were seated to one side, the Blessed One said this to those bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, what is with this loud noise and great commotion? One would think that it was the fishermen making a haul of fish.”

When this was said, the venerable Yasoja replied to the Blessed One: “These, venerable sir, are the five hundred bhikkhus who have come to Sāvatthi to see the Blessed One. These visiting bhikkhus, while exchanging greetings with the resident bhikkhus, preparing their lodgings, and putting the bowls and robes in order, are making a loud noise and a great commotion.”

“Go now, bhikkhus. I dismiss you; it is not proper for you to remain in my presence.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. Then, rising from their seats, they paid homage to him, circumambulated him keeping him on their right, tidied their lodgings, and taking their bowls and robes, set out on tour in the direction of the Vajjis. Traveling in stages through the Vajji country, they arrived at the Vaggumudā river. There, on the riverbank, they built leaf huts and entered upon the rains retreat.

Then, when the rains retreat had begun, the Venerable Yasoja addressed the bhikkhus: “Out of compassion for us, friends, the Blessed One dismissed us—desiring our welfare, wishing us well, compassionate toward us. Now, friends, let us so dwell that the Blessed One may be pleased with us.” “Yes, friend,” the bhikkhus replied to the venerable Yasoja. Then those bhikkhus, living |secluded::detached, solitary, withdrawn [vūpakaṭṭha]|, |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|, |resolute::determined, intent [pahitatta]|, and |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, during that very rainy season, all realized the three true knowledges.

Then the Blessed One, having dwelt at Sāvatthi for as long as he wished, set out on a walking tour toward |Vesāli::capital of the Licchavīs [vesālī]|. Traveling in stages, he arrived at Vesāli. There the Blessed One dwelled at Vesāli, in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.

Then the Blessed One, having encompassed the minds of the bhikkhus dwelling on the bank of Vaggumudā river with his own mind, addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, this direction seems radiant to me, as if filled with light; my mind inclines to go toward the direction where those bhikkhus are dwelling on the bank of Vaggumudā river. Ānanda, send a messenger to those bhikkhus, saying: ‘The Teacher calls the venerable ones; the Teacher wishes to see the venerable ones.’”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. Then, having assented, he approached a certain bhikkhu and said to him: “Come, friend, go to the bhikkhus dwelling on the bank of the Vaggumudā River. When you have gone there, say to them: ‘The Teacher calls the venerable ones; the Teacher wishes to see the venerable ones.’”

“Yes, friend,” that bhikkhu replied to the venerable Ānanda. Then, just as easily as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, he disappeared from the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Wood and appeared before those bhikkhus dwelling on the bank of the Vaggumudā River. Then that bhikkhu said this to the bhikkhus on the bank of the Vaggumudā River: “The Teacher calls the venerable ones; the Teacher wishes to see the venerable ones.”

“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied to that bhikkhu. Then, having tidied their lodgings and taken their bowls and robes, just as easily as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, they disappeared from the bank of the Vaggumudā River and appeared at the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Wood, in the presence of the Blessed One. Now, at that time, the Blessed One was sitting in the |imperturbable::motionless, perfectly still [āneñja]| |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|. Then the thought occurred to those bhikkhus: “In what state is the Blessed One now dwelling?” Then it occurred to them: “The Blessed One is dwelling in the imperturbable collectedness.” And they too sat down in the imperturbable collectedness.

Then venerable Ānanda, when the night had progressed and the first watch of the night had passed, rose from his seat, draped his outer robe over one shoulder, and raising his hands in reverence towards the Blessed One, said to him: “The night has progressed, venerable sir, and the first watch of the night has passed. The visiting bhikkhus have been sitting for a long time. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One exchange greetings with the visiting bhikkhus.” When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent.

For a second time, venerable Ānanda, when the night had progressed and the middle watch had passed, rose from his seat, draped his outer robe over one shoulder, and raising his hands in reverence towards the Blessed One, said to him: “The night has progressed, venerable sir, and the middle watch has passed. The visiting bhikkhus have been sitting for a long time. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One exchange greetings with the visiting bhikkhus.” For a second time, the Blessed One remained silent.

For a third time, venerable Ānanda, when the night had progressed and the final watch of the night had passed, when dawn had arisen and the night had a joyful appearance, rose from his seat, draped his outer robe over one shoulder, and raising his hands in reverence towards the Blessed One, said to him: “The night has progressed, venerable sir, and the final watch of the night has passed. Dawn has arisen and the night has a joyful appearance. The visiting bhikkhus have been sitting for a long time. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One exchange greetings with the visiting bhikkhus.”

Then the Blessed One, having emerged from that collectedness, addressed the venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, if you had known, you would not have spoken even this much. For I, Ānanda, and these five hundred bhikkhus have all been sitting in the imperturbable collectedness.”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“He who has |conquered::mastered [jita]| the thorn of |sensual pleasures::sense desires, wishing, wanting, delighting in [kāma]|,
|insult::name calling, verbal abuse [akkosa]|, slaughter, and other bonds;
Like a mountain, he stands firm, imperturbable,
that bhikkhu does not |tremble::shake, agitate [vedhatī]| amid |pleasure and pain::ease and discomfort, happiness and sorrow [sukhadukkha]|.”
