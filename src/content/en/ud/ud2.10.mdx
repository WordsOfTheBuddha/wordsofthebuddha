Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Anupiya::name of a Mallan town [anupiya]|, in the mango grove. At that time, the venerable Bhaddiya, son of |Kāḷīgodhā::name of a Sakyan princess [kāḷīgodhā]|, whether he was in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an |empty dwelling::uninhabited place, a physical home devoid of a self, e.g. a hut, a cave, forest [suññāgāra]|, frequently uttered this exclamation: “Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!”

Now several bhikkhus heard the venerable Bhaddiya, son of Kāḷīgodhā, frequently uttering this exclamation, whether he was in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling: “Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!” Hearing this, it occurred to them: “Surely, friends, the venerable Bhaddiya, son of Kāḷīgodhā, is dissatisfied with the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]|. Remembering the happiness of kingship that he formerly enjoyed as a householder, even while he is in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently utters this exclamation: ‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”

Then several bhikkhus went to the Blessed One. After approaching and paying homage to him, they sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the venerable Bhaddiya, son of Kāḷīgodhā, frequently utters this exclamation whether he is in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling: ‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’ Surely, venerable sir, the venerable Bhaddiya, son of Kāḷīgodhā, is dissatisfied with the spiritual life. Remembering the happiness of kingship that he formerly enjoyed as a householder, even while he is in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently utters this exclamation: ‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”

Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: “Come, bhikkhu, in my name, call the bhikkhu Bhaddiya, saying: ‘The teacher calls you, friend Bhaddiya.’”

“Yes, venerable sir,” that bhikkhu replied to the Blessed One. Then he went to the venerable Bhaddiya, son of Kāḷīgodhā, and said: “Friend Bhaddiya, the teacher calls you.” “Yes, friend,” the venerable Bhaddiya, son of Kāḷīgodhā, replied to that bhikkhu. He then went to the Blessed One, and after approaching and paying homage to him, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Blessed One said to the venerable Bhaddiya, son of Kāḷīgodhā:

“Is it true, Bhaddiya, that whether you are in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently utter this exclamation: ‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’?” [Venerable Bhaddiya replied:] “Yes, venerable sir.”

“But Bhaddiya, for what reason do you, whether in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, frequently utter this exclamation: ‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’?” “Formerly, venerable sir, when I was a layman exercising kingship, I was guarded and well-protected inside the palace and outside the palace, guarded and well-protected inside the city and outside the city, guarded and well-protected inside the country and outside the country. Yet, even though I was thus guarded and protected, venerable sir, I lived fearful, agitated, suspicious, and alarmed. But now, venerable sir, whether I am in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I live alone—fearless, unagitated, without suspicion, without alarm, at ease, subdued, dependent on the generosity of others, and with a mind like a deer. It is for this reason, venerable sir, that whether I am in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I frequently utter this exclamation: ‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“In whom there is no |anger::indignance, wrath, rage, the mental quality of being disturbed, being shaken up [kopa]| within,
who has gone beyond |any state of existence::continued existence; such success and failure, gain and loss, eternity and annihilation, good and evil [bhavābhava]|;
That one, without fear, at ease, |sorrow-free::free from sadness [asoka]| —
even the gods cannot see such a one.”
