Thus have I heard—At one time, the |Blessed One::Sublime One, Fortunate One, epithet of the Buddha [bhagavā]| was dwelling at |Uruvelā::name of a town in Magadha, lit. broad banks [uruvelā]| on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the foot of the goatherd’s banyan tree, having just attained full awakening. Then, for seven days, the Blessed One sat in one posture experiencing the ease of liberation. At the end of those seven days, the Blessed One emerged from that |perfect peace of mind::stability of mind, stillness of mind [samādhi]|.

Then a certain brahmin of the |Huṁhuṅka clan::humphy, huffy, one who snorts to express indignation or derision [huṁhuṅka + jātika]| approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After the exchange of courteous and polite conversation, he stood to one side. Standing to one side, that brahmin said this to the Blessed One: “To what extent, dear Gotama, is one a Brāhmaṇ, and what are the qualities that make one a Brāhmaṇ?”

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“That brahmin who has renounced |harmful::injurious, bad, or evil. Encompasses the deceptively alluring that is ultimately detrimental or ruinous [pāpaka]| qualities,
not huffy, free from impurities, and self-restrained;
Who has realized the highest wisdom and fulfilled the spiritual life,
in accordance with the |Dhamma::the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, he could speak about |Brāhmaṇ::sage, Brāhmaṇ is a title used by the Buddha for an Arahant, an awakened being [brahma]|;
for him, there is no |prominence::arrogance, conceit, self-importance [ussada]| anywhere in the world.”
