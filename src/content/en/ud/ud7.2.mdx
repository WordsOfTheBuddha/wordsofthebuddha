Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. At that time, the venerable Sāriputta, thinking the venerable Lakuṇḍaka Bhaddiya to be a |trainee::learner, one of the seven stages of a noble person before full awakening [sekha]|, instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened him even more in various ways with a talk on the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|.

The Blessed One saw the venerable Sāriputta instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the venerable Lakuṇḍaka Bhaddiya even more in various ways with a talk on the Dhamma, considering him to be a trainee.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

“He has cut off the cycle, gone beyond all |longing::wish, desire, hope, expectation [āsa]|,
the dried-up stream no longer flows;
The cycle, cut, revolves no more,
this is the end of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”
