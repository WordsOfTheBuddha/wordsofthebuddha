title: Upasīvamāṇavapucchā - Questions of Upasīva
description: The venerable Upasīva asks the Buddha for a basis to rely upon to cross the great flood of existence. He then inquires about the destiny of one who is fully liberated.
qualities: ending, craving, with nothing, formless
theme: inspiration, wisdom, principle
slug: snp5.6
character: Venerable Upasīva
commentary: "[1] Per the commentary to the Suttanipāta, the venerable Upasīva was one who naturally gained the attainment of the base of nothingness but he did not know it as a support. When the Buddha says, “Perceiving nothingness,” he is showing him to use that as a support to rely on."

“Alone, |Sakka::man of the Sakyan race, referring to the Buddha here [sakka]|, unsupported,”
(said the venerable Upasīva)
“I am not able to cross over the great flood;
Declare to me a |basis::foundation, support [ārammaṇa]|, O |All Seeing One::epithet of the Buddha [samantacakkhu]|,
relying on which I might cross over this flood.”

“Perceiving nothingness <sup>[1]</sup>, |mindful::who has recollection, is aware, present [satimant]|,
(Upasīva,” said the Blessed One)
“relying on ‘there is not,’ cross over the flood;
Giving up sensual pleasures, abstaining from |talk::conversation, debate, detailed discussion [katha]|,
night and day, see into the |wearing away of craving::depletion of desire, extinction of longing [taṇhakkhaya]|.”

“One |free from passion::without lust [vītarāga]| for all sensual pleasures,”
(said the venerable Upasīva)
“relying on nothingness, having left |conception::imagination, thought [mañña]|;
Liberated in the |supreme release of perception::highest meditation attainment with sense perception [saññāvimokkha]|,
would he remain there, without falling back?”

“One free from passion for all sensual pleasures,
(Upasīva,” said the Blessed One)
“relying on nothingness, having left conception;
Liberated in the supreme release of perception,
he would remain there, without falling back.”

“If he would remain there without falling back,
even for a multitude of years, O All Seeing One;
would he become cool and liberated right there?
[or] would the |consciousness::that dependently arisen knowing which, when rooted in ignorance and supported by intentional constructs, finds a footing and becomes established in a sense realm, a form realm, or a formless realm leading to production of renewed existence in the future [viññāṇa]| of such a one |pass away::die, fall away [cavati]|?”

“As a flame, thrown by the force of the wind,
(Upasīva,” said the Blessed One)
“goes to its end and cannot be defined;
So too, the sage, freed from the |mental body::mind group; immaterial constituents (excluding consciousness); lit. name body [nāmakāya]|,
goes to his end, he cannot be defined.”

“But does one who has gone to his end not exist,
or else is he |intact::free from disease, healthy [aroga]| through eternity?
Explain this matter clearly to me, O sage,
for this Dhamma has been understood by you.”

“Of one who has gone to his end, there is no
measure, (Upasīva,” said the Blessed One)
“no means by which they might speak of him;
When all phenomena have been uprooted,
all |pathways of speech::linguistic concepts, modes of expression [vādapatha]| are also uprooted.”
