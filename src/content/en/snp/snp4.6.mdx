Wow! This life is brief,
even before a hundred years it passes away;
Even if one lives beyond this,
one still dies by growing old.

People grieve over what they call ‘mine,’
but no possessions are |lasting::permanent, stable, not in flux [nicca]|;
This [world] is marked by separation,
seeing this — one should not live the home life.

Whatever a person |conceives::thinks, imagines, presumes, supposes [maññati]| as, ‘this is mine,’
at death, that too is given up;
Realizing this, the |wise::astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]| disciple,
should not incline to |self-identification::possession, taking as ‘mine’ [mamatta]|.

Just as, on waking up, a person does not see,
what was encountered in a dream;
So too, the beloved,
having |passed away::died; lit. did time [kālaṅkata]| and departed, is seen no more.

Even those people who have been seen and heard,
whose name is spoken [in the world];
Only their name will remain,
a word for the one now departed.

Those who are |greedy::desirous [giddha]| for |mine-ness::possession, cherishing, sense of ownership [mamāyita]|,
do not abandon |sorrow::grief, sadness [soka]|, |lamentation::wailing, crying [parideva]|, and |stinginess::selfishness, meanness, tight-fistedness [macchara]|;
Therefore, the sages, |seeing true safety::who sees sanctuary [khemadassī]|,
wandered having abandoned |possessions::attachments, grasping, worldly belongings [pariggaha]|.

For the bhikkhu who wanders |withdrawn::secluded, solitary [patilīna]|,
resorting to a solitary seat;
They say it is fitting for him,
to not show himself in a dwelling place.

The sage, |disengaged::detached, independent [anissita]| in every respect,
makes nothing |dear::beloved [piya]|, nor anything |disliked::an enemy, an opposition [appiya]|;
Sorrow or elation do not take hold in him,
like water does not cling to a leaf.

Just as a drop of water does not stick to a lotus leaf,
or to the lotus flower;
So too, the sage remains unstained,
by what is seen, heard, or |sensed::noticed, smelled, tasted, felt or thought [muta]|.

The purified one does not conceive,
based on what is seen, heard, or sensed;
He does not wish for purity through another,
for he neither |clings::finds pleasure in, is enamored with, is attached to [rajjati]| nor |spurns::rejects, is indifferent to [virajjati]|.
