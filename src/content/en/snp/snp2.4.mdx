Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then, when the night had advanced, a certain deity, of surpassing beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s grove, approached the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, she stood at one side. Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

“Many |deities::gods [devas]| and human beings,
have pondered over |blessings::prosperity, lit. auspicious [maṅgala]|;
Desiring |well-being::safety, sanctuary [sotthāna]|, [they ask],
Tell us the highest blessing.”

“Not associating with the |immature::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]|,
associating with the |wise::astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]|;
honoring those worthy of veneration—
This is the highest blessing.

Living in a suitable place,
having made merit in the past,
being rightly resolved in oneself—
This is the highest blessing.

Deep learning and skill,
|discipline::training [vinaya]| thoroughly mastered,
speech that is well-spoken—
This is the highest blessing.

Caring for one’s mother and father,
supporting one’s wife and children,
and work that is |not stressful::not entangled [anākula]|—
This is the highest blessing.

Generosity and righteous conduct,
looking after one’s relatives,
and |irreproachable::blameless [anavajja]| in actions—
This is the highest blessing.

Abstaining and refraining from |injurious actions::harmful, bad, potentially evil deeds [pāpā]|,
restraint regarding intoxicating drinks,
and |diligence::quality of wishing to do one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]| in the Dhamma—
This is the highest blessing.

Respect and |humility::humility, politeness [nivāta]|,
|contentment::satisfaction [santuṭṭhi]| and |gratitude::thankfulness, appreciativeness [kataññutā]|,
listening to the Dhamma at |suitable time::an appropriate occasion [kāla]|—
This is the highest blessing.

|Patience::acceptance, receptivity in emotional or interpersonal contexts [khantī]| and |being easy to instruct::amenability to correction [sovacassatā]|,
seeing the |contemplatives::ascetics, holy men; lit. who make an effort [samaṇā]|,
and timely Dhamma discussion—
This is the highest blessing.

|Austerity::ascetic practice, spiritual practice [tapa]| and leading the spiritual life,
vision of the Noble truths,
and |the realization of Nibbāna::personally experiencing liberation [nibbānasacchikiriyā]|—
This is the highest blessing.

When touched by the vicissitudes of life,
whose mind does not waver,
|sorrow-free::free from sadness [asoka]|, |unblemished::pure, stainless [viraja]|, and secure—
This is the highest blessing.

Having fulfilled these conditions [for blessings],
they are undefeated in every way,
everywhere they go in safety—
This is their highest blessing.”
