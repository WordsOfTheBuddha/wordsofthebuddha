Uncertain and unknown,
is the life of mortals here;
It is difficult and brief,
and bound up with |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.

For there is no means,
by which those who have been born will not die;
Having reached old age, there is death,
for such is the nature of living beings.

Just as for ripe fruits,
are ever in peril of falling;
So for mortals who are born,
there is constant fear of death.

Just as the clay pots,
made by a potter;
All eventually end in breakage,
so too is the life of mortals.

Both the young and the old,
the |immature::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]| and the |wise::astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]| alike;
All fall under the sway of death,
all have death as their destination.

When those overpowered by death,
are departing from this world to the next world;
A father cannot protect his son,
nor relatives their kin.

Even as the relatives are looking on,
and wailing profusely;
See how each of the mortals is led away,
like a cow being led to slaughter.

Thus the world is stricken,
by death and by old age;
Therefore the wise do not sorrow,
having understood the nature of the world.

For one whose path you do not know,
by which they’ve come or where they’ve gone;
Not perceiving either end,
yet mourn without purpose.

If while he is mourning,
a |bewildered::confused, deluded [sammūḷha]| person, injuring himself;
could derive some benefit,
a |clear-seeing one::discerning one, wise person [vicakkhaṇa]| would do the same.

For neither with weeping nor with |sorrow::grief, sadness [soka]|,
does the mind attain |peace::calm, tranquility [santi]|;
Rather, greater suffering arises,
and the body too |is harmed::is disturbed, is distressed [upahaññati]|.

One becomes thin and |pale::of sickly appearance [vivaṇṇa]|,
self-inflicting harm upon oneself;
The departed are not protected by this,
vain is such mourning.

The person who does not abandon sorrow,
sinks into even greater suffering;
Grieving for the one who has passed away,
one falls under the sway of sorrow.

See how others too must go,
each according to their deeds;
Coming under death’s dominion,
living beings tremble just so.

However they may |imagine::think, suppose, conceive [maññati]| it,
it turns out otherwise;
Such is separation—
See the way of the world.

Even if a person were to live,
for a hundred years or longer;
There is separation from one’s group of relatives,
when one abandons life in this world.

Therefore, having heard it from the |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|,
and having alleviated sorrow;
Having seen that he has departed and died,
realize, “I cannot [bring the dead back to life].”

Just as, if one’s shelter were blazing,
one would extinguish the fire with water;
So too, the |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]|, |discerning::intelligent, wise [sapañña]| person,
learned, skillful person;
Swiftly blows away arisen sorrow,
as the wind scatters a tuft of cotton.

[Blow away] sorrow and |yearning::prayer, lit. muttering [pajappā]|,
and one’s own |mental distress::dejection, depression, unhappiness, grief, negative state of mind [domanassa]|;
Seeking happiness for oneself,
one should draw out the dart from oneself.

With the dart drawn out, |unattached::untied, free [asita]|,
having attained peace of mind;
Having overcome all sorrow,
sorrowless, one is |quenched::liberated from mental defilements [nibbuta]|.
