“To the meditator seated dustless,”
(said the venerable Udaya),
“|taintless::undefiled, free from effluents [anāsava]|, having done what needed to be done;
who has gone beyond |all states of mind::all mental phenomena, all things [sabbadhamma]|,
I have come in need with a question:
Tell me of liberation by |final knowledge::spiritual insight of the complete wearing away of the mental defilements; full awakening [aññā]|,
the shattering of |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|.”

“The abandoning of sensual desires,
(Udaya,” said the Blessed One),
and of |displeasure::a negative state of mind; disagreeable feeling or unease born of mental contact, mental pain [domanassa]|, both;
The |eviction::dispelling, driving out, forcing out [panūdana]| of |dullness::lack of mental clarity or alertness, inertia, mental sluggishness [thina]|,
and the warding off of |anxiety::remorse, restlessness, uneasiness, worry; lit. badly done [kukkucca]|.

Purified by |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkha]| and |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]|,
preceded by reflection on the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|;
I call this liberation by final knowledge,
the shattering of ignorance.”

“By what is the world fettered?
What is its means of locomotion?
By the abandoning of what,
is ‘|Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|’ spoken of?”

“The world is fettered by |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]|,
thought is its means of locomotion;
It is by the abandoning of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|,
that ‘Nibbāna’ is spoken of.”

“How does one live mindfully,
for |consciousness::that dependently arisen knowing which, when rooted in ignorance and supported by intentional constructs, finds a footing and becomes established in a sense realm, a form realm, or a formless realm leading to production of renewed existence in the future [viññāṇa]| to cease?
Having come to ask the Blessed One,
we would hear your word.”

“For one not seeking delight in |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|,
internally or externally;
For one living mindfully thus,
consciousness ceases.”
