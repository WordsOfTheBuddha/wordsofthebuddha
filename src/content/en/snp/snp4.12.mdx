title: Cūḷabyūha sutta - The Shorter Discourse on the Array of Views
description: The Buddha describes that disputes arise not from many truths, but from people clinging to their own views out of conceit. By labeling others "fools" to affirm their own skill, they create conflict. The path to peace lies not in proving one's view, but in abandoning all judgments.
qualities: argumentativeness, clinging to rules and observances, feuding, conceit, wrong view, speculation, passion, wisdom, immaturity, lack of discernment, stubbornness

“Each |entrenched in their own views::settled in theories, stuck in opinions [diṭṭhiparibbasāna]|,
|arguing::contending, quarrelling [viggayha]|, the skilled make diverse assertions:
‘One who knows this has understood the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
|refusing to accept::rejecting [paṭikkosanta]| this, one is |imperfect::not an adept, not consummate [akevalī]|.’

Like this, they argue and contend,
and say: ‘The other is a fool, unskilled;’
But which among them speaks the truth?
for all alike claim to be skilled.”

“If one who does not approve another’s doctrine,
is said to be a |worthless fool::useless idiot; lit. low fool [bālomaka]|, |deficient in wisdom::of inferior wisdom [nihīnapañña]|;
Then surely all are fools, utterly deficient in wisdom,
for all are entrenched in their own views.

But if by their own |view::belief, an opinion, a concept, a theory [diṭṭhi]|, they are purified,
with perfected understanding, skill, and intelligence;
Then there is none among them lacking in wisdom,
for their views are similarly reached.

I do not say, ‘This is true,’
as the fools mutually say to each other;
They all take their own view as |true::accurate, correct [sacca]|,
therefore they regard the other a fool.”

“What some proclaim as true, calling it genuine,
others declare it to be empty and false;
So they dive into arguments and disputes—
why is that ascetics do not all speak one truth?”

“Truth, indeed, is one—there is no second,
which, if understood, would end disputes among beings;
Yet they each |proclaim::praise [thunāti]| their own diverse ‘truths,’
that is why ascetics do not all speak as one.”

“Why then do they proclaim many different ‘truths,’
those experts who assert themselves as wise?
Are there indeed many diverse truths that have been heard,
or is it that they simply follow after |speculation::conjecture, logic, reasoning [takka]|?”

“Truths surely are not many and diverse,
except by [mistakenly] perceiving |permanence::ever lastingness, immutability, stability [nicca]| in the world;
Relying on speculation, they |theorize::construct, formulate [kappayati]| their views,
and thus declare a duality of ‘truth’ and ‘falsehood.’

By seen, heard, sensed, or by |ethics and observances::precepts and practices, rites and rituals [sīlavata]|—
dependent on these, they perceive |disrespect::contempt, disdain [vimāna]|;
Taking a stand upon judgment, |being thrilled::being pleased with oneself, being elated [pahassamāna]|,
they declare: ‘The other is a fool, unskilled.’

They regard another as a fool on the same grounds,
by which they proclaim themselves as skilled;
Claiming to be an expert by their own authority,
they disparage another while conveying the same thing.

Caught up in an extreme view,
intoxicated by |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|, imagining oneself as perfected;
One |mentally anoints oneself::self-crowns themselves in thought [manasābhisitta]|,
for that view of theirs is adopted in such a manner.

If one is deficient because of another’s word,
then that other is similarly deficient in wisdom;
If by one’s own authority, one can be declared |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]|, |with perfect knowledge::who has complete understanding [vedagū]|,
then no one would be a fool among ascetics.

‘Those who assert a teaching different from this,
have failed to reach purity, and are |incomplete::imperfect, not an adept [akevalī]|’—
Thus the sectarians speak in diverse ways,
for they are |infatuated with::enamoured with [abhiratta]| passion for their own views.

‘Here alone is purity,’ so they claim,
they say there is no purification in other teachings;
Thus the sectarians, diversely entrenched,
stand firm in asserting their own path.

Asserting firmly in one’s own way,
whom here could they call a fool?
It is they themselves who would stir up dispute,
by calling another a fool of impure character.

Based on a judgment, taking themselves as the |measure::appraiser, evaluator [pamāya]|,
they enter upon further disputes in the world;
Having abandoned all judgments,
a person does not stir disputes in the world.”
