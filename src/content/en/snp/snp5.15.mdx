“Twice I have asked |Sakka::man of the Sakyan race, referring to the Buddha here [sakka]|,”
(said the venerable Mogharāja),
“but the One with Vision did not answer me;
Yet I have heard that the divine sage,
answers upon the third request.

As to this world, the other world,
the Brahma world together with the gods,
I do not know your |view::belief, an opinion, a concept, a theory [diṭṭhi]|,
O renowned |Gotama::family name of the Buddha [gotama]|.

Thus, (to) one of excellent vision,
I have come in need with a question;
How does one |look upon::regard, view [avekkhanta]| the world,
so that the King of Death does not see one?”

“Look upon the world as |empty::non-subjective [suññata]|,
Mogharāja, being ever |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]|;
Having uprooted the |sense of self::concept of identity, speculation about self, view that the self exists [attānudiṭṭhi]|,
one might thus cross over death;
The King of Death does not see,
one who looks upon the world in this way.”
