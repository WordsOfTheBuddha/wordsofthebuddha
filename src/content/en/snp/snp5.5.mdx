“I ask you, Blessed One, please tell me this,”
(thus said the venerable Dhotaka)
“I long for your word, great sage;
Having heard your |utterance::saying, speech [nigghosa]|,
I shall train for my own |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|.”

“In that case, apply |effort::exertion, application [ātappa]|,
(Dhotaka,” said the Blessed One)
“Be |prudent::sensible and careful when making judgments and decisions, astute, discerning [nipaka]| and |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of themselves [sata]| right here;
Having heard this utterance,
you should train for your own Nibbāna.”

“I see in the world of gods and humans,
A sage moving about |with nothing::without possessions; epithet of an arahant [akiñcana]|;
To that |All Seeing One::epithet of the Buddha [samantacakkhu]|, I pay homage,
free me, |Sakka::able one, capable one, proficient one [sakka]|, from |doubt::confusion, perplexity [kathaṅkathā]|.”

“I cannot free anyone in the world,
Dhotaka, who is doubtful;
But |directly knowing::experientially understanding [abhijānamāna]| the |foremost::best, most important [seṭṭha]| |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
you will thus cross this flood.”

“Extending |compassion::mental quality of wise empathy in response to suffering, which counters qualities of harm or cruelty [karuṇā]|, instruct me, O Brahmā,
the |principle of true knowledge::nature of understanding [vivekadhamma]| that I myself may comprehend;
Just as space is totally unobstructed,
I would fare on peaceful and |unattached::untied, free [asita]|.

“I will proclaim that |peace::calm, tranquility [santi]|,
(Dhotaka,” said the Blessed One)
“directly visible, not based on hearsay;
Having understood which, living mindfully,
one can cross over |attachment to::ensnarement in, entanglement in [visattika]| the world.”

“And I delight in, great sage,
in that unsurpassed peace;
Having understood which, living mindfully,
one can cross over attachment to the world.”

“Whatever you |know::comprehend, are aware of, perceive [sampajānāti]|,
(Dhotaka,” said the Blessed One)
“above, below, across, and in the middle;
Having known this as a |sticking point::bond, snare, clinging, attachment, holding on [saṅga]| in the world,
do not crave for |any state of existence::continued existence; such success and failure, gain and loss, eternity and annihilation, good and evil [bhavābhava]|.”
