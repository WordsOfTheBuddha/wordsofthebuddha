“For one who engages in sexual intercourse,”
(thus said the venerable Tissa Metteyya)
“speak of the |vexation::affliction, distress, obstacles [vighāta]|, dear sir;
Having heard your teaching,
we shall practice in |seclusion::solitude [viveka]|.”

“When one engages in sexual intercourse,
(Metteya,” said the Blessed One)
“even the teaching itself |is forgotten::is disregarded, is not heeded [mussati]|;
And one practices wrongly,
this is considered ignoble in him.

One who previously lived alone,
but then engages in sexual intercourse;
Is like a vehicle that is veering off course,
in the world, they call him a |diminished::defeated, deficient, inferior [hīna]| ordinary person.

Whatever fame and renown he previously enjoyed,
these decline and disappear for him;
Having seen these, one should train,
to abandon sexual intercourse.

|Afflicted by::attacked by, overwhelmed by [pareta]| his |intentions::conceptions, notions [saṅkappe]|,
he |broods::obsesses, thinks moodily [jhāyati]| like a |miser::poor, wretch [kapaṇa]|;
Having heard the |criticism::blame, rebuke [nigghosa]| of others,
such a one becomes |troubled::upset, disturbed [maṅku]|.

Then he prepares |words in retaliation::lit. weapons [in defense], (comm) verbal misconduct [sattha]|,
when incited by the |words of others::philosophical belief of others [paravāda]|;
This is a great thicket for him,
that he sinks into |false speech::lie, untruth [mosavajja]|.

He was regarded as a wise man,
when he was dedicated to |solitary life::going about or living alone [ekacariya]|;
But when he engaged in sexual intercourse,
like a |dull-witted one::tender, weak, undeveloped [manda]|, he |is dragged through the dirt::is soiled [parikissati]|.

Having understood this danger,
the sage, here in the before and after;
should steadfastly pursue a solitary life,
and not resort to sexual intercourse.

One should train only in seclusion,
this is the supreme path among the Noble Ones;
One should not consider oneself ‘best’ because of this,
then one is indeed near to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.

As the sage wanders empty of desires,
indifferent to sensual pleasures;
Having crossed the flood, they’re envied,
by those bound to sensual pleasures.
