Arouse yourselves, sit up!
What good to you is sleeping?
For what sleep can there be for the |afflicted::unhealthy, diseased [ātura]|,
for those suffering, pierced by the dart.

Arouse yourselves, sit up!
Steadfastly train for the state of peace.
Do not let the King of Death, knowing you as |negligent::inattentive, careless, intoxicated [pamatta]|,
deceive you and bring you under his sway.

That by which gods and humans,
bound, remain |desiring::seeking, wanting [atthika]|;
break free from this |entanglement::attachment [visattikā]|.
Let not the moment pass you by;
for those who let the moment pass, sorrow
when consigned to hell.

Negligence is defilement,
defilement arises from negligence;
By |diligence::quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]| and wisdom,
may one extract the dart from oneself.”
