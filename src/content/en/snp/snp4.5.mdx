Settled in views seen as |sublime::ultimate, very best; lit. furthest [parama]|,
whatever a person |esteems::constructs, themselves make out [karoti]| as superior in the world;
From that, he says all others are ‘|inferior::deficient, low [hīna]|,’
and thus, he does not overcome |dispute::argument, contention [vivāda]|s.

Whatever one perceives as beneficial,
in what is seen, heard, |sensed::noticed, smelled, tasted, felt or thought [muta]|, or by |ethics and observances::precepts and practices, rites and rituals [sīlavata]|;
Clinging to that very thing,
one sees all else as inferior.

The skilled call this a knot,
when based on [clinging], one supposes others as inferior;
Therefore, in whatever is seen, heard, sensed,
or in ethics and observances, a bhikkhu shouldn’t |depend::lean down on [nissayati]|.

One should not construct any view in the world,
based on knowledge or ethics and observances;
Let one not consider oneself as ‘equal,’
or think of oneself as ‘inferior’ or ‘superior.’

Having abandoned |grasping::taking up, seizing, seeing as personal, seen as self [atta]| and |not clinging to  [anything]::not taking as mine, not grasping onto, not taking possession of [anupādiyāna]|,
one does not create a dependency even on |having insight::understanding, having knowledge [ñāṇa]|;
Not taking sides among those who are divided,
one does not fall back on any view whatsoever.

For whom no |aspiration::determination, prayer [paṇidhi]| here exists |for either end::for two extremes [ubhonte]| <sup>[1]</sup>,
or for |various states of existence::continued existence; such success and failure, gain and loss, eternity and annihilation, good and evil [bhavābhava]|, here or in another world;
There are no abodes of attachment for him,
|evaluating::discriminating, distinguishing the difference [niccheyya]| among |Dhammas::Per commentary, this refers to the sixty-two speculative views. In the broader sense, this can mean all phenomena [dhamme]|, he grasps at nothing.

In what is seen, heard, or sensed,
not even the slightest |notion::conception, label, perception [sañña]| is |formulated::(of an idea or opinion) imagined, fabricated, fashioned, designed, devised, concocted [pakappita]| by him;
That sage who does not cling to any view,
how could anyone in the world |categorize::define, theorize [vikappayati]| him?

They do not |theorize::construct, formulate [kappayati]|, they do not |emphasize::put forward; lit. put in front [purekkharoti]|,
they do not subscribe to any of the doctrines;
A sage cannot be led by ethics and observances,
having gone beyond, the |steadfast one::unmoved, unaffected [tādī]| does not fall back.
