Engaging in views deemed the ultimate,
A being in the world acts on what is considered superior;
From this stance, he declares others as inferior,
and thus, he does not overcome disputes.

Whatever one perceives as beneficial,
in what is seen, heard, in virtues or in what is perceived;
He clings to that very thing,
thereby seeing all else as inferior.

The wise call this a knot,
where one, relying on it, views others as inferior;
Therefore, indeed, in whatever is seen, heard, perceived,
or practiced, a bhikkhu shouldn’t depend.

In this world, he should not form views,
based on knowledge or on ethics and observances,
Let him not consider himself as an ‘equal’,
nor as ‘inferior’ nor as ‘superior’.

Having abandoned the self and not clinging to anything,
he does not seek support even in knowledge;
Among those who are learned, he takes no sides,
nor holds onto any views.

With no inclination towards either extreme,
neither for existence nor non-existence, here or beyond;
He clings to nothing at all,
and upon thorough examination, he comprehends all phenomena.

In such a state, he perceives what is seen, heard, or sensed,
carries not even the slightest presupposed perception;
Such a Brahmin, unattached to views,
how could one in the world theorize about or define him?

They do not invent nor emphasize,
they do not hold onto even the teachings;
A Brahmin, led not by virtue alone,
having reached the far shore, does not return.
