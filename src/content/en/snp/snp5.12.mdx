“Of him who has left the home behind,
who has cut off craving and is |unshaken::unperturbed, unmoved [aneja]|,”
(said the venerable Bhadrāvudha)
“who has abandoned delight, crossed the flood, freed;
of such a wise one who has left all |speculation::fabrication, imagination [kappa]|,
I make my request, O sage:
Having heard the word of the |Noble One::noble person, epithet of an Arahant, epithet of the Buddha [nāga]|,
may they depart from here [to return no more].

Various people from different lands have gathered,
longing for hearing your word, O hero;
For their sake, explain it well,
for this |Dhamma::the ultimate truth that the Buddha’s teachings point to [dhamma]| is surely known to you.”

“One should dispel all acquisitive craving,
(Bhadrāvudha,” said the Blessed One)
“above, below, across, and in the middle;
By whatever they |cling to::grasp, hold onto, take possession of [upādiyanti]| in this world,
by that itself, |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| pursues that being.

Therefore knowing this, a mindful bhikkhu,
should not cling to anything in this world;
Observing beings entangled in grasping, [he knows]
this generation is ensnared in the realm of death.”
