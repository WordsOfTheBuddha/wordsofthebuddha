One who |restrains::curbs, controls [vineti]| arisen anger,
as the spread of snake venom is curbed with herbs;
That bhikkhu abandons |this world and the next::the here and beyond, the near and far shore [orapāra]|,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who has entirely cut off |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|,
as by diving into a lake to uproot lotus flower;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who has entirely cut off |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|,
having dried up its swift flowing stream;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who has entirely obliterated |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|,
as a mighty flood sweeps a fragile bridge of reeds;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who has found no |essence::core, the heartwood [sāra]| in states of |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|,
like one in search of flowers on a fig tree;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One within whom no |perturbation::agitation, disturbance [kopa]| remains,
who has left behind notions of |being and non-being::such success and failure, gain and loss, eternity and annihilation, good and evil [bhava + abhava]|;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One whose thoughts have been entirely |dispelled::dispersed [vidhūpita]|,
internally clarified and settled without remainder;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who neither |hastens forward::overreaching through speculative thought or prematurely drawing conclusions; giving in to assumption or expectation beyond what is grounded in clear seeing [nāccasārī]| nor |lags behind::falling short due to hesitation, doubt, or attachment to what has already been transcended; a reluctance to release the familiar or step into direct knowledge [paccasārī]|,
who has gone beyond all |mental proliferation::various opinions, endless conceptualization [papañca]|;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who neither hastens forward nor lags behind,
having known about the world,  “All this diverges from the truth”;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who neither hastens forward nor lags behind,
free from |greed::lust, wanting, desire [lobha]|, [knowing] “All this diverges from the truth”;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who neither hastens forward nor lags behind,
free from passion, [knowing] “All this diverges from the truth”;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who neither hastens forward nor lags behind,
free from |aversion::ill will, hate, hatred, fault-finding attitude, resentment [dosa]|, [knowing] “All this diverges from the truth”;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who neither hastens forward nor lags behind,
free from |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misapprehension, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|, [knowing] “All this diverges from the truth”;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One in whom no |underlying tendencies::latent dispositions [anusayā]| remain,
and whose unwholesome roots have been uprooted;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One in whom no fear-born unease remains,
with no |causes::supporting conditions [paccaya]| for a return to this side of existence;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One in whom no craving-born constructs remain,
no bonds that would lead to |attachment::being bound [vinibandha]| to existence;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.

One who, having abandoned |the five hindrances::The five hindrances are: 1) sensual desire, 2) ill will, 3) dullness and drowsiness, 3) restlessness and worry, and 5) doubt [pañca + nīvaraṇa]|,
is |untroubled::undisturbed [anigha]|, free of doubt, and with dart removed;
That bhikkhu abandons this world and the next,
like a serpent casting off its old worn-out skin.
