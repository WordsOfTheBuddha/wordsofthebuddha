“I ask you, Blessed One, please tell me this,
(thus said the venerable Mettagū)
I regard you as a |master of wisdom::who has complete understanding [vedagū]|, |who is awakened::who is self-developed, who has a developed mind [bhāvitatta]|;
From where have these sufferings arisen,
in their many forms in the world?”

“You have asked me about the origin of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,
(Mettagū,” said the Blessed One)
“I will explain to you as I have known it;
Sufferings in their many forms in the world,
have |acquisitions::attachment, taking as mine, appropriation, sense of ownership, identification [upadhi]| as their source.

The ignorant person who pursues acquisitions,
that |undeveloped one::dull-witted person [manda]| experiences suffering repeatedly;
Clearly understanding, one should not pursue acquisitions,
observing the birth and origin of suffering.”

“What we asked, you have explained to us,
now we ask you further, please tell us this;
How do the |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]| cross over the flood,
of birth and old age, sorrow and grief;
Explain this to me clearly, O Sage,
for this Dhamma is surely known to you.”

“I will proclaim to you a Dhamma,
(Mettagū,” said the Blessed One)
“directly visible, not based on hearsay;
Having understood which and living mindfully,
one can cross over |attachment to::ensnarement in, entanglement in [visattika]| the world.”

“I delight in that, O great seer,
in that unsurpassed Dhamma;
Having understood which and living mindfully,
one can cross over attachment to the world.”

“Whatever you comprehend,
(Mettagū,” said the Blessed One)
“above, below, across, and in the middle;
Having dispelled |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]| and |attachment::clinging, fixing; lit. entering down [nivesana]| in these,
|consciousness::that dependently arisen knowing which, when rooted in ignorance and supported by intentional constructs, finds a footing and becomes established in a sense realm, a form realm, or a formless realm leading to production of renewed existence in the future [viññāṇa]| will not remain in [states of] |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|.

A bhikkhu so dwelling, |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]|, |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|,
having abandoned all sense of ‘mine’;
Would abandon birth, old age, sorrow, and grief,
the wise one would cast off suffering right here.”

“I rejoice in this word of the great seer,
well proclaimed, Gotama, is the state |free from attachments::free from acquisitions, free from taking things as mine; lit. not placing near state [anūpadhīka]|;
Certainly the Blessed One has abandoned suffering,
for this Dhamma is known to you.

And they too would surely abandon suffering,
whomever you, O Sage, would always instruct;
Having come to you, O Great One, I pay you homage,
perhaps the Blessed One would always instruct me too.”

“Whatever sage you know to be a master of wisdom,
|with nothing::without possessions; epithet of an arahant [akiñcana]|, unattached to sensual desire and existence;
Surely he has crossed over this flood,
he has reached the far shore, open-hearted, and free from doubt.

And the |wise::who is knowing, intelligent; lit. having the knowing quality [vidvant]| man here who is with perfect knowledge,
having untied attachment to |various states of existence::continued existence; such success and failure, gain and loss, eternity and annihilation, good and evil [bhavābhava]|;
He is |free from craving::without wanting, yearning, longing, attachment [vītataṇhā]|, |untroubled::undisturbed, calm, free from affliction [anīgha]|, |fulfilled::free from hope, desire-less [nirāsa]|,
I say that he has crossed over birth and old age.”
