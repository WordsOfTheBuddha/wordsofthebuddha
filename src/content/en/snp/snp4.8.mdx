“Here alone is purity,” they say,
Denying that there is purification in other teachings;
Based on what they rely on, they speak of purity,
Being established in diverse individual truths.

They who desire debate, entering an assembly,
Burning fools among each other;
Clinging to views dependent on others, they argue with words,
Desiring praise, they are skilled in arguing.

Engaged in debate in the midst of an assembly,
Desiring praise, there arises anxiety;
However, in defeat, they become despondent,
Upset by criticism, they seek faults in others.

When their argument is declared lacking,
Refuted by the questioners in the assembly;
One whose view is refuted laments,
Thinking they have been surpassed, they feel inferior.

These debates arise among ascetics,
In these, there is both elation and dejection;
Also seeing this, one should refrain from debates,
For there is no purpose in obtaining praise or in gaining approval.

One might be praised, however, there,
Having declared an argument in the midst of the assembly;
He laughs and becomes conceited on account of that,
Having achieved what his mind desired.

That exaltation becomes the ground for his downfall,
Filled with pride, he speaks arrogantly;
Seeing this too, one should not engage in debate,
For the wise do not claim purity through debates.

Just as a hero, challenged at the king’s feast,
Goes roaring with a desire to fight;
By whatever means, hero, you should withdraw,
There was no prior reason for this contest.

Those who cling to their views and argue,
Saying only “this is true" and debate it;
You should tell them, “There’s no point in that,”
For with debate arises opposition.

However, those who have conquered the army of defilements,
Acting with views that do not conflict with views;
What can you gain among them, Pasūra,
For they have nothing taken as supreme.

Then you, full of thoughts,
Reflecting on views in your mind;
Having come together with the pure one,
You indeed cannot keep up.
