Stuck in the cave [of ignorance], enveloped by many layers,
stands deeply mired in |delusion::illusion, hallucination, misapprehension, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|;
Such a one is far from |seclusion::solitude, detachment [viveka]|,
For sensual pleasures in the world are not |easily abandoned::easy to renounce, easy to give up [suppahāya]|.

Based upon desire, bound to enjoyment of |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|,
they are difficult to release, for one cannot be released by another;
Whether reflecting on the past or anticipating the future,
they long for these desires, recurring echoes of the past.

|Greedy::desirous [giddha]|, entangled, and |deluded by::bewildered by, deceived by [pamūḷha]| sensual pleasures,
they are cast into dire and perilous circumstances;
Led into suffering, they |lament::mourn, wail [paridevayanti]|,
'What indeed shall we become after departing from here?'”

Therefore one should |train:: practice [sikkhati]| earnestly here and now,
by discerning the causes of turmoil in the world;
One should avoid actions that provoke further discord,
for the |steadfast ones::intelligent ones, stable, wise [dhīrā]| proclaim, “Life is fleeting.”

I see in the world, beings struggling,
engulfed in craving for states of |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|;
Base individuals chatter at death’s door,
unquenched in the craving for repeated existence.

Observe them |quivering::trembling [phandamāna]| in identities claimed as ‘mine’,
just like fish in a dwindling stream of little water;
Having seen this too, one should take nothing as ‘mine’,
not forming attachments to states of existence.

Alleviating |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]| |for both ends::for two extremes [ubhonte]|^[1]^,
|completely comprehending::fully understanding [pariññā]| |contact::sense impingement, raw experience, touch [phassa]|, |without craving::not following lustful impulse, not greedy [anānugiddha]|;
Not doing anything for which one blames oneself,
the wise person is not |entangled::smeared, stuck [lippati]| by things seen or heard.

Fully understanding perception, one overcomes the |flood::deluge, torrent of defilements [ogha]|,
amidst all |possessions::attachments, grasping, worldly belongings [pariggaha]|, the sage remains disentangled;
|Having extracted the dart::With the dart of affliction and suffering removed [abbūḷhasalla]|, he wanders |with diligence::quality of doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|,
devoid of desire for this world or beyond.
