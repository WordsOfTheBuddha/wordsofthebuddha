“For one in whom sensual desires do not dwell,”
(said the venerable Todeyya)
“for whom |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| is not found;
And who has crossed over all |doubt::confusion, perplexity [kathaṅkathā]|,
what is his |deliverance::release, emancipation, freedom [vimokkha]| like?”

“For one in whom sensual desires do not dwell,
(Todeyya,” said the Blessed One)
“for whom craving is not found;
And who has crossed over all doubt,
his deliverance is without anything beyond it.”

“Is he |without expectation::fulfilled, free from hope, desireless [nirāsāsa]|, or does he still wish?
Is he wise or is he |fashioning wisdom::acting in a wise manner [paññakappī]|?
So that I may recognize the sage, O Sakyan,
please tell me this, O |All Seeing One::epithet of the Buddha [samantacakkhu]|.”

“He is without expectation, and does not wish,
he is wise, and not fashioning wisdom;
In this way, Todeyya, know the sage,
|possessing nothing::with nothing, without possessions; epithet of an arahant [akiñcana]| and unattached to |sensual existence::existence in the realm of sensual desire [kāmabhava]|.”
