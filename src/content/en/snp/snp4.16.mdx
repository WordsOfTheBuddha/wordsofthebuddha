“I have never before seen,
(said the venerable Sāriputta),
nor ever heard before from anyone;
About a teacher of such lovely speech,
who has come from Tusitā, leader of a group—

As the |clear-eyed one::who can see, gifted with sight [cakkhumant]| is seen,
in the world with its gods;
Having dispelled all |darkness::ignorance, gloom, murkiness [tamas]|,
alone he has attained true delight.

To the Buddha, |detached::untied, free [asita]|, |steadfast::unmoved, unaffected [tādī]|,
|trustworthy::not deceitful, straightforward [akuha]|, come as leader of a group;
On behalf of the many here who are bound,
I have come with an inquiry.

When a bhikkhu |has had enough::feeling aversion toward the world of sensuality [vijigucchanta]|,
and resorts to a |solitary::secluded [rittaṁ]| seat;
To the foot of a tree or a |cemetery::place of cremation, graveyard [susāna]|,
or in mountain caves;

In the various kinds of lodgings,
how many |terrors::fears, frights [bherava]| may arise;
because of which a bhikkhu should not |tremble::shake, become agitated [vedhati]|,
dwelling in a quiet retreat?

How many |dangers::difficulties, risks [parissaya]| in the world,
confront one going to the untraveled region;
[obstacles] that a bhikkhu must |overcome::endure, master, withstand [abhisambhava]|,
when dwelling in a remote retreat?

What way of speech should he adopt?
On what resorts should he rely?
What should be the |rules and observances::precepts and practices, ethics and observances, rites and rituals [sīlabbata]|,
of a bhikkhu who is |determined::resolute, applying oneself [pahitatta]|?

Having undertaken what training,
while dwelling |unified::concentrated, one-pointed [ekodi]|, |discerning::astute, wise [nipaka]|, and |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]|;
would he purify his |impurities::defilements, pollutants, stains [mala]|,
as a smith [removes the flaws] of silver?”

“What is pleasant for one who has had enough,
(The Blessed One said to Sāriputta)
who resorts to a solitary lodging;
Desiring |full awakening::enlightenment [sambodhi]| according to the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
I will explain to you as I have known it.

A wise one, a mindful bhikkhu |of bounded conduct::who is self-restrained [sapariyantacārī]|,
should not be afraid of five perils:
|Gadflies and other flies::stinging and flying insects [ḍaṁsādhipātā]|, |creeping creatures::snakes, reptiles [sarīsapā]|,
human encounters, and four-footed animals.

Nor should he be disturbed by followers of other doctrines,
even when he sees the many terrors they pose;
One seeking the good should overcome,
any other dangers [he encounters].

Struck by sickness or by hunger,
he should endure the cold and the heat;
Though affected in many ways, the homeless one,
should remain firm in |making continuous effort::persevering, striving [parakkamma]|.

He should not steal, nor speak a lie,
he should suffuse the |frail::trembling, with craving [tasa]| and |firm::stable, stationary, without craving [thāvara]| with |loving-kindness::goodwill, friendliness, benevolence [metta]|;
If he should recognize any |blemish::corruption, stirred up state [āvilatta]| of the mind,
he should dispel it as ‘a faction of the Dark One.’

Let him not fall under the sway of |anger::rage, wrath, fury, indignation [kodha]| or |arrogance::haughtiness, self-importance [atimāna]|,
their very roots he should dig out and stand firm;
Then, withstanding the pleasing and displeasing,
he should overcome them as well.

Giving precedence to |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]|, rejoicing in the good,
he should overcome those obstacles;
He should subdue discontent in the solitary lodging,
and prevail over the four grounds for lamentation.

‘What will I eat? Where will I eat?
Ugh, I slept badly! Where will I sleep tonight?’
These |distressing::lamentable, sorrowful [paridevaneyya]| thoughts should be dispelled,
by the one in training, wandering without abode.

Having obtained food and robe on appropriate occasions,
he should know |moderation::correct measure [matta]| for the sake of |contentment::gratification, satisfaction [tosana]|;
Guarded in these things, wandering restrained in the village,
even when provoked, he should not speak |harshly::roughly, sharply, unkindly [pharusa]|.

|With eyes cast down::with lowered gaze [okkhittacakkhu]| and |without wanderlust::not footloose, lit. not with restless feet [na + pādalola]|,
|engaged in meditation::intent on jhāna [jhānānuyutta]|, he should cultivate wakefulness;
|Being self-composed::internally settled, inwardly focused [samāhitatta]|, |arousing equanimity::generating equipoise [upekkhamārabbha]|,
he should cut off |restlessness::uneasiness, anxiety [kukkucciya]| and |tendency::disposition, inclination [āsaya]| to |speculate::apply logic, conjecture, think [takka]|.

A mindful one should receive reproach calmly,
and dissolve |barrenness toward::coldness toward, hard-heartedness toward [khila]| spiritual companions;
Let him speak what is wholesome while |being concise::lit. not over the limit [nātivelaṁ]|,
and let him not be concerned with |talk of the world::things which people gossip about, rumours which the people talk about [janavādadhamma]|.

Further, there are five kinds of dust in the world,
for the removal of which a mindful one should train;
One should overcome |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]| for |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]|, |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]|,
and after that, |flavors::a taste or flavor such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle notes like umami or astringency—an object of gustatory experience that can become desirable, comforting, or indulgent [rasa]|, |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]|, and |contacts::sense impingements, raw experiences, touches [phasse]|.

Having removed |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]| for these things,
a mindful bhikkhu, his mind well liberated;
By |thoroughly examining::investigating all aspects of [parivīmaṁsamāna]| the Dhamma at the proper time,
becoming |unified::becoming whole, becoming integrated [ekodibhūta]|, he dispels the darkness.”
