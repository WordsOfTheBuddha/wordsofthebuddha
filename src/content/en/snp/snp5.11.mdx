“Having heard of the hero free from desire for sensual pleasures,”
(said the venerable Jatukaṇṇi),
“I have come to ask the one |without desire::without need [akāma]| who has gone beyond the flood;
Speak about the |state of peace::tranquility, epithet of Nibbāna [santipada]|, you of innate vision,
Tell me about it, Blessed One, as it actually is.

For the Blessed One has overcome sensual desires,
like the sun overcomes the earth with its |radiance::glory, splendor [tejas]|;
O one |of vast wisdom::of extensive distinctive knowledge, discernment [bhūripañña]|, to me whose wisdom is but small,
explain the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, so that I might understand;
The abandoning, right here, of birth and old age.”

“Remove |yearning::desire, greed [gedha]| for sensual pleasures,
(Jatukaṇṇi,” said the Blessed One)
“Having seen |renunciation::going out state, rejection of sensual pleasure [nekkhamma]| |as safety::as security, as peace, as rest [khemato]|;
Do not |grasp::raise up, hold onto [uggahīta]| nor |cast aside::reject, throw away [niratta]| anything,
let neither of these be found within you.

Dry up what pertains to the past,
do not take up anything to come later;
If you will not grasp in the |present::middle [majjha]|,
you will wander |in peace::calmed, composed, cooled [upasanta]|.

For a brahmin entirely |devoid of greed::free from craving [vītagedha]|,
for |name and form::mentality and materiality—the integrated structure of mental capacities (intention, attention, contact, feeling, perception) and physical form that together constitute and sustain an individual being [nāmarūpa]| in every way;
There are no |mental defilements::mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]| found in him,
by which he might fall under the control of death.”
