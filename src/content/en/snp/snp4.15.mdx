“Fear arises from |arming oneself::violence; lit. taken stick [attadaṇḍa]|,
observe the people involved in |conflict::dispute, strife [medhaga]|;
I will recount the urgency [for awakening],
as it has |been stirred within::agitated [saṁvijita]| me.

Having seen the population |floundering::quivering, trembling [phandamāna]|,
like fish in a pool with little water;
Having seen them |at odds with::hostile to, opposed to [byāruddha]| one another,
fear came upon me.

The world was completely |essenceless::without essence, without substance [asāra]|,
all the directions were shaken [by impermanence];
Desiring a |sanctuary::home, shelter, state of existence [bhavana]| for myself,
I did not see any place uninhabited <sup>[1]</sup>.

Having seen those hostile even at the end <sup>[2]</sup>,
|dissatisfaction::dislike, discontent, aversion, boredom [arati]| came upon me;
Then I discerned the dart here,
hard to perceive, nestled within the heart.

Whoever is |struck by::affected by, afflicted with [otiṇṇa]| that dart <sup>[3]</sup>,
runs astray in all directions;
But having drawn out that very dart,
one does not run or sink down.

Here the |trainings::learnings, practices, arts, science; here this is a reference to training with elephants, horses, chariots, bows, spears, and darts, training in bodily cures, training in exorcism, training in pediatrics that were the common occupations at the time [sikkhā]| |are taught::are discussed, expressed, recited [anugīyanti]|:
Whatever things are |clung to::enslaving, a bond [gadhita]| in the world,
one should not be |engrossed in::occupied with, pursuing [pasu]| them;
Completely piercing through sensual pleasures,
One should train for |one’s own quenching::one’s own going out; lit. extinguishing of one’s self [nibbānamattano]|.

One should be truthful, |unassuming::courteous, respectful [appagabbha]|,
|without deceit::sincere [amāya]|, and |devoid of divisive speech::free from slander [rittapesuṇa]|;
Without anger, the sage should cross beyond,
the evil of greed and acquisitiveness.

One should overcome sleep, |laziness::sloth, tiredness [tandi]|, and |dullness::lack of mental clarity or alertness, inertia, mental sluggishness [thina]|,
not live together with |negligence::carelessness, heedlessness [pamāda]|;
A person whose mind is inclined to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|,
should not persist in |arrogance::haughtiness, self-importance [atimāna]|.

One should not be led into |false speech::lie, untruth [mosavajja]|,
nor form affection toward forms;
One should |completely comprehend::fully understand [parijānāti]| |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|,
and conduct oneself without |impulsiveness::haste, suddenness [sāhasa]|.

One should not take delight in the old,
nor form |a preference::an acceptance [khanti]| for the new;
One should not |sorrow::grieve [socati]| over what is declining,
nor become |dependent on::bound to [sita]| craving.

|Greed::desire, yearning [gedha]|, I say, is the great flood,
its current, I say, is |longing::burning, hunger, pining, thirst [jappā]|;
Its |basis::foundation, support [ārammaṇa]| is |conceptualization::forming intentions, theorizing [pakappanā]|,
the swamp of sensuality is difficult to escape.

Not straying from the truth, the sage,
the Awakened One stands on firm ground;
Having relinquished all,
he is indeed called |peaceful::tranquil; lit. calmed [santa]|.

He indeed is wise |who has perfect knowledge::with complete understanding [vedagū]|,
having known the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, he is independent;
Conducting himself rightly in the world,
he does not long for anything here.

Whoever here has overcome sensual pleasures,
the bond in the world so hard to overcome;
He does not grieve, does not fret,
having cut the stream [of craving], he is |unchained::unshackled [abandhana]|.

Dry up what pertains to the past,
let there be nothing for you afterwards;
If you do not grasp in the middle,
you will fare on in peace.

One who does not claim as ‘mine,’
anything at all here in |name and form::mentality and materiality—the integrated structure of mental capacities (intention, attention, contact, feeling, perception) and physical form that together constitute and sustain an individual being [nāmarūpa]|;
Who does not sorrow over what is non-existent,
such a one suffers no loss in the world.

One for whom nothing is taken
as ‘this is mine’ or ‘[this belongs] to others;’
He, not finding any sense of ‘mineness,’
does not grieve, ‘I have nothing.’

Without harshness, without greed,
|unperturbed::unruffled, unshakeable, without impulse [aneja]|, everywhere the same;
I declare these benefits,
when asked about the unwavering one.

For the unperturbed, who understands,
there is no |accumulation::fabrication, fiction, invention; (comm) accumulation of merit or demerit [nisaṅkhati]| whatsoever;
Abstinent from striving [to make merit],
he sees |security::safety, sanctuary, peace, rest [khema]| everywhere.

The sage does not speak of himself,
as among equals, inferiors, or superiors;
Peaceful, |free from stinginess::selfless, without envy, jealousy, or hostility [vītamacchara]|,
he does not grasp nor rejects.”
