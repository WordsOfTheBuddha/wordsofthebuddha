“There are sages in the world,”
(said the venerable Nanda)
“so people say, but how is this so?
Do they call a sage one endowed with knowledge,
or one following a particular way of life?”

“Not by view, nor by learning, nor by knowledge,
Nanda, do the skilled here call one a sage;
They are sages, I say, who |having disarmed::at peace; (comm) having destroyed the army of defilements [visenikatvā]|,
wander |untroubled::undisturbed, calm, free from affliction [anīgha]| and |without expectation::fulfilled, free from hope, desireless [nirāsāsa]|.”

“Those ascetics and brahmins,”
(said the Venerable Nanda)
“who claim purification by what is seen and heard;
who declare purification by |rules and observances::precepts and practices, ethics and observances, rites and rituals [sīlabbata]|,
who declare purification in many varied ways.
I wonder, Blessed One, striving in that way,
have they crossed over birth and old age, sir?
I ask you this, Blessed One, please tell me.”

“Those ascetics and brahmins,
(Nanda,” said the Blessed One)
“who claim purification by what is seen and heard;
who declare purification by rules and observances,
who declare purification in many varied ways;
Though they strive diligently in that way, I say,
they have not crossed over birth and old age.”

“Those ascetics and brahmins,”
(said the venerable Nanda)
“who claim purification by what is seen and heard;
who declare purification by rules and observances,
who declare purification in many varied ways.
If, sage, you say they haven’t crossed over the flood,
then who here in the world of gods and humans;
has crossed over birth and old age, sir?
I ask you this, Blessed One, please tell me.”

“I do not say of all ascetics and brahmins,
(Nanda,” said the Blessed One)
“that they are |enveloped::veiled, wrapped [nivuta]| by birth and old age;
Having abandoned the seen, heard, and |sensed::smelled, tasted, felt, or thought [muta]|,
and all the rules and observances;
Those who have abandoned the many varied ways,
|completely comprehending::fully understanding [pariññāya]| |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|, |taint-less::undefiled, free from effluents [anāsava]|;
those persons, I say, have crossed over the flood.”

“I delight in this word of the great sage,
well proclaimed, O Gotama, is the state |free from attachment::free from acquisition, free from taking things as mine; lit. not placing near state [anūpadhīka]|;
Having abandoned the seen, heard, and sensed,
and all the rules and observances;
Those who have abandoned the many varied ways,
completely comprehending craving, taint-less;
I too say, they have crossed over the flood.”
