For one |craving::wanting, desiring [kāmayamāna]| |sensual pleasures::sense desires, wishing, wanting, delighting in [kāma]|,
if that works out well for that person;
Surely they are |delighted::exhilarated, thrilled [pītimana]|,
having obtained what they wanted.

However, for the person bound by craving,
|whose desire has sprung up::whose interest has arisen, who is intent on [chandajāta]|;
If those sensual pleasures |deteriorate::dwindle, decline [parihāyati]|,
that one |is aggravated::is adversely affected [ruppati]| as if pierced by a |dart::any sharp pointed object which causes pain, arrow, spike, dagger, barb [salla]|.

Whoever |completely avoids::keeps away from [parivajjeti]| sensual pleasures,
just as one avoids stepping on a snake’s head with their feet;
Finds tranquility in this |entangling::ensnaring, sticky [visattika]| world,
and with |mindfulness::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]|, they surpass it.

Fields, properties, and gold,
cattle, servants, and employees;
Women, relatives, and different sensual pleasures,
when a person |yearns::is greedy, craves [anugijjhati]| for these—

weaknesses |overpower::prevail over [balīyati]| that one,
and |obstacles::risks, dangers, insecurities [parissayā]| |crush::trample, squash [maddati]| them,
From this suffering follows them,
as water fills into a broken boat.

Therefore, let one always be mindful,
and steer clear of sensual pleasures;
By abandoning them, one crosses the |flood::deluge, torrent of defilements [ogha]|,
as having bailed out the boat, one |who has gone beyond::who has crossed over [pāragū]|.
