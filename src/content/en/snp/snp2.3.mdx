One disregarding |conscience::a sense of right and wrong, an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of one's behavior, scruple [hirī]|, detesting it,
who says, "I am your friend";
But does not do what can be done,
one should know of him: "he is not my friend."

He who speaks sweet words among friends,
with no follow-through in action;
Talking but not doing,
the wise know him well.

He is not a friend who is always suspicious,
fearing a rift, ever watching for |faults::(to be used in an argument) weak-spots, openings [randha]|;
But in whom one rests, like a child on mother's breast,
that one, unbreakable by others, is truly a friend.

A state that gives rise to joy,
pleasing, and praised by the wise;
He cultivates it, anticipating its fruit,
bearing the burden of human duty.

Having tasted the flavor of |seclusion::solitude [paviveka]|,
and the nectar of inner |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|;
One is freed from fear, and without stain,
sipping in the flavor of delight in the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|.
