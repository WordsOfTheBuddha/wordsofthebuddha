This should be done by one who is |skilled in::adept in, expert in [kusalena]| goodness,
having realized the state of peace:
Let them be capable, upright and approachable,
|easy to speak to::gentle in speech [suvaca]|, |flexible::soft, pliable [mudu]|, and |humble::who is not conceited, who is not arrogant [anatimānī]|.

|Who is content::who is satisfied [santussaka]| and |easy to support::low maintenance [subhara]|,
|with few duties::with little work [appakicca]|, living lightly;
With calm faculties, |discerning::astute, wise [nipaka]|,
|unassuming::courteous, respectful [appagabbha]|, not |greedy::desirous [giddha]| for supporters.

Let them not engage in the slightest act,
that a wise person might |find fault with::criticize [upavadati]|;
Wishing: In gladness and in safety,
May all beings be |at ease::happy, with a pleased mind [sukhitatta]|.

Whatever living beings there may be,
whether |frail::trembling, with craving [tasa]| or |firm::stable, stationary, without craving [thāvara]|, without exception —
long or large,
medium, short, |subtle and gross::fine and coarse, tiny and substantial [aṇukathūla]|.

Those seen and those unseen,
those dwelling far and those near,
those born as well as those seeking birth,
May all beings be at ease.

One should not |deceive::cheat, defraud, swindle [nikubbati]| another,
nor despise anyone anywhere;
Even in |anger::rage [rosa]| or in |aversion::dislike, thoughts of resentment, lit. striking against perception [paṭighasaññā]|,
let one not |wish suffering upon::desire discomfort for [dukkhamicchati]| another.

Just as a mother would protect,
her only child at the risk of her own life,
So too, towards all beings,
one should cultivate a |boundless heart::measureless mind [aparimāṇa + mānasa]|.

With |loving-kindness::goodwill, friendliness, benevolence [metta]| towards the entire world,
cultivate a boundless heart;
Above, below, and all around,
free from animosity and hostility.

Whether standing, walking, sitting,
or lying down, |free from drowsiness::without sluggishness, without lethargy [vitamiddha]|;
One should sustain this recollection,
this here is said to be the |divine::God's [brahma]| abiding.

Without holding on to fixed views,
|virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]| and accomplished in |vision::realization [dassana]|,
Having subdued the |yearning for::desire for, greed for [gedha]| sense pleasures,
one does not come back to a womb ever again.
