Homage to the Blessed One, the |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|, the perfectly Awakened One.

I go to the |Buddha::Awakened One [buddha]| for |refuge::help, safety, shelter, protection [saraṇa]|,
I go to the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| for refuge,
I go to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| for refuge.

For the second time, I go to the Buddha for refuge,
For the second time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge,
For the second time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.

For the third time, I go to the Buddha for refuge,
For the third time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge,
For the third time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.
