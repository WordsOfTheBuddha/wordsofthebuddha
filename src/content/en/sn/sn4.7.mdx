At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.

Then, the Blessed One, having walked back and forth in the open air for much of the night, at the time before dawn, washed his feet, entered his dwelling, and lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture, placing one leg overlapping the other, |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]| and |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]|, having attended to the idea of rising up.

Then |Māra::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]| the Evil One approached the Blessed One; having approached, he recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:

“What, you’re asleep? Really, you’re asleep?
You are sleeping like a loser, what’s up with this?
Thinking ‘The hut’s empty,’ you sleep:
You sleep when the sun has risen, what’s up with this?”

“For whomever |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| no longer lurks,
|ensnaring::deceptive, lit. having a net [jālinī]| and |entangling::ensnaring, sticky [visattika]|, |to lead him astray::to misguide him [netave]|;
With the eradication of all attachment, the Awakened One
sleeps, why should this concern you, Māra?”

Then Māra the Evil One, thinking, “The Blessed One knows me, the Accomplished One knows me,” dejected and disappointed, disappeared right there.
