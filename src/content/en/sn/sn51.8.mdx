"Bhikkhus, there are these four bases of psychic abilities. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort.

These, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic abilities. It is because he has  developed and frequently practiced these four bases of psychic abilities that the Tathāgata is called 'the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One.'"
