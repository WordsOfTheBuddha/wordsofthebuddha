"|form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one's body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]|, bhikkhus, is |impermanent::unstable, transient, unreliable [anicca]|. Whatever cause, whatever supporting condition there is for the arising of form, that is also impermanent. Arising from what is impermanent, bhikkhus, how could form be |permanent::stable, not in flux [nicca]|?

|felt experience::pleasant, neutral or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| is impermanent. Whatever cause, whatever supporting condition there is for the arising of sensation, that is also impermanent. Arising from what is impermanent, bhikkhus, how could sensation be stable?

|Perception::interpretation and recognition of oneself, of things. It can involve concepts, labels, and judgments; third of the five aggregates [sañña]| is impermanent. Whatever cause, whatever supporting condition there is for the arising of perception, that is also impermanent. Arising from what is impermanent, bhikkhus, how could perception be stable?

|Volitional formations::intentions, choices, decisions, karmic activity; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]| are impermanent. Whatever cause, whatever supporting condition there is for the arising of volitional formations, that is also impermanent. Arising from what is impermanent, bhikkhus, how could volitional formations be stable?

|Consciousness::quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind]; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]| is impermanent. Whatever cause, whatever supporting condition there is for the arising of consciousness, that is also impermanent. Arising from what is impermanent, bhikkhus, how could consciousness be stable?

Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the well-studied disciple of the noble ones becomes |disenchanted with::disillusioned with [nibbindati]| form, becomes disenchanted with sensation, becomes disenchanted with perception, becomes disenchanted with volitional formations, becomes disenchanted with consciousness. Experiencing disenchantment, they become |detached::dispassionate [virajjati]|; through detachment, there is release. When released, there arises the knowledge: 'Released.'

'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being,' one understands."
