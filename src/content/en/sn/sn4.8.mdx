Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Then |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| the Evil One approached the Blessed One; having approached, he recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:

“One with children delights because of children,
one with cattle delights in the same way because of cattle;
A person’s delight is due to |acquisitions::attachment, taking as mine, appropriation, sense of ownership, identification [upadhi]|,
without acquisitions, one does not delight.”

[The Blessed One]: “One with children |sorrows::grieves [socati]| because of children,
one with cattle sorrows in the same way because of cattle;
A person’s sorrow is due to acquisitions,
without acquisitions, one does not sorrow.”

Then Māra the Evil One, thinking, “The Blessed One knows me, the Accomplished One knows me,” dejected and disappointed, disappeared right there.
