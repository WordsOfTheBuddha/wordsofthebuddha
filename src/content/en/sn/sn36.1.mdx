“There are these three |felt experiences::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, bhikkhus. What three?

Pleasant felt experience, painful felt experience, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant felt experience. These, bhikkhus, are the three felt experiences.

|Collected::composed, settled [samāhita]|, |clearly aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, deliberate, purposeful [sampajāna]|,
a |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of themselves [sata]| disciple of the Buddha;
|Discerns::distinguishes, understands, knows clearly [pajānāti]| felt experiences,
and the |arising::origin, source [sambhava]| of felt experiences.

Where these |cease::vanish, reach an end [nirujjhati]|,
and the way of practice |leading to their cessation::leading to exhaustion, leading to wearing away [khayagāmī]|;
With the cessation of felt experiences, the bhikkhu,
is |satiated::free from craving, desireless [nicchāta]| and |completely quenched [of mental defilements]::completely cooled mental defilements [parinibbuta]|.”
