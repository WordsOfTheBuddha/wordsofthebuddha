"I will teach you the way of practice that is suitable to realizing Nibbāna, bhikkhus. Listen closely.

And what, bhikkhus, is the way of practice that is suitable to realizing Nibbāna?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees the eye as a source of discontentment, sees forms as a source of discontentment, sees the arising eye-consciousness as a source of discontentment, sees the arising eye-contact as a source of discontentment. Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as a source of discontentment.

He sees the ear as a source of discontentment, hears sounds as a source of discontentment, sees ear-consciousness as a source of discontentment, sees ear-contact as a source of discontentment. Whatever feeling arises with ear-contact as its condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as a source of discontentment.

He sees the nose as a source of discontentment, smells as a source of discontentment, sees nose-consciousness as a source of discontentment, sees nose-contact as a source of discontentment. Whatever feeling arises with nose-contact as its condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as a source of discontentment.

He sees the tongue as a source of discontentment, tastes as a source of discontentment, sees tongue-consciousness as a source of discontentment, sees tongue-contact as a source of discontentment. Whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as its condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as a source of discontentment.

He sees the body as a source of discontentment, tactile sensations as a source of discontentment, sees body-consciousness as a source of discontentment, sees body-contact as a source of discontentment. Whatever feeling arises with body-contact as its condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as a source of discontentment.

He sees the mind as a source of discontentment, mental |phenomena::feelings, thoughts, emotions, memories, and perceptions| as a source of discontentment, sees mind-consciousness as a source of discontentment, sees mind-contact as a source of discontentment. Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as its condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as a source of discontentment.

This, bhikkhus, is the way of practice suitable for realizing Nibbāna."
