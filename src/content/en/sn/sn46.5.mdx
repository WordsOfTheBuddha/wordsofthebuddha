At Sāvatthi.

Then, a certain bhikkhu approached where the Blessed One was; having approached and paid homage, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘|factors of awakening::elements of enlightenment [bojjhaṅga]|, factors of awakening.’ In what way, venerable sir, are they called factors of awakening?”

“Since they lead to awakening, bhikkhu, they are called ‘factors of awakening.’

1.) Here, bhikkhu, one cultivates the |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]|, which is |supported by seclusion::dependent on detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, and |culminates in complete relinquishment::ripens in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|.

2.) One cultivates the |awakening factor of investigation of states::the quality of discriminative investigation into states, mental qualities and other phenomena; analyzing the teaching as a factor of enlightenment; second of the seven awakening factors [dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, supported by ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

3.) One cultivates the |awakening factor of energy::the quality of unrelenting effort, the sustaining power of persistence as a factor of enlightenment; third of the seven awakening factors [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, supported by ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

4.) One cultivates the |awakening factor of joy::the quality of heartfelt gladness, spiritual rapture untainted by sensuality, as a factor of enlightenment; fourth of the seven awakening factors [pītisambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, supported by ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

5.) One cultivates the |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, supported by ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

6.) One cultivates the |awakening factor of collectedness::the quality of unification, stability, and deep stillness of the mind, as a factor of enlightenment; sixth of the seven awakening factors [samādhisambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, supported by ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

7.) One cultivates the |awakening factor of equanimity::the quality of balanced observation, non-reactivity, and mental equipoise as a factor of enlightenment; seventh of the seven awakening factors [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, supported by ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

When one cultivates these seven factors of awakening, one’s mind is liberated from |taint of sensual desire::oozing sensual desire [kāmāsava]|, from the |taint of becoming::effluent of being, taint of existence [bhavāsava]|, and from the |taint of ignorance::taint of not knowing how things have come to be, illusion of knowing, distorted perception [avijjāsava]|. When liberated, there arises the knowledge: ‘Liberated.’ One understands: ‘Birth is ended, the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any |state of existence::state of being [itthatta]|.’

Since they lead to awakening, bhikkhu, they are called ‘factors of awakening.’”
