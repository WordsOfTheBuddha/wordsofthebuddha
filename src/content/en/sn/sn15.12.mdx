At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, this \{cyclic existence} (wandering from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]) is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by ignorance (fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]) and fettered by craving (wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]), run on and wander in this cycle of existence. Whenever you see anyone faring well, living happily, you should conclude: 'We too have experienced the same, over this long span of time.'

For what reason? Bhikkhus, this cyclic existence is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, run on and wander in this cycle of existence. For such a long time, bhikkhus, you have experienced suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]), agony (intense suffering, anguish [tibba]), and calamity (disaster [byasana]), the cemetery (charnel ground [kaṭasī]) has been filled up with your bones. Therefore, bhikkhus, it is enough \{to become disenchanted} (to become disillusioned [nibbindituṃ]), \{to become detached} (to become dispassionate [virajjituṁ]) and \{to become free from} (to be liberated from [vimuccituṃ]) \{all conditions} (all formations, all activities, all fabrications [sabbasaṅkhāra]).
