Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground. Then Tālapuṭa, head of a group of performers, approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near and paid homage to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Seated, the headman Tālapuṭa said to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, I have heard it said, from the ancient teachers as well as the current and former teachers among |performers::actors, dancers [naṭā]|: ‘If a performer, in the theatre or a public arena, entertains and amuses people by distortion of truth, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing deities.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?”

“That’s enough, headman, let that be; do not ask me about that.”

For a second time, <collapse>the headman Tālapuṭa said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I have heard it said, from the ancient teachers as well as the current and former teachers among performers: ‘If a performer, in the theatre or a public arena, entertains and amuses people by distortion of truth, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing deities.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?” “That’s enough, headman, let that be; do not ask me about that.”</collapse>

And for a third time, the headman Tālapuṭa said to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, I have heard it said, from the ancient teachers as well as the current and former teachers among performers: ‘If a performer, in the theatre or a public arena, entertains and amuses people by distortion of truth, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing deities.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?”

“Surely, headman, I am not getting through to you when I say, ‘That’s enough, headman, let that be; do not ask me about this.’ But still, I will explain it to you.

In the theatre or a public arena, among beings who are |not free from lust::not free from desire, i.e. not an Arahant [avītarāga]|, who are |bound with the bond of lust::imprisoned by desire, held captive by passion, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession [rāgabandhanabaddha]|, a performer entertains them with |enticing::arousing, tantalizing [rajanīya]| things that evoke lustful states even more strongly. In the theatre or a public arena, among beings who are |not free from hatred::not free from ill-will [avītadosa]|, who are |bound with the bond of hatred::imprisoned by aversion, held captive by ill-will [dosabandhanabaddha]|, a performer entertains them with hatred-inducing things that evoke hateful states even more strongly. In the theatre or a public arena, among beings who are |not free from delusion::not free from confusion, i.e. not an Arahant [avītamoha]|, who are |bound with the bond of delusion::imprisoned by illusion, held captive by delusion [mohabandhanabaddha]|, a performer entertains them with |deceptive::illusory, delusion-inducing [mohanīya]| things that evoke deluded states even more strongly. Thus, being |intoxicated::besotted, proud, conceited [matta]| and |negligent::inattentive, careless, intoxicated [pamāda]| himself, he promotes intoxication and negligence in others. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the hell called laughter.

If, headman, he holds this view: ‘When a performer entertains and amuses people by distortion of truth, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing deities,’ then that is a wrong view on his part. For a person with wrong view, I say, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal realm.”

When this was said, the headman Tālapuṭa cried out and burst into tears.

“So I did not get through to you when I said, ‘That’s enough, headman, let that be; do not ask me about this.’”

“I am not crying, venerable sir, because of what the Blessed One said to me, but because I have been deceived, tricked, and misled by the ancient teachers as well as the current and former teachers among performers, who have said: ‘If a performer, in the theatre or a public arena, entertains and amuses people by distortion of truth, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing deities.’”

“Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as if one were to set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms — even so, venerable sir, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by the Blessed One in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life.”
