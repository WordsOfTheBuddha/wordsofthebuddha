“Suppose, bhikkhus, a fisherman casts a baited hook into a deep lake. A fish with an eye for bait swallows it. That fish, having swallowed the fisherman’s hook, would meet with misfortune and disaster, and the fisherman could do with it as he wishes.

So too, bhikkhus, there are these six hooks in the world for the misfortune of beings, for the slaughter of living beings. What six?

There are, bhikkhus, |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]| cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and |enticing::arousing, tantalizing [rajanīya]|. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and |remains holding to them::remains fixated on them [ajjhosāya + tiṭṭhati]|, he is called a bhikkhu who has swallowed |Mara::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]|’s hook, who would meet with misfortune and disaster, and the |Evil One::profoundly immoral and wicked, having evil quality, epithet of Māra [pāpimant]| could do with him as he wishes.
