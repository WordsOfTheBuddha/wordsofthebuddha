“Suppose, bhikkhus, a fisherman casts a baited hook into a deep lake. A fish with an eye for bait swallows it. That fish, having swallowed the fisherman's hook, would meet with misfortune and disaster, and the fisherman could do with it as he wishes.

So too, bhikkhus, there are these six hooks in the world for the misfortune of beings, for the slaughter of living beings. What six?

There are, bhikkhus, |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]| cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and |enticing::arousing, tantalizing [rajanīya]|. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and |remains holding to them::remains fixated on them [ajjhosāya + tiṭṭhati]|, he is called a bhikkhu who has swallowed |Mara::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]|’s hook, who would meet with misfortune and disaster, and the |Evil One::profoundly immoral and wicked, having evil quality, epithet of Māra [pāpimant]| could do with him as he wishes.

There are, bhikkhus, |sounds::auditory objects such as various sounds, noises, melodic compositions, verbal expression, whether of praise, blame, honor, respect, disrespect [saddā]| cognizable by the ear that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he is called a bhikkhu who has swallowed Mara’s hook, who would meet with misfortune and disaster, and the Evil One could do with him as he wishes.

There are, bhikkhus, |odors::smells, scents, fragrances, aromas, stench, perfumes, or natural fragrances such as of flowers, food, or earth [gandhā]| cognizable by the nose that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he is called a bhikkhu who has swallowed Mara’s hook, who would meet with misfortune and disaster, and the Evil One could do with him as he wishes.

There are, bhikkhus, |tastes::flavors, tastes, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes such as umami or astringency [rasā]| cognizable by the tongue that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing.

There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain fixated on them, he is called a bhikkhu who has not swallowed Māra’s hook—who has broken Māra’s hook, completely shattered Māra’s hook, he would not fall into misfortune or disaster, and the Evil One cannot do with him as he wishes.

There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing.
