“How, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic powers developed and frequently practiced so that they are of great fruit and great benefit? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, a wish [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort thus: 'My aspiration will not be too slack, nor too intense, nor inwardly inhibited, nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware: 'As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.' Thus with a mind that is clarified and unconfined, he develops a radiant mind.”
