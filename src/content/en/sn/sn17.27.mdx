At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, whoever among ascetics or brahmins does not clearly understand acquisitions, respect, and popularity as they truly are; does not clearly understand the |arising::appearance, origination [samudaya]| of acquisitions, respect; and popularity, does not clearly understand the |ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]| of acquisitions, respect, and popularity; and does not clearly understand the way of practice leading to the ending of acquisitions, respect, and popularity—they, bhikkhus, are not recognized by me as ascetics among ascetics or as brahmins among brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones do not, in this very life, |personally experience::realize for oneself [sacchikatvā]| and attain the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood through |direct knowledge::experiential realization [abhiññā]| and |abiding::dwelling, remaining, staying [viharanti]| in it.

But bhikkhus, whoever among ascetics or brahmins clearly understands acquisitions, respect, and popularity as they truly are; clearly understands the arising of acquisitions, respect, and popularity; clearly understands the ending of acquisitions, respect, and popularity; and clearly understands the way of practice leading to the ending of acquisitions, respect, and popularity—they, bhikkhus, are recognized by me as ascetics among ascetics and as brahmins among brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones, in this very life, personally experience and attain the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood through directly knowing and abiding in it.”
