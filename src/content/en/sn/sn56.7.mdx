"Bhikkhus, do not think thoughts that are |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]|, such as thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill-will, and \|thoughts of harming::idea of hurting [vihiṁsāvitakka]|. What is the reason for this? Bhikkhus, these thoughts are not connected with benefit, they are not essential to the spiritual life, nor do they lead to \|disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]|, to the \|fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|, to \|gradual ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]|, to |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|, to \|direct knowing::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, to \|full awakening::perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]|, to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.

But, bhikkhus, when you do think, you should think: 'This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|'; you should think: 'This is the \|arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|'; you should think: 'This is the \|ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|'; you should think: 'This is the \|way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the noble eightfold path [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.' What is the reason for this? Bhikkhus, these thoughts are connected with benefit, they are essential to the spiritual life, they lead to disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowing, to full awakening, to Nibbāna.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to \|fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
