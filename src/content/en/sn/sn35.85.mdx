Then, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:

"'|Empty::devoid of essence [suñña]| is the world, empty is the world', it is said, venerable sir. In what sense, venerable sir, is it said, 'empty is the world'?"

"Because, Ānanda, it is empty of |self::soul, spirit, essence, personal, related to oneself [atta]| and of what belongs to a self, therefore it is said, 'empty is the world'. And what, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self?

The tongue, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. |Tastes::flavors, tastes, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes such as umami or astringency [rasā]| are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, |tongue-consciousness::gustatory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [jivhāviññāṇa]| is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, |tongue-contact::the meeting of tongue, taste, and tongue-consciousness, giving rise to a taste impression/impingement/intrusion [jivhāsamphassa]| is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

Whatever |feeling::felt experience on contact, sensation [vedanā]| arises with mind-contact as condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.
