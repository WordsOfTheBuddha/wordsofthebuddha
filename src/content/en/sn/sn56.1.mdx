At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, cultivate |collectedness::stability of mind, mental composure, concentrated mind [samādhi]|. A bhikkhu who is collected discerns |as it truly is::as it has come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|. What does he discern as it truly is?

'This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,' he discerns as it truly is;
'This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,' he discerns as it truly is;
'This is the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|,' he discerns as it truly is;
'This is the |way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|,' he discerns as it truly is.

Cultivate collectedness, bhikkhus. A bhikkhu who is collected discerns as it truly is.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to |fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
