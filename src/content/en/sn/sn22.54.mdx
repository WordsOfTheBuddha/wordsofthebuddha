title: Bīja sutta - Seed
description: The Buddha likens consciousness to a seed which is propagated by a sprinkling of delight. So long as passion for forms, felt experience, perception, and intentional constructs persists, consciousness takes root and grows. When delight in these ceases, its support ends; consciousness becomes unestablished and liberated—stable, content, and unshaken—having reached final Nibbāna.

At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of seeds. What five? The root-propagated seed, the stem-propagated seed, the cutting-propagated seed, the joint-propagated seed, and the seed-propagated seed as the fifth.

Bhikkhus, suppose these five kinds of seeds were unbroken, unspoiled, undamaged by wind or heat, fertile, securely planted. Yet if there were no earth and no water, would these five kinds of seeds grow, sprout, and reach maturity?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Bhikkhus, suppose these five kinds of seeds were unbroken, unspoiled, undamaged by wind or heat, fertile, securely planted, and there were earth and water. Would these five kinds of seeds grow, sprout, and reach maturity?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Bhikkhus, the four |planes of consciousness::stations of consciousness [viññāṇaṭṭhiti]| should be seen as like the |earth element::whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]|. |Delight and passion::pleasure and desire [nandirāga]| should be seen as like the |water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|. Consciousness together |with its nutriment::with its fuel [sāhāra]| should be seen as like the five kinds of seeds.

Consciousness, bhikkhus, while |persisting::remaining [tiṭṭhamāna]|, might persist |attached to form::attracted to form, engaged with materiality [rūpupaya]|, based on [the field of] form, with |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| as a support—and there, with a sprinkling of |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]|—it comes to growth, increase, and full maturation.

Consciousness, bhikkhus, while persisting, might persist attached to |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, based on [the field of] felt experience, with felt experience as a support—and there, with a sprinkling of delight—it comes to growth, increase, and full maturation.

Consciousness, bhikkhus, while persisting, might persist attached to |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks things by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, based on [the field of] perception, with perception as a support—and there, with a sprinkling of delight—it comes to growth, increase, and full maturation.

Consciousness, bhikkhus, while persisting, might persist attached to |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, choices; mental and bodily volitional activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); kamma-producing processes [saṅkhāra]|, based on [the field of] intentional constructs, with intentional constructs as a support—and there, with a sprinkling of delight—it comes to growth, increase, and full maturation.

If anyone, bhikkhus, were to speak thus: ‘Apart from form, apart from felt experience, apart from perception, apart from intentional constructs, I will point out the |coming::descent, incoming trajectory [āgati]|, the |trajectory::going, passing on, path, course, destination [gati]|, the |passing away::falling away, death [cuti]|, the |rebirth::re-arising, reappearance [upapatti]|, the growth, the increase, or the full maturation of consciousness’ — that is not possible.

When for a bhikkhu, |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]| for the |form element::field of material phenomena, including the four great elements (earth, water, fire, air) and forms derived from them; the visible and tangible basis of sensory experience [rūpadhātu]| is abandoned, with the abandoning of passion, the support for the establishment of consciousness is completely cut off.

When for a bhikkhu, passion for the |feeling element::field of felt experiences, including pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling-tones [vedanādhātu]| is abandoned, with the abandoning of passion, the support for the establishment of consciousness is completely cut off.

When for a bhikkhu, passion for the |perception element::field of cognitive recognition, including the discernment of signs, features, and patterns; the faculty that marks and identifies experiences as “this” or “that” [saññādhātu]| is abandoned, with the abandoning of passion, the support for the establishment of consciousness is completely cut off.

When for a bhikkhu, passion for the |element of intentional constructs::field of intentions, decisions, choices, volitional activities, and other intentional constructs that shape experience and produce kamma [saṅkhāradhātu]| is abandoned, with the abandoning of passion, the support for the establishment of consciousness is completely cut off.

Bhikkhus, when for a bhikkhu, passion for the |consciousness element::field of awareness and sentience, including the knowing of an object through the six sense domains—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind [viññāṇadhātu]| is abandoned, with the abandoning of passion, the support for the establishment of consciousness is completely cut off. That consciousness, being unestablished, does not grow, and by |not intentionally constructing::not producing dark or bright kamma [anabhisaṅkhacca]|, is liberated.

By being liberated, there is stability; being stable, there is contentment; being content, there is |no perturbation::no agitation, no mental uneasiness [aparitassa]|. Unperturbed, one personally attains final Nibbāna.

One understands: ‘Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.’”
