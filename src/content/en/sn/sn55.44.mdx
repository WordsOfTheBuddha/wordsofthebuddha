“Bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones endowed with four qualities is called ‘wealthy, of great wealth, of great possessions.’ What four? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with |perfect clarity::unshakable confidence that arises through direct experience, by personally seeing the benefits in one’s own practice [aveccappasāda]| in the Buddha — The Blessed One is an |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|, a perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, a teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One.

Further again, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with perfect clarity in the teachings of the Buddha — Indeed, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, |onward leading::applicable, relevant, practical [opaneyyika]|, to be personally experienced by the wise.

Further again, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with perfect clarity in the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| — Indeed, the community of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this community of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.

Further again, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones—unbroken, untorn, not spotty, unblemished, freeing, praised by the wise, irreproachable, |leading to collectedness::leading to samadhi, conducive to mental composure [samādhisaṃvattanika]|.

Indeed, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones endowed with these four qualities is called ‘wealthy, of great wealth, of great possessions.’"
