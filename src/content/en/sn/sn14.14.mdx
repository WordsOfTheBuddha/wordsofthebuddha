At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, beings come together and associate |according to disposition::in line with their mental qualities or inclinations [dhātuso]|. Those with an |inferior disposition::with bad inclination, with low tendencies [hīnādhimuttika]| come together and associate with others of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a |good disposition::whose inclinations are good, intent is good [kalyāṇādhimuttika]| come together and associate with others of a similar good disposition.

In the past too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition came together and associated with others of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a good disposition came together and associated with others of a similar good disposition.

In the future too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition will come together and associate with others of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a good disposition will come together and associate with others of a similar good disposition.

At present too, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition come together and associate with others of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a good disposition come together and associate with others of a similar good disposition.”
