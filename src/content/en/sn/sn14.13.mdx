At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Ñātika::also known as Nātika or Nādika. It was a town in the Vajjī region, located between Vesālī and Koṭigāma|, at the Brick House. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, |dependent on::contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]| the |element::one of the eighteen components of perceptual experience, corresponding to the six sense organs, their associated external field and corresponding consciousness [dhātu]|, there arises a |perception::conception, a notion, a recognition [saññā]|, there arises a |view::belief, an opinion, a concept, a theory [diṭṭhi]|, there arises a |thought::a train of thought, a reflection, thinking [vitakka]|.”

When this was said, the venerable Kaccāna addressed the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, regarding those who are not fully awakened Buddhas, the view arises, ‘These are in fact fully awakened Buddhas.’ Dependent on what, venerable sir, |does this view arise::can this view be discerned [diṭṭhi + paññāyati]|?”

“Mighty, Kaccāna, is this element, namely the element of |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|. Dependent on an |inferior::low, deficient [hīna]| element, Kaccāna, there arises an inferior perception, an inferior view, an inferior thought, an inferior |intention::will [cetanā]|, an inferior |wish::a prayer, a longing [patthanā]|, an inferior |aspiration::a determination [paṇidhi]|, an inferior person, and an inferior speech. One explains, teaches, presents, establishes, reveals, analyzes, and clarifies what is inferior. His |rebirth::re-arising, reappearance [upapatti]|, I say, is inferior.

Dependent on a middling element, there arises a middling perception, a middling view, a middling thought, a middling intention, a middling wish, a middling aspiration, a middling person, and a middling speech. One explains, teaches, presents, establishes, reveals, analyzes, and clarifies what is middling. His rebirth, I say, is middling.

Dependent on a superior element, there arises a superior perception, a superior view, a superior thought, a superior intention, a superior wish, a superior aspiration, a superior person, and a superior speech. One explains, teaches, presents, establishes, reveals, analyzes, and clarifies what is superior. His rebirth, I say, is superior.”
