title: Nālanda sutta - At Nālandā
description: Sāriputta boldly declares that no ascetic or brahmin has ever been, nor will ever be, more knowledgeable in directly knowing than the Blessed One in full awakening. He acknowledges that he cannot encompass the minds of all the Buddhas, past, future, or present. However, he understands a principle through the Dhamma - all those who become fully awakened do so by abandoning the five hindrances, establishing their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness, and developing the seven factors of awakening.

One time the Blessed One was dwelling at |Nālanda::name of a town near Rājagaha [nāḷandā]| in Pāvārika’s mango grove. Then the venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid respects, and sat down to one side. Sitting there, the venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin more superior in directly knowing than the Blessed One in full awakening.”

“Truly remarkable, Sāriputta! You have spoken exalted speech, declared an absolute truth, and roared a lion’s roar: ‘Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin who is superior in directly knowing than the Blessed One in full awakening.’

What about those who were fully awakened ones in past times, Sāriputta? Did you know all those blessed ones by encompassing their minds with your mind: ‘Such was their virtue, such was their teaching, such was their wisdom, such was their conduct, such was their liberation’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“What about those who will be fully awakened ones in future times, Sāriputta? Will you know all those blessed ones by encompassing their minds with your mind: ‘Such will be their virtue, such will be their teaching, such will be their wisdom, such will be their conduct, such will be their liberation’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“What about me, Sāriputta, now, the fully awakened one? Am I known to you by having encompassed my mind with your mind: ‘Such is my virtue, such is my teaching, such is my wisdom, such is my conduct, such is my liberation’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“And in this case, Sāriputta, regarding the past, future, and present fully awakened ones, you have no mental knowledge. Then what about the exalted speech that has been spoken, the absolute truth that has been taken, the lion’s roar that has been uttered: ‘Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin superior in directly knowing to the Blessed One in full awakening’?”

“No, venerable sir, I have no mental knowledge regarding the past, future, and present fully awakened ones, but I have discerned the principle through the Dhamma. Just as, venerable sir, in a border city of the king, well fortified with strong walls and gates, with one gate, there the gatekeeper is wise, competent, and intelligent. He prevents strangers and admits acquaintances. Walking around the city, he does not see any gap or opening in the wall, not even a hole for a cat to get through. He thinks: ‘Whatever large creatures enter or exit this city, all of them do so through this gate.’”

“Just so, venerable sir, it is known to me by the principle: ‘Those who were fully awakened ones in the past, all those blessed ones, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. Those who will be fully awakened ones in the future, all those blessed ones, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, will fully awaken to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. The Blessed One also, now, the fully awakened one, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with mind well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, has fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.’”

“Excellent, excellent, Sāriputta. Therefore, you should frequently speak this teaching to the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, laymen, and laywomen. For, Sāriputta, if there are any misguided persons who have doubts or uncertainties about the Tathāgata, upon hearing this discourse, their doubts and uncertainties about the Tathāgata will be dispelled.”
