"Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit, outflows of good, and supports for ease. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha — Indeed, the Blessed One is the Worthy One, perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in wisdom and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One. This is the first stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the teachings of the Buddha — Indeed, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, |onward leading::applicable, relevant, practical [opaneyyika]|, to be personally experienced by the wise. This is the second stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the Saṅgha — The community of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this community of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. This is the third stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones lives at home with a mind free from the stain of stinginess, generous, open-handed, enjoying relinquishment, responsive to requests, and joyful in sharing gifts. This is the fourth stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

These indeed, bhikkhus, are the four streams of merit, outflows of good, and supports for ease."
