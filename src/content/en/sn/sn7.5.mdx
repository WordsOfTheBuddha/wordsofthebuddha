At Sāvatthi.

Then, the Brahmin |Ahiṁsaka::harmless, humane [ahiṁsaka]| |Bhāradvāja::name of a lineage of Brahmins [bhāradvāja]| approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.

After the exchange of courteous and polite conversation, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Brahmin Ahiṁsaka Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: "I am harmless, venerable Gotama, I am harmless, venerable Gotama."

If one were as one's name suggests,
surely you would be harmless;
But one who does no |harm::hurt, injure, kill, destroy [hiṁsati]| by body,
by speech or by mind;
That one is truly harmless,
who injures no other at all.

When this was said, the brahmin Ahiṁsaka Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable Gotama! Excellent, venerable Gotama! Just as if one might set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way, venerable Gotama, the Dhamma has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by you in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. May I receive the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One Gotama, may I receive the full ordination."

The brahmin Ahiṁsaka Bhāradvāja received the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One, he received the full ordination. Having recently received full ordination, the venerable Ahiṁsaka Bhāradvāja, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, with continuous effort, and resolutely, soon realized with direct knowledge, in this very life, the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life, for the purpose of which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life to the homeless life, and having personally attained it, he dwelled in it.

He understood: "Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being." And the venerable Ahiṁsaka Bhāradvāja became one among the |arahants::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|.
