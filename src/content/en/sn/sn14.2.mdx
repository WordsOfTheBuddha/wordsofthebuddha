At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), there arises a diversity of contacts.

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises the diversity of contacts?

Dependent on the objects of vision, there arises a \{contact with the eye} (visual impression, visual experience [cakkhusamphassa]).
Dependent on sounds, there arises a \{contact with the ear} (auditory impression, sonic experience [sotasamphassa]).
Dependent on smells, there arises a \{contact with the nose} (olfactory impression, nasal experience [ghanasamphassa]).
Dependent on tastes, there arises a \{contact with the tongue} (gustatory impression, taste experience [jivhāsamphassa]).
Dependent on physical sensations, there arises a \{physical contact} (tactile impression, somatic experience [kāyasamphassa]).
Dependent on mental objects, there arises a \{contact with the mind} (mental impression, cognitive experience [manasamphassa]).

Thus, bhikkhus, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts."
