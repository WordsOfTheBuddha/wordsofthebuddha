“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the |wrong way of practice::wrong path of action [micchāpaṭipadā]| and the |right way of practice::right path of action [sammāpaṭipadā]|. Listen to it.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wrong way of practice? It is: |wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|, |wrong intention::wrong notion, wrong idea [micchāsaṅkappa]|, |wrong speech::speech that is false, divisive, harsh, or frivolous; communication rooted in deceit, hostility, or heedlessness [micchāvācā]|, |wrong action::bodily conduct that causes harm—acts of killing, stealing, or sexual misconduct; behavior contrary to harmlessness and restraint [micchākammanta]|, |wrong livelihood::earning a living or seeking support through deceitful or manipulative means—by cheating, flattery, hinting, disparaging others, or scheming for gain [micchāājīva]|, |wrong effort::energy directed toward unwholesome aims; striving that strengthens greed, hatred, and delusion [micchāvāyāma]|, |wrong mindfulness::imperfect memory, misinformed recollection that reinforces delusion or distraction [micchāsati]|, and |wrong collectedness::wrong concentration that can cause harm to oneself, destabilize the mind, or lead to furthering of delusion [micchāsamādhi]|. This is called, bhikkhus, the wrong way of practice.

And what, bhikkhus, is the right way of practice? It is: |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is purified by abstaining from falsehood, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::perfect memory of the Dhamma; correct recollection of the exact instructions to guide one's practice [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::correct mental composure that stabilizes the mind and supports clarity of thoughts [sammāsamādhi]|. This is called, bhikkhus, the right way of practice.”
