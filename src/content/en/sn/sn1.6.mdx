commentary: |
    When the deity asks how many are asleep among those awake and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the five lower fetters of personal existence, doubt, adherence to rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill-will. These fetters keep one "asleep" even in the presence of wisdom.

    When the deity asks how many are awake among those asleep and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the five spiritual faculties of confidence (faith), energy, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. These faculties keep one "awake" and mindful even in the midst of ignorance.

    When the deity asks by how many is the dust stirred up and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the five hindrances of sensual desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt. These hindrances cloud the mind with impurities.

    When the deity asks by how many is it purified and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the same five spiritual faculties — confidence, energy, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. These faculties purify the mind, leading to clarity and liberation.

At Sāvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"How many are asleep among those awake,
How many are awake among those asleep;
By how many is the dust stirred up,
And by how many is it purified?"

[The Blessed One]: "Five are asleep among those awake,
Five are awake among those asleep;
By five is the dust stirred up,
And by five is it purified."
