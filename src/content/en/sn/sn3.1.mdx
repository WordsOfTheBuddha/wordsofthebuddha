Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

Then, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, and having approached, exchanged greetings with him. After the exchange of courteous and polite conversation, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: “Does sir Gotama also claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed |perfect awakening::full enlightenment [sammāsambodhi]|?”

“If, great king, one speaking rightly could say of anyone, ‘He has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening,’ it is of me that one might rightly say this. For I, great king, have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening.”

“Venerable Gotama, even those ascetics and brahmins who are leaders of communities, heads of groups, renowned, famous, founders of sects, honored by the multitudes—namely Purāṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala—when I questioned them, ‘Do you claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening?’ they did not claim such a thing. How can then sir Gotama, who is young in years and recently gone forth make such a claim?”

“There are four things, great king, that should not be looked down on and disrespected because of youth. What four? 1.) A |prince::a king’s son, of ruling caste [khattiya]|, great king, should not be looked down on and disrespected because of his youth. 2.) A serpent, great king, should not be looked down on and disrespected because of his youth. 3.) A fire, great king, should not be looked down on and disrespected because of its youth. 4.) A bhikkhu, great king, should not be looked down on and disrespected because of his youth. These are the four things that should not be looked down on and disrespected because of youth.”

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Accomplished One further said this:

“A prince of noble birth,
of noble descent, renowned;
He should not be looked down on for his youth,
nor should one |show him disdain::disparage him, insult him, slight him [paribhava]|.

For it may well happen that this prince,
the lord of men, obtains |kingship::dominion, power [rajja]|;
And in his anger deals out harsh punishment,
as royal retribution;
Therefore, one should keep away from him,
looking after one’s own life.

In the village or the wild,
wherever a serpent is seen;
He should not be looked down on for his youth,
nor should one show him disdain.

For as that fierce snake glides along,
manifesting in diverse shapes;
He may attack and bite the fool,
whether a man or a woman;
Therefore one should keep away from him,
looking after one’s own life.

A blazing fire that feeds on everything,
a fierce flame that leaves a blackened trail;
It should not be looked down on for its youth,
nor should one show it disdain.

For once it has found its fuel,
the fire grows vast and fierce;
And striking, it may burn the fool,
whether a man or a woman;
Therefore one should keep away from it,
looking after one’s own life.

When fire consumes a forest,
a conflagration with a blackened trail;
Yet there, new shoots spring forth again,
as the days and nights pass by.

But if a bhikkhu |accomplished in virtue::of excellent morality; accomplished in virtue [sīlasampanna]|,
|burns one with [his virtue’s] fire::Bhikkhu Bodhi's commentary on this notes that the grim consequences of despising and disparaging a virtuous bhikkhu do not come to pass because he harbours vindictive intentions, but as natural fruits of the offensive deeds. Spk explains that a bhikkhu who retaliates when provoked is incapable of harming anyone with “(his virtue’s) fire” (tejasā); the transgressor is burned only when the bhikkhu bears up patiently. In this respect the bhikkhu contrasts with the archetypal Indian figure of the maligned holy man who deliberately inflicts a curse on his enemies. [ḍahati + tejasā]|;
One does not gain sons and offspring,
nor do one’s heirs acquire wealth;
Childless and without heirs,
one becomes like an uprooted palm stump.

Therefore, a person who is |wise::astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]|,
considering one’s own good;
Should treat these properly:
A serpent, a fire,
a renowned prince,
and a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue.”

When this was said, the king Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as if one were to set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms — even so, venerable sir, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by the Blessed One in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life.”
