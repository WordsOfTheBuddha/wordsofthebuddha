“Bhikkhus, just as dawn precedes and predicts the rising of the sun, so too does accomplishment in |wise attention::proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yoniso + manasikāra]| precede and predict the arising of the seven factors of awakening for a bhikkhu. For a bhikkhu accomplished in wise attention and careful attending, it is to be expected that he will cultivate and frequently practice the seven factors of awakening.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu accomplished in wise attention cultivate and frequently practice the seven factors of awakening? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]|, which is |supported by seclusion::dependent on detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|<collapse>, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, and |culminating in complete relinquishment::ripens in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|. He cultivates the |awakening factor of investigation of states::the quality of discriminative investigation into states, mental qualities and other phenomena; analyzing the teaching as a factor of enlightenment; second of the seven awakening factors [dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of energy::the quality of unrelenting effort, the sustaining power of persistence as a factor of enlightenment; third of the seven awakening factors [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of joy::the quality of heartfelt gladness, spiritual rapture untainted by sensuality, as a factor of enlightenment; fourth of the seven awakening factors [pītisambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]|, the |awakening factor of collectedness::the quality of unification, stability, and deep stillness of the mind, as a factor of enlightenment; sixth of the seven awakening factors [samādhisambojjhaṅga]|,</collapse> and the |awakening factor of equanimity::the quality of balanced observation, non-reactivity, and mental equipoise as a factor of enlightenment; seventh of the seven awakening factors [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminating in complete relinquishment. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu accomplished in wise attention cultivates and frequently practices the seven factors of awakening.”
