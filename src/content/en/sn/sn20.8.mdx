Thus have I heard—At At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Vesālī (capital of the Licchavīs [vesālī]) in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked roof. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"

"Venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, at present, the Licchavīs (the Licchavīs were a republican clan of Vesālī, known for their unity and democratic governance. The Buddha often praised their diligence, using them as a model of collective strength, while warning against complacency [licchavī]) dwell using wooden pillows, diligent (doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]) and \{with continuous effort} (ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]) in their training. Therefore, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Videhi, finds no opportunity or foothold. But in the future, bhikkhus, the Licchavīs will delicate, with soft and tender hands and feet. They will sleep until sunrise on soft beds with cotton pillows. At that time, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Videhi, will find an opportunity and a foothold.

Bhikkhus, at present, the bhikkhus dwell using wooden pillows, diligent and with continuous effort in their striving (making effort, exerting [padhāna]). Therefore, Māra the \{Evil One} (epithet of Māra, embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [pāpimant]) finds no opportunity or foothold. But in the future, there will be bhikkhus who are delicate, with soft and tender hands and feet. They will sleep until sunrise on soft beds with cotton pillows. At that time, Māra the Evil One will find an opportunity and a foothold.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell using wooden pillows, diligent and with continuous effort in our striving.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
