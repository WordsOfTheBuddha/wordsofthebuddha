[A deity asked]: “What gives rise to a person?
What does he have that |wanders about::roams around, runs astray [vidhāvati]|?
What |experiences cyclic existence::experiences wandering on, suffers passing from one state of existence to the next [saṃsāramāpādi]|?
From what is he not yet freed?”

[The Blessed One]: “|Craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| gives rise to a person,
his |mind::the faculty of thought and intention, often restless or wandering [citta]| is what wanders about;
A |sentient being::living being; what is clung to, stuck to, attached to [satta]| experiences cyclic existence,
he is not yet freed from |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”
