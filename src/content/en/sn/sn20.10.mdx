At Sāvatthi.

At that time, a certain bhikkhu was engaging with families excessively.

The other bhikkhus said to him: "Venerable, do not engage with families excessively."

But even when spoken to by the other bhikkhus, he did not desist from this.

Then several bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, after approaching and paying homage to the Blessed One, they sat down to one side. Once seated, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: "Here, venerable sir, a certain bhikkhu is engaging with families excessively. The bhikkhus said this to him: 'Venerable, do not engage with families excessively.' But even when spoken to by the other bhikkhus, he does not desist from this."

"Bhikkhus, once in the past a cat stood near a rubbish heap at a crossroads, watching for a young mouse, thinking: 'When this young mouse comes out for food, right there I will grab it and eat it.' Then that mouse came out for food, and the cat grabbed it and swallowed it hastily, without chewing it. Then that young mouse ate the cat's intestines and |mesentery::intestine string [antaguṇa]|, and on that account the cat met with death or deadly suffering.

So too, bhikkhus, here some bhikkhu dresses in the morning and, taking alms bowl and outer robe, enters a village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind |unguarded::unprotected [arakkhita]|, without setting up |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]|, |unrestrained::uncontrolled [asaṃvuta]| in his sense faculties. There he sees a woman who is scantily clothed or improperly covered, and on seeing her, lust invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he meets death or deadly suffering.

For this, bhikkhus, is death in the Noble One's |discipline::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|: that one gives up the training and |reverts back to the household life::returns to lay-life, secular world [hīnāyāvattati]|. This is deadly suffering: that one commits a certain |defiled::tainted, corrupted [saṅkiliṭṭha]| offense of a kind that allows for rehabilitation.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will enter a village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind guarded, with mindfulness set up, restrained in our sense faculties.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
