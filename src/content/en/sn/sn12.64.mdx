At Sāvatthi.

“There are these four |nutriments::fuels, nourishments, sustenance [āhārā]|, bhikkhus, for the |endurance::continuity, longevity [ṭhitiyā]| of beings that are existing and for the support of those seeking birth. What four? Edible food, whether coarse or fine; second, |contact::sense impingement, raw experience, touch [phassa]|; third, |mental intention::mental volition, mental will [manosañcetanā]|; and fourth, |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]|. These are the four nutriments for the endurance of beings that are existing and for the support of those seeking birth.

If, bhikkhus, there is |lust::passion, infatuation, desire [rāga]| for the nutriment edible food, if there is |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]|, if there is |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|, consciousness becomes established there and comes to growth. Wherever consciousness becomes established and comes to growth, there is |an appearance of::a descent of; lit. going down [avakkanti]| |name and form::mentality and materiality—the integrated structure of mental capacities (intention, attention, contact, feeling, perception) and physical form that together constitute and sustain an individual being [nāmarūpa]|. Wherever there is an appearance of name and form, there is the growth of |intentional constructs::the constructive activity that shapes each moment of experience, expressed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations; the accumulated conditioning — patterns, tendencies, and habits — produced by prior action [saṅkhāra]|. Wherever there is the growth of intentional constructs, there is the production of future renewed existence. Wherever there is the production of future renewed existence, there is future birth, aging, and death. Wherever there is future birth, aging, and death, I say that is accompanied by sorrow, anguish, and despair.

If, bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment contact, if there is delight, if there is craving … if there is lust for the nutriment mental intention … if there is lust for the nutriment consciousness, if there is delight, if there is craving, consciousness becomes established there and comes to growth. Wherever consciousness becomes established and comes to growth, there is an appearance of name and form. Wherever there is an appearance of name and form, there is the growth of intentional constructs. Wherever there is the growth of intentional constructs, there is the production of future renewed existence. Wherever there is the production of future renewed existence, there is future birth, aging, and death. Wherever there is future birth, aging, and death, I say that is accompanied by sorrow, anguish, and despair.

Suppose, bhikkhus, an artist or a painter, using dye or lac or turmeric or indigo or crimson, would create a feminine form or a masculine form, complete in all its parts, on a well-polished plank, or a wall, or a canvas.

So too, bhikkhus, if there is lust for the nutriment edible food, if there is delight, if there is craving, consciousness becomes established there and comes to growth. Wherever consciousness becomes established and comes to growth, there is an appearance of name and form. Wherever there is an appearance of name and form, there is the growth of intentional constructs. Wherever there is the growth of intentional constructs, there is the production of future renewed existence. Wherever there is the production of future renewed existence, there is future birth, aging, and death. Wherever there is future birth, aging, and death, I say that is accompanied by sorrow, anguish, and despair.

If, bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment contact … for the nutriment mental intention … for the nutriment consciousness, if there is delight, if there is craving, consciousness becomes established there and comes to growth. Wherever consciousness becomes established and comes to growth, there is an appearance of name and form. Wherever there is an appearance of name and form, there is the growth of intentional constructs. Wherever there is the growth of intentional constructs, there is the production of future renewed existence. Wherever there is the production of future renewed existence, there is future birth, aging, and death. Wherever there is future birth, aging, and death, I say that is accompanied by sorrow, anguish, and despair.

If, bhikkhus, there is no lust for the nutriment edible food, if there is no delight, if there is no craving, consciousness does not become established there and does not come to growth. Wherever consciousness does not become established and does not come to growth, there is no appearance of name and form. Wherever there is no appearance of name and form, there is no growth of intentional constructs. Wherever there is no growth of intentional constructs, there is no production of future renewed existence. Wherever there is no production of future renewed existence, there is no future birth, aging, and death. Wherever there is no future birth, aging, and death, I say that is without sorrow, without anguish, without despair.

If, bhikkhus, there is no lust for the nutriment contact … for the nutriment mental intention … for the nutriment consciousness, if there is no delight, if there is no craving, consciousness does not become established there and does not come to growth. Wherever consciousness does not become established and does not come to growth, there is no appearance of name and form. Wherever there is no appearance of name and form, there is no growth of intentional constructs. Wherever there is no growth of intentional constructs, there is no production of future renewed existence. Wherever there is no production of future renewed existence, there is no future birth, aging, and death. Wherever there is no future birth, aging, and death, I say that is without sorrow, without anguish, without despair.

Suppose, bhikkhus, there is a peaked house or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the north, the south, or the east. When the sun rises and a ray enters through a window, where would it |become established::land, settle [patiṭṭhita]|?”

“On the western wall, venerable sir.”

“If there were no western wall, bhikkhus, where would it become established?”

“On the ground, venerable sir.”

“If there were no ground, bhikkhus, where would it become established?”

“On the water, venerable sir.”

“If there were no water, bhikkhus, where would it become established?”

“It would |not become established::remain unestablished; lit. not stood back [appatiṭṭhita]|, venerable sir.”

“So too, bhikkhus, if there is no lust for the nutriment edible food, if there is no delight, if there is no craving …

If there is no lust for the nutriment contact … for the nutriment mental intention … for the nutriment consciousness, if there is no delight, if there is no craving, consciousness does not become established there and does not come to growth. Wherever consciousness does not become established and does not come to growth, there is no appearance of name and form. Wherever there is no appearance of name and form, there is no growth of intentional constructs. Wherever there is no growth of intentional constructs, there is no production of future renewed existence. Wherever there is no production of future renewed existence, there is no future birth, aging, and death. Wherever there is no future birth, aging, and death, I say that is without sorrow, without anguish, without despair.”
