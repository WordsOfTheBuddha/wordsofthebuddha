At Pāṭaliputta (capital of Magadha, modern Patna).

"'The spiritual life, the spiritual life,' friend Ānanda, it is said. But what, friend, is the spiritual life, and what is the culmination of the spiritual life?"

"Good, good, friend Bhadda. Your approach is good, your intuition is good, and your question is good. For you are asking in this way: 'The spiritual life, the spiritual life,' friend Ānanda, it is said. But what, friend, is the spiritual life, and what is the culmination of the spiritual life?"

"Yes, friend." [venerable Bhadda replied]

"This, friend, is the Noble Eightfold Path, which is the spiritual life. Namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness.

The \{wearing away of desire} (depletion of desire, wearing away of passion [rāgakkhaya]), the \{wearing away of aversion} (wearing away of ill-will, extinction of hatred [dosakkhaya]), the \{wearing away of delusion} (wearing away of illusion, ending of hallucination, ending of misperceptions and distorted views [mohakkhaya]) — this, friend, is the culmination of the spiritual life."
