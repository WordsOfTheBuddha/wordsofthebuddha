At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are vicious.

|With a mind obsessed::mentally obsessed with [pariyādiṇṇacitta]| and |overwhelmed::overcome, overpowered [abhibhūta]| by acquisitions, respect, and popularity, |Devadatta::Devadatta was the Buddha’s cousin and a bhikkhu who, driven by ambition and envy, attempted to create a schism in the Saṅgha. [devadatta]| caused a |schism::split [bhindi]| in the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]|.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.’ Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
