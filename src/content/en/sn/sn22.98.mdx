At Sāvatthi.

Seated to one side, a certain bhikkhu said this to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, does there exist any |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| that is |permanent::stable, not in flux [nicca]|, |enduring::continuous, regular [dhuva]|, |everlasting::eternal [sassata]|, |not subject to change::with unchanging nature [avipariṇāmadhamma]|, that will remain the same forever? Does there exist any |feeling::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, the felt experience, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, any |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks things by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, any |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, and choices expressed as mental, verbal, and bodily activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); processes that produce kamma [saṅkhāra]|, or any |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]| that is permanent, enduring, everlasting, not subject to change, that will remain the same forever?”

“Bhikkhu, there does not exist any form that is permanent, enduring, everlasting, not subject to change, that will remain the same forever. There does not exist any feeling, perception, intentional construct, or consciousness that is permanent, enduring, everlasting, not subject to change, that will remain the same forever.”
