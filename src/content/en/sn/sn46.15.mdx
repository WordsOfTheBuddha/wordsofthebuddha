At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Rājagaha::name of a city; capital of Magadha; lit. king's house [rājagaha]|, in the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time, the venerable |Mahāmoggallāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in psychic power; lit. Moggallāna the great [mahāmoggallāna]| was dwelling on the |Vulture’s peak::name of a mountain peak around Rājagaha; lit. vulture’s peak [gijjhakūṭa]| mountain—sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. Then the Blessed One emerged from |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]| in the late afternoon and went to where the venerable Mahāmoggallāna was. Having approached, he sat down on the prepared seat. Seated, the Blessed One said to the venerable Mahāmoggallāna:

“Is it bearable for you, Moggallāna? Is it manageable for you? Are your painful feelings decreasing, not increasing? Is the subsiding of them, not their intensifying, discernible?”

“Venerable sir, it is not bearable for me, it is not manageable for me. My painful feelings are increasing, not decreasing. Their intensifying, not their subsiding, is discernible.”

“These seven factors of awakening, Moggallāna, have been well taught by me. When cultivated and frequently practiced, they lead to |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, to |full awakening::perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]|, and to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|. What seven? The |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]|, Moggallāna, has been well taught by me; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. <collapse>The |awakening factor of investigation of states::the quality of discriminative investigation into states, mental qualities and other phenomena; analyzing the teaching as a factor of enlightenment; second of the seven awakening factors [dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga]|, Moggallāna, has been well taught by me; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of energy::the quality of unrelenting effort, the sustaining power of persistence as a factor of enlightenment; third of the seven awakening factors [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]|, Moggallāna, has been well taught by me; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of joy::the quality of heartfelt gladness, spiritual rapture untainted by sensuality, as a factor of enlightenment; fourth of the seven awakening factors [pītisambojjhaṅga]|, Moggallāna, has been well taught by me; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]|, Moggallāna, has been well taught by me; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of collectedness::the quality of unification, stability, and deep stillness of the mind, as a factor of enlightenment; sixth of the seven awakening factors [samādhisambojjhaṅga]|, Moggallāna, has been well taught by me; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna.</collapse> The |awakening factor of equanimity::the quality of balanced observation, non-reactivity, and mental equipoise as a factor of enlightenment; seventh of the seven awakening factors [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]|, Moggallāna, has been well taught by me; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. These seven factors of awakening, Moggallāna, have been well taught by me. When cultivated and frequently practiced, they lead to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna.”

“Truly, Blessed One, [these are] the factors of awakening; truly, Fortunate One, [these are] the factors of awakening.”

The Blessed One said this. The venerable Mahāmoggallāna was delighted and pleased with the Blessed One’s words. And the venerable Mahāmoggallāna recovered from that illness. In such a way, the venerable Mahāmoggallāna was cured of his illness.
