Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Rājagaha::name of a city; capital of Magadha; lit. king's house [rājagaha]|, in the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground.

Now at that time, the venerable Vakkali was staying in a potter’s shed, sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill.

Then the venerable Vakkali addressed his attendants: “Come, friends, go to the Blessed One. When you have approached him, bow with your head at the Blessed One’s feet in my name and say: ‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill; he bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet.’ And also say, ‘It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would approach the bhikkhu Vakkali out of |compassion::benevolence, concern, gentle regard [anukampa]|.’”

“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Vakkali. Then they went to the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, they sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill; he bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet. And he also says, ‘It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would approach the bhikkhu Vakkali out of compassion.’” The Blessed One consented in silence.

Then the Blessed One, after putting on his robe and taking his alms bowl and outer robe, went to the venerable Vakkali. The venerable Vakkali saw the Blessed One coming from afar and, seeing him, he |stirred::shook [samadhosi]| on his bed.

Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Vakkali: “Enough, Vakkali, do not stir on your bed. There are these seats made ready; I will sit there.”

The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat. Having sat down, the Blessed One said to the Venerable Vakkali: “Is it bearable for you, Vakkali? Is it manageable for you? Are your painful feelings decreasing, not increasing? Is the subsiding of them, not their intensifying, discernible?”

“Venerable sir, it is not bearable for me, it is not manageable. Strong painful feelings are increasing for me, not subsiding; their increase is discernible, not their subsiding.”

“I hope then, Vakkali, that you have no |remorse::anxiety, restlessness, uneasiness, worry; lit. badly done [kukkucca]| and regret.”

“Venerable sir, I indeed have |great::considerable, not insignificant [anappaka]| remorse and great regret.”

“Do you reproach yourself, Vakkali, regarding |ethical conduct::virtue, moral integrity [sīla]|?”

“No, venerable sir, I do not reproach myself regarding ethical conduct.”

“If you do not reproach yourself regarding ethical conduct, Vakkali, then what is your remorse and what is your regret?”

“For a long time, venerable sir, I have wanted to approach the Blessed One to see him, however, I have not had just this much physical strength to approach the Blessed One to see him.”

“Enough, Vakkali! Why do you want to see this foul body? One who sees the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, Vakkali, sees me; one who sees me, sees the Dhamma. For seeing the Dhamma, Vakkali, one sees me; seeing me, one sees the Dhamma.”

“What do you think, Vakkali? Is |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| |permanent::stable, not in flux [nicca]| or |impermanent::not lasting, transient, unreliable [anicca]|?”

“Impermanent, venerable sir.”

“And that which is impermanent—is it |unsatisfactory::uncomfortable, unpleasant [dukkha]| or |pleasant::comfortable, easy, good [sukha]|?”

“Unsatisfactory, venerable sir.”

“And that which is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and |subject to change::of the nature of alteration, decay [vipariṇāmadhamma]|—is it fitting to regard that as: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Is |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks sensory information by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, |intentional constructs::the constructive activity that shapes each moment of experience, expressed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations; the accumulated conditioning — patterns, tendencies, and habits — produced by prior action [saṅkhāra]|, |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]| permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent, venerable sir.” <collapse>“And that which is impermanent—is it unsatisfactory or pleasant?” “Unsatisfactory, venerable sir.” “And that which is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change—is it fitting to regard that as: ‘This is mine, this I am,</collapse> this is my self’?” “No, venerable sir.”

“Therefore, <collapse>Vakkali, any kind of form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, consciousness, whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, deficient or refined, far or near—all form is to be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Seeing thus, Vakkali, the learned disciple of the Noble Ones becomes disenchanted with form, becomes disenchanted with felt experience, becomes disenchanted with perception, becomes disenchanted with intentional constructs, becomes disenchanted with consciousness. Experiencing disenchantment, they become dispassionate; through dispassion, there is release. When released, there arises the knowledge: ‘Released.’ He</collapse> understands: ‘Birth is ended, the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.’”

Then the Blessed One, having encouraged the venerable Vakkali with this |instruction::advise, encouragement [ovāda]|, rose from his seat and left for |Vulture’s peak::name of a mountain peak around Rājagaha; lit. vulture’s peak [gijjhakūṭa]| mountain.

Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the venerable Vakkali addressed his attendants: “Come, friends, lift me up on the bed and carry me to the |Black Rock::name of an ascetic's haunt on Mount Isigili; lit. black rock [kāḷasilā]| on the |Isigili Slope::side of the Sages' Mountain; mountain near Rājagaha; (comm) swallowing sages [isigilipassa]|. For how could one like me think of dying |in an inhabited area::lit. among the houses [antaraghare]|?”

“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Vakkali. Having lifted the venerable Vakkali onto the bed, they went to the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope. The Blessed One spent the rest of the day and that night on Vulture’s peak mountain.

Then, when the night had advanced, two deities of extraordinary appearance, having illuminated the entire Vulture’s peak, approached the Blessed One and stood to one side.

Standing to one side, one deity said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is intent on |deliverance::release, emancipation, freedom [vimokkha]|.”

The other deity said to the Blessed One: “Surely, venerable sir, he will be liberated as one well liberated.”

This is what those deities said. Having said this, they paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, they vanished right there.

Then, when that night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:

“Come, bhikkhus, go to the bhikkhu Vakkali. Having approached, say this to the bhikkhu Vakkali:

‘Listen, friend Vakkali, to the word of the Blessed One and two deities.

This night, friend, when the night had advanced, two deities of extraordinary appearance, having illuminated the entire Vulture’s peak, approached the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, they stood to one side.

Standing to one side, friend, one deity said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is intent on deliverance.”

The other deity said to the Blessed One: “Surely, venerable sir, he will be liberated as one well liberated.”

And the Blessed One says this to you, friend Vakkali: “Do not fear, Vakkali; do not fear, Vakkali. Your death will not be bad; your dying will not be bad.”’

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. Then they went to the venerable Vakkali. Having approached, they said this to the venerable Vakkali:

“Listen, friend Vakkali, to the word of the Blessed One and two deities.”

Then the venerable Vakkali addressed his attendants: “Come, friends, lower me down from the bed. For how could one like me think of listening to the Blessed One’s message while sitting on a high seat?”

“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Vakkali, and they lowered the venerable Vakkali down from the bed. “This night, friend, when the night had advanced, two deities of extraordinary appearance, having illuminated the entire Vulture’s peak, approached the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, friend, one deity said to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is intent on deliverance.’ The other deity said to the Blessed One: ‘Surely, venerable sir, he will be liberated as one well liberated.’ And the Blessed One says this to you, friend Vakkali: ‘Do not fear, Vakkali; do not fear, Vakkali. Your death will not be bad; your dying will not be bad.’”

“Then, friends, bow with your heads at the Blessed One’s feet in my name and say: ‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. He bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet.’ And say this: ‘Form is impermanent. I do not |doubt::have uncertainty, perplexity, hesitation [kaṅkhati]| this, venerable sir. I have no uncertainty that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory. I have no uncertainty that regarding what is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, I am without |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]|, |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|, or |affection::dearness, fondness [pema]|.

Felt experience is impermanent. I do not doubt this, venerable sir. I have no uncertainty that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory. I have no uncertainty that regarding what is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, I am without desire, passion, or affection.

Perception is impermanent. <collapse>I do not doubt this, venerable sir. I have no uncertainty that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory. I have no uncertainty that regarding what is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, I am without desire, passion, or affection.</collapse>

Intentional constructs are impermanent. I do not doubt this, venerable sir. I have no uncertainty that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory. I have no uncertainty that regarding what is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, I am without desire, passion, or affection.

Consciousness is impermanent. I do not doubt this, venerable sir. I have no uncertainty that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory. I have no uncertainty that regarding what is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, I am without desire, passion, or affection.’”

“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied to the venerable Vakkali and departed. Then, not long after those bhikkhus had left, the venerable Vakkali used the knife.

Then those bhikkhus went to the Blessed One; having approached, they sat down to one side. Seated to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill; he bows his head at the Blessed One’s feet. And he says this: ‘Form is impermanent. I do not doubt this, venerable sir. I have no uncertainty that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory. I have no uncertainty that regarding what is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, I am without desire, passion, or affection. Felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness are impermanent. I do not doubt this, venerable sir. I have no uncertainty that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory. I have no uncertainty that regarding what is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change, I am without desire, passion, or affection.’”

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Come, bhikkhus, let us go to the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope, where the clansman Vakkali has used the knife.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One, together with a number of bhikkhus, went to the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope. The Blessed One saw the venerable Vakkali from afar lying on the bed with his back turned.

Now at that time, a cloud of smoke, a swirl of darkness, was moving to the east, moving to the west, moving to the north, moving to the south, moving upwards, moving downwards, and moving every which way.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Do you see, bhikkhus, that cloud of smoke, that swirl of darkness, moving to the east, <collapse>moving to the west, moving to the north, moving to the south, moving upwards, moving downwards, and</collapse> moving every which way?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“That, bhikkhus, is |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| the |Evil One::profoundly immoral and wicked, having evil quality, epithet of Māra [pāpimant]|, searching for the |consciousness::that dependently arisen knowing which, when rooted in ignorance and supported by intentional constructs, finds a footing and becomes established in a sense realm, a form realm, or a formless realm leading to production of renewed existence in the future [viññāṇa]| of the |clansman::young gentleman, son of a good family [kulaputta]| Vakkali [thinking]: ‘Where has the consciousness of the clansman Vakkali been established?’ But with consciousness |unestablished::not landed; lit. not stood back [appatiṭṭhita]|, bhikkhus, the clansman Vakkali has attained |final Nibbāna::complete cooling, full quenching, total emancipation, dying one’s final death [parinibbuta]|.”
