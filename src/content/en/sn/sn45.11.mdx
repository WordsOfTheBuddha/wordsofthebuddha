title: Paṭhamavihāra sutta - Dwelling (First)
description: Emerging from seclusion, the Buddha describes dwelling in the meditative state he had experienced immediately after Awakening. He explains that all the mental factors—from wrong view to right collectedness, as well as desire, thought, and perception, whether active or subsided—serve as conditions for feeling, even the attainment of the final goal giving rise to feeling.

At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, I wish to go into seclusion for half a month. I should not be approached by anyone, except for the one who brings me alms food.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. And no one approached him, except for the one who brought him alms food.

Then, when that half-month had passed, the Blessed One emerged from |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]| and addressed the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, I have been dwelling in the |meditation attainment::state of mind [vihāra]| in which I dwelt just after I |became fully awakened::attained perfect enlightenment [abhisambuddha]|. I have understood thus: ‘There is feeling with |wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]| as condition, also feeling with |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]| as condition; <collapse>feeling with wrong intention as condition, also feeling with right intention as condition; feeling with wrong speech as condition, also feeling with right speech as condition; feeling with wrong action as condition, also feeling with right action as condition; feeling with wrong livelihood as condition, also feeling with right livelihood as condition; feeling with wrong effort as condition, also feeling with right effort as condition; feeling with wrong mindfulness as condition, also feeling with right mindfulness as condition;</collapse> feeling with |wrong collectedness::wrong concentration that can cause harm to oneself, destabilize the mind, or lead to furthering of delusion [micchāsamādhi]| as condition, also feeling with |right collectedness::correct mental composure that stabilizes the mind and supports clarity of thoughts [sammāsamādhi]| as condition.

There is feeling with |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]| as condition, also feeling with |thought::a train of thought, a reflection, thinking [vitakka]| as condition, and also feeling with |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks sensory information by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]| as condition. When desire has not subsided, thought has not subsided, and perception has not subsided, there is feeling with that as condition. When desire has subsided, thought has subsided, and perception has subsided, there is feeling with that as condition. 

There is |striving::effort, exertion [āyāma]| for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained. When that stage has been reached, there is also feeling with that as condition.’”
