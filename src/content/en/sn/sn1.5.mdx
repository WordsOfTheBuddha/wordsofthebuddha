commentary: |
    When the deity asks how many should one cut off and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five lower fetters of view of personal existence, doubt, adherence to rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill will. One needs to cut these off.

    When the deity asks how many should one abandon and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five higher fetters of desire for fine-material existence, desire for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. One needs to abandon these.
    
    When the deity asks how many should one develop and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five spiritual faculties of |confidence::faith|, energy, mindfulness, |collectedness::concentration|, and wisdom. One needs to develop these.
    
    When the deity asks how many clinging should one overcome and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five clinging aggregates of form, feeling, perception, intentional constructions, and consciousness. One needs to overcome these. When one has overcome these five clinging, one is said to have crossed over the flood of suffering.

At SƒÅvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"How many should one cut off, how many should one abandon,
how many further should one develop;
When a bhikkhu has overcome how many clingings,
is he said to be one who has crossed over the flood?"

[The Blessed One]: "|Five should one cut off::Five lower fetters of view of personal existence, doubt, adherence to rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill will should be cut off.|, |five should one abandon::Five higher fetters of desire for fine-material existence, desire for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance should be abandoned.|,
|five further should one develop::Five spiritual faculties of confidence, energy, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom should be further developed.|;
When a bhikkhu has overcome |five clinging::Clinging at the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, intentional constructions, and consciousness should be overcome.|,
he is said to be one who has crossed over the flood."
