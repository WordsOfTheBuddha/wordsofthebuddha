At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a fisherman casts a baited hook into a deep lake. A fish with an eye for bait swallows it. That fish, having swallowed the fisherman's hook, will meet with misfortune and disaster, and the fisherman could do with it as he wishes.

Bhikkhus, the term 'fisherman' is a designation for Māra the Evil One. The term 'baited hook' is a designation for acquisitions, respect, and popularity. Any bhikkhu who relishes and longs for arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity is called a bhikkhu who has swallowed the hook, who has met with misfortune and disaster, and the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
