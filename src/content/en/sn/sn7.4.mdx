At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground. Then, the brahmin Bilaṅgika Bhāradvāja heard: “It is said that the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan has gone forth from the household life into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama.” Angry and irritated, he approached the Blessed One; having approached, he abused and insulted the Blessed One with |impolite::coarse, rude [asabbha]| and |harsh::rough, unkind [pharusa]| words.

Then the Blessed One, understanding with his mind the thoughts in the mind of the brahmin Bilaṅgika Bhāradvāja, addressed him in verse:

“Whoever |harms::injures, opposes, hates, detests [dussati]| a |blameless::without fault, who is not angry, not upset [appaduṭṭha]| person,
a pure, blemish free individual;
Harm returns [back] to that |immature person::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]|,
like fine dust thrown against the wind.”

When this was said, the brahmin Bilaṅgika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, venerable Gotama! Excellent, venerable Gotama! Just as if one might set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way, venerable Gotama, the Dhamma has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by you in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. May I receive the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One Gotama, may I receive the full ordination.”

The brahmin Bilaṅgika Bhāradvāja received the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One, he received the full ordination. Having recently received full ordination, the venerable Bilaṅgika Bhāradvāja, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, with continuous effort, and resolutely, soon realized with direct knowledge, in this very life, the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life, for the purpose of which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life to the homeless life, and having personally attained it, he dwelled in it.

He understood: “Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.” And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one among the |arahants::fully awakened ones, free from all mental defilements; worthy of offerings and veneration; also an epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|.
