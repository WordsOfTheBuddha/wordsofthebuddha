At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, there are these four elements. What four? The \|earth element::whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]|, the \|water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|, the \|fire element::whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]|, and the \|air element::whatever internal or external that is airy, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [vāyodhātu]|. Bhikkhus, whoever among ascetics or brahmins do not understand, as they truly are, the |arising::appearance, origination [samudaya]| and \|passing away::disappearing, vanishing, subsiding [atthaṅgama]|, the |gratification::satisfaction, pleasure, enjoyment, sweetness [assāda]|, the |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy [ādīnava]|, and the |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| in regard to these four elements—they, bhikkhus, are not recognized by me as ascetics among ascetics or as brahmins among brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones do not, in this very life, \|personally experience::realize for oneself [sacchikatvā]| and attain the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood through \|direct knowing::experiential realization [abhiññā]| and |abiding::dwelling, remaining, staying [viharati]| in it.

"But bhikkhus, whoever among ascetics or brahmins understand, as they truly are, the arising and passing away, the gratification, the drawback, and the escape in regard to these four elements—they, bhikkhus, are recognized by me as ascetics among ascetics and as brahmins among brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones, in this very life, personally experience and attain the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood through direct knowing and abiding in it."
