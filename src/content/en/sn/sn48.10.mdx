“Bhikkhus, these are the five faculties. Which five? The faculty of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|, |energy::willpower, determination [vīriya]|, |mindfulness::memory, remembering, recollection, keeping in mind [sati]|, |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| and |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]|.

And what, bhikkhus, is the |faculty of faith::mental faculty of confidence, conviction, trust [saddhindriya]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones has confidence, is convinced in the awakening of the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|, acknowledging: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, a teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One.’ This is called the faculty of faith.

And what, bhikkhus, is the |faculty of energy::mental faculty of willpower, determination [vīriya]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones keeps his energy aroused for the giving up of unwholesome mental qualities and for the cultivation of wholesome mental qualities. With steadfast determination and unwavering effort, he generates desire, strives, arouses energy, comprehends with his mind, and makes an effort, both to prevent the arising of unarisen harmful unwholesome mental qualities and to abandon existing ones, and to bring forth and develop unarisen wholesome mental qualities and enhance those that have arisen. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of energy.

And what, bhikkhus, is the |faculty of mindfulness::mental faculty of awareness, presence [satindriya]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is fully attentive, equipped with utmost mindfulness, able to recall and reflect upon things done and said long ago. He practices by observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, clearly aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world. Similarly, he applies this practice to |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, mind, and mental qualities, observing them in and of themselves, with continuous effort, clearly aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of mindfulness.

And what, bhikkhus, is the |faculty of collectedness::mental faculty of stability of mind, mental composure [samādhindriya]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones, having made letting go the object, attains |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|, attains |unification [of mind]::one-pointedness, concentration, oneness [ekaggatā]|. Having secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|; 2) with the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|; 3) with the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy, he dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and clearly aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease;' 4) with the abandoning of [bodily] pleasure and |pain::discomfort, unpleasantness. In this context, this is referring to bodily pain or sharp sensations. [dukkha]|, and with the prior settling down of |mental pleasure and displeasure::the duality of positive and negative states of mind; mental happiness and mental pain [somanassadomanassa]|, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of mindfulness through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of collectedness.

And what, bhikkhus, is the |faculty of wisdom::mental faculty of discernment [paññindriya]|? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is wise, endowed with the wisdom which discerns the arising and passing away [of phenomena], a wisdom that is noble and penetrative, and leads directly to the |complete exhaustion of suffering::extinction of stress, termination of tension [dukkhakhaya]|. Such a disciple truly understands, ‘This is suffering’, ‘This is the arising of suffering’, ‘This is the exhaustion of suffering’, and ‘This is the way of practice leading to the exhaustion of suffering’. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of wisdom.

These, bhikkhus, are the five faculties.”
