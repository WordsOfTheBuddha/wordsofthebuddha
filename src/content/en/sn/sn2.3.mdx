At Sāvatthi.

Then, when the night had advanced, the young deity |Māgha::An epithet of Sakka, lord of the deities. In a past human life, he was known as Magha, a virtuous man who performed meritorious deeds, leading to his rebirth as Sakka. [māgha]| , with a radiant appearance, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One, and addressed the Blessed One in verse:

“What should one cut off to sleep with ease?
having slain what one does not |sorrow::grieve [socati]|?
Is there any single thing, |Gotama::family name of the Buddha [gotamā]|,
whose killing you approve of?”

[The Blessed One:] “Cutting off |anger::rage, wrath, fury, indignation [kodha]|, one sleeps with ease,
having slain anger, one sorrows no more;
For anger, with its poisonous root,
and honeyed tip, |Vatrabhū::epithet of Sakka. He is called Vatrabhū because he attained rulership among the deities by overcoming others with his conduct, or because he overcame the asura named Vatra [vatrabhū]|;
The noble ones praise its slaying—
for having cut it off, one grieves no more.”
