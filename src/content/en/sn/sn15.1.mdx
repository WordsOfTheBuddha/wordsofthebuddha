Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, this |cyclic existence::wandering from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]| is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not evident of beings who, obstructed by |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]| and fettered by |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|, run on and wander in this cycle of existence.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to cut up all the grass, sticks, branches, and foliage in this |Jambudīpa::a reference to the Indian subcontinent, lit. land of the black plum aka jambu trees [jambudīpa]|, gather them into one heap, and make them into little pieces, each four finger-breadths in size. He then marks each piece, saying: 'This one is my mother; this one is my mother's mother,' and so on. Even so, bhikkhus, the sequence of that man's mothers would not come to an end before the grass, sticks, branches, and foliage in this Jambudīpa are exhausted.

For what reason? Bhikkhus, this cyclic existence is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not evident of beings who, obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, run on and wander in this cycle of existence. For such a long time, bhikkhus, you have experienced |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, |agony::intense suffering, anguish [tibba]|, and |calamity::disaster [byasana]|, the |cemetery::charnel ground [kaṭasī]| has been filled up with your bones. Therefore, bhikkhus, it is enough |to become disenchanted::to become disillusioned [nibbindituṃ]|, |to become detached::to become dispassionate [virajjituṁ]| and |to become free from::to be liberated from [vimuccituṃ]| |all conditions::all formations, all activities, all fabrications [sabbasaṅkhāra]|.”
