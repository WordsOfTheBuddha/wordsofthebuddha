At Sāvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"There is no |taming::restraint, self-control [dama]| here for one \|fond of conceit::who likes comparing oneself, who is attached to self-praise [mānakāma]|,
nor is there sagehood for the |distracted::with scattered attention, not collected, not well-composed [asamāhita]|;
For one living \|with negligence::inattentively, without care, without carefulness [pamatta]| in the forest,
would not cross beyond the realm of death.

[The Blessed One]: "Having given up conceit, \|completely calm within::thoroughly settled within [susamāhitatta]|,
with a pure mind, released in all respects;
For one living |diligently::attentively, with care, with carefulness, heedfully [pamatta]| in the forest,
would cross beyond the realm of death."
