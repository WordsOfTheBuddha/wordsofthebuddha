At Sāvatthi.

“Form, bhikkhus, is impermanent. What is impermanent is |unsatisfactory::uncomfortable, unpleasant [dukkha]| or |pleasant::comfortable, easy, good [sukha]|; what is unsatisfactory is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as it truly is with correct wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Feeling is impermanent. What is impermanent is unsatisfactory; what is unsatisfactory is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as it truly is with correct wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Perception is impermanent. What is impermanent is unsatisfactory; what is unsatisfactory is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as it truly is with correct wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Formations are impermanent. What is impermanent is unsatisfactory; what is unsatisfactory is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as it truly is with correct wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’
Consciousness is impermanent. What is impermanent is unsatisfactory; what is unsatisfactory is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as it truly is with correct wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Seeing thus, the wise bhikkhu here comprehends: ‘There is no further continuation of this state of being.’”
