At Sāvatthi.

Seated to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said this to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, a reflection arose in my mind: ‘Who truly protects themselves and who leaves themselves unprotected?’

Then, venerable sir, it occurred to me: ‘Those who engage in |bodily misconduct::killing living beings, harming others, theft, or sexual misconduct [kāyaduccarita]|, |verbal misconduct::false speech, harsh speech, divisive speech, idle chatter [vacīduccarita]|, or |mental misconduct::yearning with strong eagerness and desire, having ill will or hatred, delighting in harm [manoduccarita]| leave themselves unprotected. Even though a company of elephant troops may protect them, or a company of cavalry, or a company of chariot troops, or a company of infantry, still they leave themselves unprotected. For what reason? Because that protection is external, not internal; therefore, they leave themselves unprotected.

And those who engage in |good bodily conduct::good physical conduct, virtuous bodily behavior [kāyasucarita]|, |good verabl conduct::applying the five factors of well-spoken speech - 1) speaking at the proper time, 2) being truthful, 3) being gentle, 4) speaking beneficially, and 5) speaking with a mind of loving-kindness [vacīsucarita]|, and |good mental conduct::being with thoughts of renunciation, non-ill will, and non-harm [manosucarita]| protect themselves. Even though no company of elephant troops protects them, nor a company of cavalry, nor a company of charioteers, nor a company of infantry, still they protect themselves. For what reason? Because that protection is internal, not external; therefore, they protect themselves.’”

“So it is, great king, so it is great king. Whoever engages in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, or mental misconduct leaves themselves unprotected. Even though a company of elephant troops may protect them, or a company of cavalry, or a company of chariot troops, or a company of infantry, still they leave themselves unprotected. For what reason? Because that protection is external, not internal; therefore, they leave themselves unprotected. And whoever engages in good bodily conduct, good verabl conduct, or good mental conduct protects themselves. Even though no company of elephant troops protects them, nor a company of cavalry, nor a company of charioteers, nor a company of infantry, still they protect themselves. For what reason? Because that protection is internal, not external; therefore, they protect themselves.

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Accomplished One further said this:

“Restraint with the body is good,
good is restraint by speech;
Restraint with the mind is good,
good is restraint in all aspects;
Restrained in every respect and conscientious,
One is said to be protected.”
