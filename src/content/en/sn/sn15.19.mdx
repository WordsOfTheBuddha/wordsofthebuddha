At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, this \|cyclic existence::wandering from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]| is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]| and fettered by |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|, run on and wander in this cycle of existence. It is not easy, bhikkhus, to find a being who has not been your daughter at some point during this long span of time.

For what reason? Bhikkhus, this cyclic existence is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, run on and wander in this cycle of existence. For such a long time, bhikkhus, you have experienced |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, |agony::intense suffering, anguish [tibba]|, and |calamity::disaster [byasana]|, the |cemetery::charnel ground [kaṭasī]| has been filled up with your bones. Therefore, bhikkhus, it is enough \|to become disenchanted::to become disillusioned [nibbindituṃ]|, \|to become detached::to become dispassionate [virajjituṁ]| and \|to become free from::to be liberated from [vimuccituṃ]| \|all conditions::all formations, all activities, all fabrications [sabbasaṅkhāra]|."
