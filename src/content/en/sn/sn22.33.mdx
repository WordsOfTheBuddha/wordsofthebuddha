At Sāvatthi.

"Whatever, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon [grasping at] it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your |benefit::good, welfare [hitāya]| and |ease::comfort, contentment [sukhāya]|. And what, bhikkhus, is not yours? |Form::physical body and external matter, encompassing both one's body and external objects [rūpa]|, bhikkhus, is not yours; abandon grasping at it. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

|Felt experiences::pleasant, neutral or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| are not yours; abandon grasping at them. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

|Perception::interpretation and recognition of oneself, of things. It can involve concepts, labels, and judgments; third of the five aggregates [sañña]| is not yours; abandon grasping at it. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

|Volitional formations::intentions, choices, decisions, karmic activity; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]| are not yours; abandon grasping at them. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

|Consciousness::quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind]; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]| is not yours; abandon grasping at it. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

Suppose, bhikkhus, whatever grass, wood, branches, and leaves there are in this Jeta's Grove, people might take it away, burn it, or use it as they wish. Would it occur to you thus: 'People are taking us away, burning us, or using us as they wish?'"

"Indeed not, venerable sir."

"For what reason?"

"Because, venerable sir, this is neither our self nor what belongs to our self."

"So too, bhikkhus, form is not yours; abandon grasping at it. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

Felt experiences are not yours; abandon grasping at them. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

Perception is not yours; abandon grasping at it. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

Volitional formations are not yours; abandon grasping at them. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.

Consciousness is not yours; abandon grasping at it. Abandoning it will lead to your benefit and ease.
