“Bhikkhus, there are these seven underlying tendencies. What seven?

1) The underlying tendency toward |sensual desire::passion or lust for sensual pleasures [kāmarāga]|,
2) the underlying tendency toward |aversion::mental resistance, irritation, conflict [paṭigha]|,
3) the |underlying tendency toward views::inherent inclination towards opinions, underlying conceptual beliefs; lit. views sleeping alongside [diṭṭhānusaya]|,
4) the underlying tendency toward |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness wrt suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering [vicikiccha]|,
5) the underlying tendency toward |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|,
6) the underlying tendency toward passion for |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|, and
7) the underlying tendency toward |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|.

These, bhikkhus, are the seven underlying tendencies.

Bhikkhus, for the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these seven underlying tendencies, the four establishments of mindfulness |should be cultivated::should be developed [bhāvetabba]|.”
