“By what is the world held in bondage?
What is its means of locomotion?
By the abandoning of what,
is every bond cut?”

“The world is held in bondage by |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]|,
thought is its means of locomotion;
It is by the abandoning of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇhā]|,
that every bond is cut.”
