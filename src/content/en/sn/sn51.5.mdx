"Bhikkhus, whoever in the past, whether ascetics or brāhmins, have produced |limited psychic power::partial spiritual power, limited supernormal ability [iddhipadesa]|, all of them did so through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic powers. Bhikkhus, whoever in the future, whether ascetics or brāhmins, will produce limited psychic powers, all of them will do so through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic powers. Bhikkhus, whoever at present, whether ascetics or brāhmins, are producing limited psychic powers, all of them are doing so through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic powers.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort.

Bhikkhus, whoever in the past, whether ascetics or brāhmins, have produced limited psychic powers, all of them did so through the development and frequent practice of these very four bases of psychic powers. Bhikkhus, whoever in the future, whether ascetics or brāhmins, will produce limited psychic powers, all of them will do so through the development and frequent practice of these very four bases of psychic powers. Bhikkhus, whoever at present, whether ascetics or brāhmins, are producing limited psychic powers, all of them are doing so through the development and frequent practice of these very four bases of psychic powers."
