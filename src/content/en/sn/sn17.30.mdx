At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, even that bhikkhu who is an arahant, |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|—I say that for him, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are an |obstacle::danger [antarāya]|.”

When this was said, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Why, venerable sir, are acquisitions, respect, and popularity an obstacle even for a bhikkhu whose mental defilements have ended?”

“I do not say, Ānanda, that acquisitions, respect, and popularity are an obstacle to his |unshakeable::unassailable, indisputable [akuppa]| |liberation of mind::emancipated by mind/heart, samādhi obtained from fruition [cetovimutti]|. But I say they are an obstacle to the attainment of those pleasant abidings in this very life, which are reached by one who is |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|,  |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, and |determined::resolute, applying oneself [pahitatta]|.

Thus, Ānanda, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, Ānanda, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.’ Thus, Ānanda, you should train yourselves.”
