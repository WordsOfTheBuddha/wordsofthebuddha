At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the |unconditioned::not created, unconstructed, unformed, epithet of Nibbāna [asaṅkhata]| and the path leading to the unconditioned. Listen to this.

And what, bhikkhus, is the unconditioned? The |wearing away of passion::exhaustion of intense desire, ending of strong emotions, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāgakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of aversion::ending of ill will, extinction of hatred [dosakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of delusion::wearing away of illusion, ending of hallucination, ending of misperceptions and distorted views [mohakkhaya]| — this is called the unconditioned.

And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to the unconditioned? |Mindfulness directed to the body::awareness immersed in the body, dwelling in the body. [kāyagatāsati]| <sup>[1]</sup>. This is called the path leading to the unconditioned.

Thus, bhikkhus, I have taught you the unconditioned and the path leading to the unconditioned. What a teacher should do out of |compassion::concern [anukampa]| for his disciples, seeking their welfare, I have done for you, bhikkhus. Here are these roots of trees, here are these empty huts. |Meditate::contemplate [jhāyati]|, bhikkhus, do not be |negligent::inattentive, careless, intoxicated [pamāda]|; lest you later regret it. This is our instruction to you.”
