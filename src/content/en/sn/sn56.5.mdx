“Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past fully awakened to things as they truly are, all of them fully awakened to the Four Noble Truths as they truly are. Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will fully awaken to things as they truly are, all of them will fully awaken to the Four Noble Truths as they truly are. Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present have fully awakened to things as they truly are, all of them have fully awakened to the Four Noble Truths as they truly are.

What are the four? The Noble Truth of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, the Noble Truth of the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|, the Noble Truth of the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|, the Noble Truth of the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|. Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past fully awakened to things as they truly are, all of them fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as they truly are. Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will fully awaken to things as they truly are, all of them will fully awaken to these Four Noble Truths as they truly are. Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present have fully awakened to things as they truly are, all of them have fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as they truly are.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to |fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: ‘This is suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the arising of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the end of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering.’"
