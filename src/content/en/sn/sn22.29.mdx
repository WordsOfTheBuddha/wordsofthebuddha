At SƒÅvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, whoever delights in form, delights in suffering. I say that one who delights in suffering is not freed from suffering.

Whoever delights in feeling, delights in suffering. Whoever delights in perception, delights in suffering. Whoever delights in formations, delights in suffering. Whoever delights in consciousness, delights in suffering. I say that one who delights in suffering is not freed from suffering.

However, bhikkhus, whoever does not delight in form, does not delight in suffering. I say that one who does not delight in suffering is freed from suffering.

Whoever does not delight in feeling, does not delight in suffering. Whoever does not delight in perception, does not delight in suffering. Whoever does not delight in formations, does not delight in suffering. Whoever does not delight in consciousness, does not delight in suffering. I say that one who does not delight in suffering is freed from suffering."
