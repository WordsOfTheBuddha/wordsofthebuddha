[A deity asked]: “What is a friend to one who is traveling?
What is a friend within the home?
What is a friend in times of need?
What is a friend in the next world?

[The Blessed One]: “A |travel group::caravan, lit. convoy [sattha]| is a friend to one who is traveling,
A mother is a friend within the home;
An ally in times of need,
is a friend again and again;
The |merits::good deeds [puññā]| one has made by oneself—
they are the friend in the next world.”
