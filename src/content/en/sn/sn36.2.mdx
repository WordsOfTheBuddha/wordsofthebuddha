Pleasant felt experience, painful felt experience, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant felt experience. These, bhikkhus, are the three felt experiences.

Whether pleasant or painful,
along with neither-painful-nor-pleasant;
Internally and externally,
whatever there is that is |felt::experienced, sensed [vedita]|:

Having known this as |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,
|deceptive::false, lit. untrue nature [mosadhamma]| [by nature], |disintegrating::falling apart [palokī]|;
Seeing its |vanishing::disappearing, fading away [vaya]| with each contact,
one becomes |dispassionate toward::detached from [virajjati]| it.”
