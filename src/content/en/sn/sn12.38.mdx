At Sāvatthi.

“Whatever one intends, plans, and has an underlying |tendency::attachment, clinging, holding on| towards, bhikkhus, this becomes a basis for the continuation of consciousness. When there is a basis, there is a support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is established and has come to growth, there is the production of renewed existence in the future. When there is the production of renewed existence in the future, there is future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Thus there is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.

If one does not intend, does not plan, but still has an underlying tendency towards, bhikkhus, this becomes a basis for the continuation of consciousness. When there is a basis, there is a support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is established and comes to growth, there is the production of renewed existence in the future. When there is the production of renewed existence in the future, there is future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Thus there is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.

However, bhikkhus, when one neither intends, nor plans, nor has an underlying tendency towards, there is no basis for the continuation of consciousness. With no basis, there is no support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is not established and does not come to growth, there is no production of renewed existence in the future. When there is no production of renewed existence in the future, there is no future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Thus there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.”
