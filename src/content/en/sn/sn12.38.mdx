At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, here, whatever one |intends::wills, thinks about [ceteti]|, what one |plans::designs, imagines [pakappeti]|, and whatever one has a |tendency::attachment, clinging, holding on [anuseti]| towards, bhikkhus, this becomes a basis for the continuity of |consciousness::that dependently arisen knowing which, when rooted in ignorance and supported by intentional constructs, finds a footing and becomes established in a sense realm, a form realm, or a formless realm leading to production of renewed existence in the future [viññāṇa]|. When there is a basis, there is a support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is established and has come to growth, there is the production of renewed existence in the future. When there is the production of renewed existence in the future, there is future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Thus there is the arising of this entire mass of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.

If one does not intend, does not plan, but still has a tendency toward something, bhikkhus, this becomes a basis for the continuity of consciousness. When there is a basis, there is a support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is established and comes to growth, there is the production of renewed existence in the future. When there is the production of renewed existence in the future, there is future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Thus there is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.

However, bhikkhus, when one neither intends, nor plans, nor has a tendency toward anything, there is no basis for the continuation of consciousness. With no basis, there is no support for the continuity of consciousness. When consciousness is not established and does not come to growth, there is no production of renewed existence in the future. When there is no production of renewed existence in the future, there is no future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Thus there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.”
