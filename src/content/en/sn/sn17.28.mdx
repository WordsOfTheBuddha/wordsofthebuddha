At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are vicious.

Bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity cut through the outer skin; having cutting through the outer skin, they cut through the inner skin; having cutting through the inner skin, they cut through the flesh; having cutting through the flesh, they cut through the sinews; having cut through the sinews, they cut through the bones; having cut through the bones, they stand pressing against the bone marrow.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
