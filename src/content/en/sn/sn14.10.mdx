title: Dutiyabāhiraphassanānattasutta - Diversity Of External Contacts <span class="text-sm">(Second)</span>
description: The Buddha describes how the diversity of acquisitions is not the cause for the arising of diversity of fevers, desires, sensations connected with contact, contacts, intentions, perceptions, and elements. Rather, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of perceptions, intentions, contacts, sensations connected with contact, desires, fevers, quests, and acquisitions.

At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), there arises a \{diversity of perceptions} (variety of conceptions, manifold notions [saññānānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises a \{diversity of intentions} (volitions, purposes, thoughts [saṅkappanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of intentions, there arises a \{diversity of contacts} (sense impingements, raw experiences, experiences of coming into contact with [phassanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a \{diversity of sensations} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experiences, feelings, second of the five aggregates [vedanānānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of sensations, there arises a \{diversity of desires} (inclinations, wishes, impulses, interests, goals, objectives, aspirations [chandanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of desires, there arises the \{diversity of fevers} (burning passion, strong desires, fascination, infatuations, attachments, lust [pariḷāhanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of fevers, there arises the \{diversity of quests} (searches, inquiries, pursuits [pariyesanānānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of quests, there arises the \{diversity of acquisitions} (gains, profit, attainments, objects of possession [lābhanānatta]).
Diversity of quests does not arise dependent on the diversity of acquisitions,
diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on the diversity of quests,
diversity of desires does not arise dependent on the diversity of fevers,

diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on the diversity of sensations,
diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts,
diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on the diversity of intentions,
and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of perceptions.

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on diversity of elements, there arises the diversity of perceptions,
that dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises a diversity of intentions,

that diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on the diversity of quests,
that diversity of desires does not arise dependent on the diversity of fevers,
that diversity of sensations does not arise dependent on the diversity of desires,
that diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on the diversity of sensations,
that diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts,
that diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on the diversity of intentions,
and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of perceptions?
