title: Dutiya bāhiraphassanānattasutta - Diversity Of External Contacts (Second)
description: The Buddha describes how the diversity of acquisitions is not the cause for the arising of diversity of fevers, desires, felt experiences connected with contact, contacts, intentions, perceptions, and elements. Rather, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of perceptions, intentions, contacts, felt experiences connected with contact, desires, fevers, quests, and acquisitions.

At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |dependent on::contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]| the |diversity of elements::variety of foundational properties making up experience—earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness; basis for bodily and mental phenomena; multiplicity of conditioned building blocks mistaken for self [dhātunānatta]|, there arises a |diversity of perceptions::variety of conceptions, manifold notions [saññānānatta]|,
dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises a |diversity of intentions::variation in volitional aims and mental resolve; diversity in motivational tendencies, goals, or directed thoughts; multiplicity of intention-patterns shaping behavior [saṅkappanānatta]|,
dependent on the diversity of intentions, there arises a |diversity of contacts::multiplicity of sensory encounters; variety of experiential junctions where sense faculty, object, and consciousness converge; conditioned points of experience giving rise to feeling [phassanānānatta]|,
dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a |diversity of felt experiences::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensations, feelings, second of the five aggregates [vedanānānatta]|,
dependent on the diversity of felt experiences, there arises a |diversity of desires::motivational inclinations, goal-directed drives, wishful tendencies, aspiring interests, aims rooted in either craving or resolve [chandanānatta]|,
dependent on the diversity of desires, there arises the |diversity of fevers::emotional heat of passion and craving; burning impulses, obsessive attachments, infatuations, and restless desire-states [pariḷāhanānatta]|,
dependent on the diversity of fevers, there arises the |diversity of quests::variety in pursuits and searches; multiplicity of aims in seeking satisfaction or meaning—ranging from sensual gratification to liberation [pariyesanānānatta]|,
dependent on the diversity of quests, there arises the |diversity of acquisitions::variety of gains and attainments; forms of possession, advantage, or profit—material, social, or conceptual—sought or clung to as ‘mine’ [lābhanānatta]|.
Diversity of quests does not arise dependent on the diversity of acquisitions,
diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on the diversity of quests,
diversity of desires does not arise dependent on the diversity of fevers,
diversity of felt experiences does not arise dependent on the diversity of desires,
diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on the diversity of felt experiences,
diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts,
diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on the diversity of intentions,
and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of perceptions.

And what is the diversity of elements? The |form element::the elemental basis for visual objects—such as shapes, colors, light, bodily forms, gestures, ornaments, scenery, or textures visible through the eye—anything whose appearance enables seeing and may condition perception, attraction, or craving [rūpadhātu]|, |sound element::the elemental basis for auditory experience—such as tones, voices, musical patterns, shouts, praises, speech, or ambient noise—anything whose vibratory quality enables hearing and can become a basis for perception, emotional response, or craving [saddadhātu]|, |odor element::the elemental basis for smells—such as fragrances, stench, food aromas, floral scents, perfumes, or earthy odors—anything whose scent-bearing nature forms the condition for olfactory experience and may lead to craving or attachment [gandhadhātu]|, |taste element::the elemental basis for gustatory experience—such as sweet, bitter, sour, salty, spicy, or subtle flavor properties that arise in dependence on tongue contact with substances, forming the condition for taste perception and potentially giving rise to craving or attachment [rasadhātu]|, |tangible object element::the elemental basis for touch sensation—such as hardness, softness, warmth, coolness, pressure, movement, or contact with textures and bodies—anything that, when contacted by the body, can give rise to tactile experience and potentially become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]|, and |mental object element::the elemental basis for mental phenomena—such as thoughts, emotions, perceptions, volitions, conceptual constructs, and internal representations—that arise within the mind and form the condition for knowing, imagining, interpreting, or craving [dhammadhātu]|. This is called the diversity of elements.
