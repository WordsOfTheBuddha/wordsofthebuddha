“Bhikkhus, I will teach the noble eightfold path and explain it in detail. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, is the noble eightfold path? It is right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and |right collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure, the four jhānas [samādhi]|.

And what, bhikkhus, is right view? That which, bhikkhus, is |insight::understanding, knowing [ñāṇa]| of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, wisdom of the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|, wisdom of the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|, wisdom of the |way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|—this is called right view, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right intention? That which, bhikkhus, is an |intention rooted in renunciation::thought related to giving up of sensual pleasure [nekkhammasaṅkappa]|, an |intention rooted in non-ill-will::thought related to benevolence, kindliness [abyāpādasaṅkappa]|, and an |intention rooted in not-harming::thought related to non-cruelty [avihiṃsāsaṅkappa]|—this is called right intention, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right speech? That which, bhikkhus, is abstention from |false speech::lying, deliberately speaking falsehood [musāvāda]|, abstention from |divisive speech::defamatory words, slanderous speech, speech intended to create division [pisuṇāya + vācā]|, abstention from |harsh speech::speech that is rough, rude, or unkind [pharusa + vācā]|, abstention from |frivolous chatter::meaningless talk, gossip, idle speech [samphappalāpa]|—this is called right speech, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right action? That which, bhikkhus, is abstention from |killing living beings::taking life, destruction of life [pāṇātipāta]|, abstention from |taking what is not given::theft, stealing, taking what is not offered [adinnādāna]|, abstention from |sexual misconduct::unchastity [abrahmacariya]|—this is called right action, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood? Here, bhikkhus, having abandoned wrong livelihood, a bhikkhu makes his living by right livelihood—this is called right livelihood, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right effort? Here, bhikkhus, 1) a bhikkhu produces |a wholesome motivation::an aspiration, a goal, an interest, an objective [chanda]|, |exerts effort::engages in intentional effort [vāyamati]|, |initiates and sustains energy::the initial spark of motivation and action along with the persistence needed to follow through, even as challenges arise [vīriya + ārabhati]|, |uplifts::befriends and holds it up [paggaṇhāti]| the mind, and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| qualities; 2) he produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |giving up::letting go, abandoning, removing [pahāna]| of arisen harmful and unwholesome qualities; 3) he produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |arising::appearance, coming into being [uppāda]| of unarisen |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| qualities; 4) he produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |stability::establishment, constancy, continuity [ṭhiti]| and |retention::non-confusion and non-decline [asammosa]|, |growth::further development, multiplication [bhiyyobhāva]| and |full development::expansion and maturity [vepulla]| of arisen wholesome qualities.

And what, bhikkhus, is right mindfulness? Here, bhikkhus, 1) a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world; 2) he dwells observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; 3) he dwells observing the mind in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; 4) he dwells observing the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world.

And what, bhikkhus, is right collectedness? Here, bhikkhus, 1) a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born from seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and is |filled with joyful pleasure::imbued with joy and happiness, with delight and ease, sometimes experienced as an intense joy or pleasure, rapture [pītisukha]|. 2) With the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which is characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, is without reflection and examination, |born from collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and is filled with joyful pleasure. 3) With the fading away of joyful pleasure, the bhikkhu dwells in a |state of equanimity::mental poised, mentally balanced, equanimous, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |ease::comfort, contentedness, happiness, pleasure [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ 4) With the abandoning of ease and |discontentment::discomfort, unpleasantness, something unsatisfactory, stress [dukkha]|, and with the settling down of |joy and sorrow::craving and aversion, pleasure and displeasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, gladness and dejection, positive state of mind and negative state of mind [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant.
