“Bhikkhus, I will teach the noble eightfold path and explain it in detail. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, is the noble eightfold path? It is right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and |right collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure, the four jhānas [samādhi]|.

And what, bhikkhus, is right view? That which, bhikkhus, is |insight::understanding, knowing [ñāṇa]| of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, wisdom of the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|, wisdom of the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|, wisdom of the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|—this is called right view, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right intention? That which, bhikkhus, is an |intention rooted in renunciation::thought related to giving up of sensual pleasure [nekkhammasaṅkappa]|, an |intention rooted in non-ill-will::thought related to benevolence, kindliness [abyāpādasaṅkappa]|, and an |intention rooted in not-harming::thought related to non-cruelty [avihiṃsāsaṅkappa]|—this is called right intention, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right speech? That which, bhikkhus, is abstention from |false speech::lying, deliberately speaking falsehood [musāvāda]|, abstention from |divisive speech::defamatory words, slanderous speech, speech intended to create division [pisuṇāya + vācā]|, abstention from |harsh speech::speech that is rough, rude, or unkind [pharusa + vācā]|, abstention from |frivolous chatter::meaningless talk, gossip, idle speech [samphappalāpa]|—this is called right speech, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right action? That which, bhikkhus, is abstention from |killing living beings::taking life, destruction of life [pāṇātipāta]|, abstention from |taking what is not given::theft, stealing, taking what is not offered [adinnādāna]|, abstention from |sexual misconduct::unchastity [abrahmacariya]|—this is called right action, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood? Here, bhikkhus, having abandoned wrong livelihood, a bhikkhu makes his living by right livelihood—this is called right livelihood, bhikkhus.

And what, bhikkhus, is right effort? Here, bhikkhus, 1) a bhikkhu produces |a wholesome motivation::an aspiration, a goal, an interest, an objective [chanda]|, |exerts effort::engages in intentional effort [vāyamati]|, |initiates and sustains energy::the initial spark of motivation and action along with the persistence needed to follow through, even as challenges arise [vīriya + ārabhati]|, |uplifts::befriends and holds it up [paggaṇhāti]| the mind, and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| qualities; 2) he produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |giving up::letting go, abandoning, removing [pahāna]| of arisen harmful and unwholesome qualities; 3) he produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |arising::appearance, coming into being [uppāda]| of unarisen |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| qualities; 4) he produces a wholesome motivation, exerts effort, initiates and sustains energy, uplifts the mind, and strives for the |stability::establishment, constancy, continuity [ṭhiti]| and |retention::non-confusion and non-decline [asammosa]|, |growth::further development, multiplication [bhiyyobhāva]| and |full development::expansion and maturity [vepulla]| of arisen wholesome qualities.

And what, bhikkhus, is right mindfulness? Here, bhikkhus, 1) a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world; 2) he dwells observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; 3) he dwells observing the mind in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world; 4) he dwells observing the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world.

And what, bhikkhus, is right collectedness? Here, bhikkhus, 1) a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| mental states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is |accompanied by reflection::with thinking [savitakka]| and |examination::with investigation, evaluation [savicāra]|, |born of seclusion::secluded from the defilements [vivekaja]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. 2) With the |settling::calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]| of reflection and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, characterized by internal |tranquility::calming, settling, confidence [sampasādana]| and |unification::singleness, integration [ekodibhāva]| of mind, free from reflection and examination, |born of collectedness::born from a stable mind [samādhija]|, and imbued with |uplifting joy and pleasure::delight and ease; sometimes experienced as ecstasy, intense exhilaration or rapture [pītisukha]|. 3) With the |fading of desire for::dispassion toward, detachment from [virāga]| uplifting joy, the bhikkhu dwells |equanimous::mental poised, mentally balanced, non-reactive, disregarding [upekkhaka]|, |mindful and fully aware::attentive and completely comprehending [sata + sampajāna]|, experiencing |pleasure::comfort, contentedness, happiness, ease [sukha]| with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna, which the Noble Ones describe as, ‘one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.’ 4) with the abandoning of [bodily] pleasure and |pain::discomfort, unpleasantness. In this context, this is referring to bodily pain or sharp sensations. [dukkha]|, and with the prior settling down of |mental pleasure and displeasure::the duality of positive and negative states of mind; mental happiness and mental pain [somanassadomanassa]|, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is characterized by purification of |mindfulness::recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| through |equanimity::mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]|, experiencing a feeling which is neither-painful-nor-pleasant.
