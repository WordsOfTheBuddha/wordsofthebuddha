But because there is gratification in the earth element, beings become infatuated with it. If there were no |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| in the earth element, beings would not become |disenchanted with::disillusioned with [nibbindati]| the earth element. But because there is drawback in the earth element, beings become disenchanted with it. If there were no |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| from the earth element, beings would not |escape from::depart from, become free from [nissarati]| it. But because there is an escape from the earth element, beings escape from it.

If there were no gratification in the |water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|, beings would not be infatuated with the water element. But because there is gratification in the water element, beings become infatuated with it. If there were no drawback in the water element, beings would not become disenchanted with the water element. But because there is drawback in the water element, beings become disenchanted with it. If there were no escape from the water element, beings would not escape from it. But because there is an escape from the water element, beings escape from it.

If there were no gratification in the |fire element::whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]|, beings would not be infatuated with the fire element. But because there is gratification in the fire element, beings become infatuated with it. If there were no drawback in the fire element, beings would not become disenchanted with the fire element.

Bhikkhus, as long as beings have not |experientially understood::directly known, realized [abbhaññāsi]|, |as they truly are::as they have come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|, the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape in regard to these four elements, they have not escaped from this world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners; nor are they |disentangled from::disengaged from, detached from [visaṃyutta]| it, nor fully released from it, nor do they dwell with a |boundless mind::unrestricted mind, mind without barriers [vimariyādikata + cetasā]|.

But, bhikkhus, when beings experientially understand, as they truly are, the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape in regard to these four elements, they have escaped from this world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners; they are disentangled from it, fully released from it, and they dwell with a boundless mind."
