But because there is gratification in the earth element, beings become infatuated with it. If there were no |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| in the earth element, beings would not become |disenchanted with::disillusioned with [nibbindati]| the earth element.

But because there is gratification in the fire element, beings become infatuated with it. If there were no drawback in the fire element, beings would not become disenchanted with the fire element.

So long, bhikkhus, as beings have not |experientially understood::directly known, realized [abbhaññāsi]|, |as they truly are::as they have come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|, the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape with regard to these four elements, they have not escaped from this world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion; lit. causing death [mārake]|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners; nor are they |disentangled from::disengaged from, detached from, unfettered from [visaṃyutta]| it, nor fully released from it, nor do they dwell with a |mind rid of barriers::unrestricted mind, boundless mind [vimariyādikata + cetasā]|.

But, bhikkhus, when beings have experientially understood, as they truly are, the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape with regard to these four elements, then, bhikkhus, they have escaped from this world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners; they are disentangled from it, fully released from it, and they dwell with a mind rid of barriers.”
