At Sāvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"Life ebbs away, its span is short,
For one brought to old age, there are no shelters;
Clearly seeing this danger in death,
one should do meritorious deeds that bring happiness.

[The Blessed One]: "Life ebbs away, its span is short,
For one brought to old age, there are no shelters;
Clearly seeing this danger in death,
One should drop |the world's bait::worldliness, material pleasure, worldly pleasure [lokāmisa]|, looking for peace."
