Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park.

Then, when the night had advanced, the young deity |Siva::name of a deity, Shiva, lit. auspicious [siva]|, with a radiant appearance, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:

“One should associate only with the wise,
with the wise, one should foster close associations;
Having understood the good teaching,
One becomes better, never worse.

One should associate only with the good,
with the good, one should foster close associations;
Having understood the good teaching,
|wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]| is gained, but not from another.

One should associate only with the good,
with the good, one should foster close associations;
Having understood the good teaching,
one does not |sorrow::grieve [socati]| in the midst of sorrow.

One should associate only with the good,
with the good, one should foster close associations;
Having understood the good teaching,
one shines amidst one's |relatives::relations, family [ñāti]|.

One should associate only with the good,
with the good, one should foster close associations;
Having understood the good teaching,
being fare on to a |good destination::fortunate condition [sugati]|.

One should associate only with the good,
with the good, one should foster close associations;
Having understood the good teaching,
beings abide in |comfort::pleasure, happiness, delight [sāta]|.

Then the Blessed One replied to the young deva Siva in verse:

“One should associate only with the good,
with the good, one should foster close associations;
Having understood the good teaching,
one is freed from all |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”
