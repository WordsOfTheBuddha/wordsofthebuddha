“What, bhikkhus, is the |spiritual life::ascetic life, monkhood [sāmañña]|? It is this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|. This is called the spiritual life.
