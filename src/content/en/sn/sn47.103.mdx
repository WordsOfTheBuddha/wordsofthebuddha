“Bhikkhus, there are these five lower fetters. What five? 1) |personal existence view::view of having an individual identity, as an embodied being, seeing oneself as the owner of the body and mind [sakkāyadiṭṭhi]|, 2) |doubt::uncertainty, indecisiveness, lack of confidence in the Buddha's teachings [vicikicchā]|, 3) |clinging to rules and observances::clinging to precepts and practices, adherence to rites and rituals [sīlabbataparāmāsa]|, 4) |sensual desire::interest in sensual pleasure, sensual impulse [kāmacchanda]|, and 5) |ill will::hatred, hostility, animosity [byāpāda]|. These are the five lower fetters.

For the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these five lower fetters, the four establishments of mindfulness |should be cultivated::should be developed [bhāvetabbo]|.”
