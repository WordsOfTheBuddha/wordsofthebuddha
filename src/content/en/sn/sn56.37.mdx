"Bhikkhus, just as dawn precedes and predicts the rising of the sun, so too, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu, right view precedes and predicts the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths as they really are.

For that bhikkhu, it is to be expected: 'He will understand, as it really is, this is suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]); he will understand, as it really is, this is the \{arising of suffering} (source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]); he will understand, as it really is, this is the \{ending of suffering} (ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]); he will understand, as it really is, this is the \{way of practice leading to the ending of suffering} (i.e. the noble eightfold path [dukkhanirodhagāmī]).'

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to \{fully understand} (understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate): 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
