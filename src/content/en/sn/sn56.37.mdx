“Bhikkhus, just as dawn precedes and predicts the rising of the sun, so too, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu, right view precedes and predicts the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths as they really are.

For that bhikkhu, it is to be expected: ‘He will understand, as it really is, this is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|; he will understand, as it really is, this is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|; he will understand, as it really is, this is the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|; he will understand, as it really is, this is the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.’

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to |fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: ‘This is suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the arising of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the end of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering.’"
