At Sāvatthi.

Then the |headman::head of the village, chieftain [gāmaṇi]| Caṇḍa approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the headman Caṇḍa said to the Blessed One:

“What, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the supporting condition whereby here a certain person is recognized as |aggressive::fierce, savage, wrathful [caṇḍa]|? And what, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the supporting condition whereby here a certain person is recognized as |gentle::polite, easy-going, calm [sorata]|?”

“Here, headman, a certain person has not abandoned |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|. Because passion is not abandoned in him, he is susceptible to others’ provocation, and |being provoked::being disturbed, upset, lit. being caused to shake [kopiyamāna]| by others, he displays |anger::indignance, wrath, rage, the mental quality of being disturbed, being shaken up [kopa]|, and he is thus recognized as aggressive. He has not abandoned |aversion::hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|. Because aversion is not abandoned in him, he is susceptible to others’ provocation, and being provoked by others, he displays anger, and he is thus recognized as aggressive. He has not abandoned |delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|. Because delusion is not abandoned in him, he is susceptible to others’ provocation, and being provoked by others, he displays anger, and he is thus recognized as aggressive. This, headman, is the cause, this is the supporting condition whereby here a certain person is recognized as aggressive.

Moreover here, headman, a certain person has abandoned passion. Because passion is abandoned in him, he is not susceptible to others’ provocation, and being provoked by others, he does not display anger, and he is thus recognized as gentle. He has abandoned aversion. Because aversion is abandoned in him, he is not susceptible to others’ provocation, and being provoked by others, he does not display anger, and he is thus recognized as gentle. He has abandoned delusion. Because delusion is abandoned in him, he is not susceptible to others’ provocation, and being provoked by others, he does not display anger, and he is thus recognized as gentle.

When this was said, the headman Caṇḍa said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as if one were to set upright what had been overturned, |reveal::uncover [vivarati]| what had been concealed, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms — even so, venerable sir, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| has been |explained::illustrated [pakāsita]| by the Blessed One in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who, from this day forward, has gone to refuge for life.”
