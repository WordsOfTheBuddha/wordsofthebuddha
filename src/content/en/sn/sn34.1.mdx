At S훮vatthi.

"Bhikkhus, there are these four types of meditators. What are the four?

Here, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is skilled in |collectedness::concentration, mental composure, stability of mind| but not skilled in attainment based on collectedness.

Here, however, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is skilled in attainment based on collectedness but not skilled in collectedness.

Here, however, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is neither skilled in collectedness nor skilled in attainment based on collectedness.

Here, however, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is skilled in both collectedness and in attainment based on collectedness.

Among these, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled in both collectedness and in attainment based on collectedness is considered the foremost, the best, the highest, and the most excellent of these four meditators.

Just as, bhikkhus, from milk comes curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes the cream of ghee, which is regarded as the best;

So too, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled in both collectedness and in attainment based on collectedness is the foremost, the best, the highest, and the most excellent of these four meditators."
