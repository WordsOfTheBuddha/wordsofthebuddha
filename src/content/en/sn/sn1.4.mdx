At Sāvatthi.

Standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

“Time flies by, the nights swiftly pass,
The stages of life gradually abandon [us];
Clearly seeing this danger in death,
One should do meritorious deeds that bring happiness.”

[The Blessed One]: “Time flies by, the nights swiftly pass,
The stages of life gradually abandon [us];
Clearly seeing this danger in death,
One should drop the |world’s bait::material delight, worldliness [lokāmisa]|, looking for peace.”
