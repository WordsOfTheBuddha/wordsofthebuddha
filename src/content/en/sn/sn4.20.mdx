At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans in a small forest hut in the Himalayan region.

Then, while the Blessed one was alone in |seclusion::solitude, privacy [paṭisallāna]|, a reflection arose in his mind thus: ”Is it possible to exercise kingship righteously—without killing and without instigating others to kill, without conquering and without instigating others to conquer, without sorrowing and without causing others to sorrow?”

Then |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| the Evil One, having known the reflection in the Blessed One’s mind with his own mind, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he said to the Blessed One: “Let the Blessed One exercise kingship, sir! Let the Accomplished One exercise kingship righteously—without killing and without instigating others to kill, without conquering and without instigating others to conquer, without sorrowing and without causing others to sorrow.”

“But what do you see in me, Evil One, that you speak to me thus: ”Let the Blessed One exercise kingship, sir! Let the Accomplished One exercise kingship righteously—without killing and without instigating others to kill, without conquering and without instigating others to conquer, without sorrowing and without causing others to sorrow?”

“Sir, the Blessed One has developed, practiced often, made a vehicle, made a basis, firmly established, consolidated, and |resolutely undertaken::fully engaged with, energetically taken up [susamāraddha]| the four |bases of psychic power::bases for spiritual power, paths to supernormal abilities [iddhipādā]|. And if he wished, sir, the Blessed One could resolve upon the Himalayas, the king of mountains, to be gold, and it would indeed become gold.”

“If there were a beautiful mountain,
made entirely of solid gold;
Even twofold of that would not be enough for one:
Knowing this, one should |fare evenly::live a balanced life [samañcara]|.

One who has seen the source whence |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| springs,
how could such a person incline toward sensual pleasures?
Having understood |acquisition::attachment, taking as mine, appropriation, sense of ownership, identification [upadhi]| to be a |tie::bond, snare [saṅga]| in the world,
let a person train for its very removal.”

Then Māra the Evil One, thinking, “The Blessed One knows me, the Accomplished One knows me,” dejected and disappointed, disappeared right there.
