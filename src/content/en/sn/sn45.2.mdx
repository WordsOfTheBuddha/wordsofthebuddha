Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans, in a town named Nagaraka, a market town of the Sakyans. Then Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:

“Venerable sir, this is half of the spiritual life, that is, good friendship, good companionship, good association.”

“Do not say that, Ānanda, do not say that. The whole of the spiritual life is this — good friendship, good companionship, good association. It can be expected, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu with good friends, companions, and associates will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.

And how, Ānanda, does a bhikkhu with good friends, companions, and associates develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu develops |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]| |dependent on seclusion::supported by detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, |culminating in complete relinquishment::ripening in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|; similarly he develops |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is truthful, harmonious, gentle, and meaningful; abstaining from false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::mindfulness that discerns the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities clearly, grounded in diligent, non-forgetful attention to the present moment [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::perfect stability of mind, correct mental composure [sammāsamādhi]|, dependent on seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, culminating in complete relinquishment. It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu with good friends, companions, and associates develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.

By the following method too, Ānanda, it may be understood how the entire spiritual life is good friendship, good companionship, good association: by relying on me as a good friend, Ānanda, beings subject to birth are freed from birth; beings subject to aging are freed from aging; beings subject to death are freed from death; beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair are freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. By this method, Ānanda, it may be understood how the entire spiritual life is good friendship, good companionship, good association.”
