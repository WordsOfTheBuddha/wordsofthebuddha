At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu who practices the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| in accordance with the Dhamma, this is the natural outcome:

He dwells |often with disenchantment::filled with disinterest [nibbidābahula]| toward |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]|, dwells often with disenchantment toward |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, dwells often with disenchantment toward |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks sensory information by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, dwells often with disenchantment toward |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, and choices expressed as mental, verbal, and bodily activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); processes that produce kamma [saṅkhāra]|, dwells often with disenchantment toward |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]|.

When one dwells thus, full of disenchantment toward form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness, one |completely comprehends::fully understands [parijānāti]| form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness.

One who completely comprehends form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness is |completely freed from::totally liberated from [parimuccati]| form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, and consciousness. He is freed from birth, aging, and death, from |sorrow::grief, sadness [soka]|, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. I say that he is completely freed from |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”
