At Sāvatthi.

Then the Venerable Rādha approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he addressed him: “Venerable sir, how must one know, how must one see, so that in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external |signs::symbols, mental images, mental representations [nimitta]|, |I-making::self-identification, concept of individuality, I am this, this is me [ahaṅkāra]|, |mine-making::possessiveness, attachment, self-interest [mamaṅkāra]|, and the underlying tendency to |pride::conceit, egotism, superiority, self-comparison [māna]| cease to arise?”

“Any kind of |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one's body and external objects; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]| whatsoever, Rādha, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, deficient or refined, far or near—all form is to be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Any kind of |felt experience::pleasant, neutral or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| whatsoever, Rādha, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, deficient or refined, far or near—all felt experience is to be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Any kind of |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks things by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]| whatsoever, Rādha, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, deficient or refined, far or near—all perception is to be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Any kind of |intentional constructions::intentions, decisions, choices, volitional activities, constructed experiences, production of kamma; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]| whatsoever, Rādha, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, deficient or refined, far or near—all intentional constructions are to be seen with proper wisdom as they truly are: ‘These are not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

Any kind of |consciousness::quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind]; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]| whatsoever, Rādha, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, deficient or refined, far or near—all consciousness is to be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

When one knows and sees thus, Rādha, in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to pride cease to arise.” ...pe...
