At one time, many elder bhikkhus were dwelling at |fisherman‘s grove::name of a forest in Kāsi; lit. Macchikā‘s grove [macchikāsaṇḍa]| in the |Ambāṭaka::lit. wild mango [ambāṭaka]| forest. And on that occasion, after the meal, when those many elder bhikkhus had returned from the alms round, they gathered in the round pavilion and were seated together when this conversation arose among them:

“Friends, ‘|fetter::chain, bond, thing which binds [saṁyojana]|’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—are these different in meaning and different in expression, or are they the same in meaning but different only in expression?”

Then some of the elder bhikkhus answered thus: “Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—these are different in meaning and also different in expression.”

But some [other] elder bhikkhus answered thus: “Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—these are the same in meaning but different only in expression.”

Now at that time, |Citta the householder::foremost lay disciple of the Buddha in giving Dhamma discourses [citta]| had come to |Migapathaka::name of a village; lit. deer path [migapathaka]| on some business. And Citta the householder heard that after the meal, when many elder bhikkhus had returned from alms round and were seated together in the round pavilion, this discussion arose among them: “Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—are these different both in meaning and expression, or are they the same in meaning, differing only in expression?” Then some of the elder bhikkhus said: “Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—these are different both in meaning and expression.” But some of the elder bhikkhus said: “Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—these are the same in meaning, differing only in expression.”

Then Citta the householder approached the elder bhikkhus. Having drawn near, he bowed down to them and sat down to one side. As he was sitting there, Citta the householder said to the elder bhikkhus: “Venerable sirs, I have heard that after the meal, when many elder bhikkhus had returned from alms round and were gathered seated together in the round pavilion, this discussion arose among them: ‘Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—are these different both in meaning and expression, or are they the same in meaning, differing only in expression?’ Then some of the elder bhikkhus said: ‘Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—these are different both in meaning and expression.’ But some of the elder bhikkhus said: ‘Friends, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—these are the same in meaning, differing only in expression.’”

“That is so, householder.”

“Venerable sirs, ‘fetter’ and ‘things subject to being fettered’—these are different in meaning and also different in expression.

Venerable sirs, I shall give you a simile, for there are some wise persons who understand the meaning of a statement through a simile.

Suppose, venerable sirs, a black ox and a white ox were yoked together with a single rope or a leash. If someone were to say: ‘The black ox is the fetter of the white ox, and the white ox is the fetter of the black ox’—would that person be speaking rightly?”

“Certainly not, householder. The black ox is not the fetter of the white ox, nor is the white ox the fetter of the black ox. Rather, it is the rope or the leash by which they are yoked together—that is the fetter there.”

“In the same way, venerable sirs, the eye is not the fetter of |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]|, nor are forms the fetter of the eye. But rather, the |desire and attachment::desire-passion, sensual craving, intention of sensuality and lust [chandarāga]| that arises in dependence on both—that is the fetter there.

The ear is not the fetter of |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]|, <collapse>nor are sounds the fetter of the ear. But rather, the desire and attachment that arises in dependence on both—that is the fetter there.</collapse> The nose is not the fetter of |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]|, <collapse>nor are odors the fetter of the nose. But rather, the desire and attachment that arises in dependence on both—that is the fetter there.</collapse> The tongue is not the fetter of |tastes::flavors experienced through the tongue such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes like umami or astringency—any gustatory experience that can become an object of craving, indulgence, comfort, or sensory delight [rasā]|, <collapse>nor are tastes the fetter of the tongue. But rather, the desire and attachment that arises in dependence on both—that is the fetter there.</collapse> The body is not the fetter of |tangible objects::tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]|, <collapse>nor are tangible objects the fetter of the body. But rather, the desire and attachment that arises in dependence on both—that is the fetter there.</collapse> The mind is not the fetter of |mental objects::thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions, intentions, perceptions, concepts, beliefs, mental images, or constructs—any mental phenomena that arises internally and can become an object of clinging, identity, projection, craving, or aversion [dhammā]|, nor are mental objects the fetter of the mind. But rather, it is the desire and attachment that arises in dependence on both—that is the fetter there.”

“It is a blessing for you, householder, it is most fortunate for you, householder, in that you have the |eye of wisdom::insight [paññācakkhu]| that penetrates the profound word of the Buddha.”
