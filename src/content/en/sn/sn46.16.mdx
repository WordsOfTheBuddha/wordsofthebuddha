At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Rājagaha::name of a city; capital of Magadha; lit. king's house [rājagaha]|, in the Bamboo grove, the Squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time, the Blessed One was sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. Then venerable Mahācunda approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to venerable Mahācunda:

“Recite the factors of awakening, Cunda.”

“These seven factors of awakening, venerable sir, have been well taught by the Blessed One. When cultivated and frequently practiced, they lead to |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, to |full awakening::perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]|, and to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|. What seven? The |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]|, venerable sir, has been well taught by the Blessed One; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. <collapse>The |awakening factor of investigation of states::the quality of discriminative investigation into states, mental qualities and other phenomena; analyzing the teaching as a factor of enlightenment; second of the seven awakening factors [dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga]|, venerable sir, has been well taught by the Blessed One; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of energy::the quality of unrelenting effort, the sustaining power of persistence as a factor of enlightenment; third of the seven awakening factors [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]|, venerable sir, has been well taught by the Blessed One; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of joy::the quality of heartfelt gladness, spiritual rapture untainted by sensuality, as a factor of enlightenment; fourth of the seven awakening factors [pītisambojjhaṅga]|, venerable sir, has been well taught by the Blessed One; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]|, venerable sir, has been well taught by the Blessed One; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. The |awakening factor of collectedness::the quality of unification, stability, and deep stillness of the mind, as a factor of enlightenment; sixth of the seven awakening factors [samādhisambojjhaṅga]|, venerable sir, has been well taught by the Blessed One; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna.</collapse> The |awakening factor of equanimity::the quality of balanced observation, non-reactivity, and mental equipoise as a factor of enlightenment; seventh of the seven awakening factors [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]|, venerable sir, has been well taught by the Blessed One; when cultivated and frequently practiced, it leads to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna.”

“Surely, Cunda, [these are] the factors of awakening; surely, Cunda, [these are] the factors of awakening.”

The venerable Mahācunda said this. And the Blessed One recovered from that illness. In such a way, the Blessed One was cured of his illness.
