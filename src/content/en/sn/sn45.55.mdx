“Bhikkhus, just as dawn precedes and predicts the rising of the sun, so too does accomplishment in |wise attention::proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yoniso + manasikāra]| precede and predict the arising of the noble eightfold path for a bhikkhu. For a bhikkhu accomplished in wise attention and careful attending, it is to be expected that he will cultivate and frequently practice the noble eightfold path.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu accomplished in careful attention cultivate and frequently practice the noble eightfold path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]| |dependent on seclusion::supported by detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, |culminating in complete relinquishment::ripening in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|; similarly he develops |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is purified by abstaining from falsehood, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::perfect memory of the Dhamma; correct recollection of the exact instructions to guide one's practice [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::correct mental composure that stabilizes the mind and supports clarity of thoughts [sammāsamādhi]|, dependent on seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, culminating in complete relinquishment. Thus indeed, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu accomplished in wise attention and careful attending cultivates and frequently practices the noble eightfold path.”
