At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are vicious.

|With a mind obsessed::mentally obsessed with [pariyādiṇṇacitta]| and |overwhelmed::overcome, overpowered [abhibhūta]| by acquisitions, respect, and popularity, bhikkhus, |Devadatta::Devadatta was the Buddha’s cousin and a bhikkhu who, driven by ambition and envy, attempted to create a schism in the Saṅgha. [devadatta]|’s |root of the wholesome::root of merit [kusalamūla]| was cut off.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.’ Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
