“Bhikkhus, relying upon the Himalayas, the king of mountains, the |nāgās::reference to serpent beings. According to the commentary, pregnant nāgas ascend to the Himalayas to give birth in mountain ponds, safely away from ocean dangers like suparṇas and strong currents, training their young there until they are strong enough to reach the ocean. [nāgā]| nurture their bodies and acquire strength. When they have nurtured their bodies and acquired strength, they then enter into small pools. From the small pools, they move into lakes. From the lakes, they enter the streams; from the streams, they enter the great rivers; and from the great rivers, they finally they enter the ocean. There, they attain greatness and |expansiveness::full development, maturity [vepullatta]| of body.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who, relying on |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]| and being established in virtue, cultivates the seven factors of awakening and develops them frequently, attains greatness and expansiveness in regard to the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]|. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu, relying on virtue and being established in virtue, cultivate the seven factors of awakening and develop them frequently, thereby attaining greatness and expansiveness in regard to the mental qualities?

1) Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu cultivates |awakening factor of mindfulness::the quality of mindfulness leading to full awakening, remembering as a factor of enlightenment; first of the seven awakening factors [satisambojjhaṅga]|, which is |supported by seclusion::dependent on detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, and |culminates in complete relinquishment::ripens in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|.

2) a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of investigation of states::the quality of discriminative investigation into states, mental qualities and other phenomena; analyzing the teaching as an factor of enlightenment; second of the seven awakening factors [dhammavicayasambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

3) a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of energy::the quality of unrelenting effort, the sustaining power of persistence as a factor of enlightenment; third of the seven awakening factors [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

4) a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of joy::the quality of heartfelt gladness, spiritual rapture untainted by sensuality, as a factor of enlightenment; fourth of the seven awakening factors [pītisambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

5) a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of tranquility::the quality of inner stillness, bodily and mental calm, as a factor of enlightenment; fifth of the seven awakening factors [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

6) a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of collectedness::the quality of unification, stability, and deep focus of the mind, as a factor of enlightenment; sixth of the seven awakening factors [samādhisambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

7) a bhikkhu cultivates the |awakening factor of equanimity::the quality of balanced observation, non-reactivity, and mental equipoise as a factor of enlightenment; seventh of the seven awakening factors [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]|, which is supported by seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, and culminates in complete relinquishment.

In this way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, relying on virtue and being established in virtue, cultivates the seven factors of awakening and develops them frequently, thereby attaining greatness and expansiveness in regard to the mental qualities.”
