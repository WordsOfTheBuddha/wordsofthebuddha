“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of |clinging::grasping, acquiring, appropriating, taking possession, identifying [upādāna]|. What four? 1) Clinging to sensual pleasures, 2) |clinging to views::clinging to beliefs [diṭṭhupādāna]|, 3) |clinging to rules and observances::grasping at precepts and practices, adherence to rites and rituals [sīlabbatupādāna]|, and 4) |clinging to a doctrine of self::grasping at a theory of self, attachment to a soul theory [attavādupādāna]|. These are the four kinds of clinging.

Bhikkhus, for the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these four kinds of clinging, the four establishments of mindfulness |should be cultivated::should be developed [bhāvetabba]|.”
