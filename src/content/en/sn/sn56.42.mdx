Once upon a time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on the Vulture Peak Mountain.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, “Come, bhikkhus, let us approach the Inspiration Peak for the day’s abiding.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus responded to the Blessed One. Thereupon, the Blessed One, together with several bhikkhus, approached the Inspiration Peak.

There, a certain bhikkhu saw a great |precipice::cliff, steep drop [papāta]| at the Inspiration Peak and, having seen it, said to the Blessed One, “This, venerable sir, is a great precipice, truly frightening, venerable sir. Is there, venerable sir, another precipice greater and more terrifying than this one?”

“There is, bhikkhu, another precipice that is greater and more terrifying than this one.”

“And what, venerable sir, is another precipice greater and more terrifying than this one?”

“Whatever ascetics and brahmins who do not understand as it truly is, ‘This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,’ who do not understand as it truly is, ‘This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,’ who do not understand as it truly is, ‘This is the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|,’ and who do not understand as it truly is, ‘This is the |way of practice leading to the end of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|,’ they delight in |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, and choices expressed as mental, verbal, and bodily activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); processes that produce kamma [saṅkhāra]|leading to rebirth, in intentional constructs leading to aging, in intentional constructs leading to death, and in intentional constructs leading to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Delighting in intentional constructs leading to rebirth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, they choose to act on these intentional constructs. Having acted on these intentional constructs leading to rebirth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, they fall into the precipice of rebirth, the precipice of aging, the precipice of death, and the precipice of sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. They do not escape from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. I say, ‘They do not escape from suffering.’

And those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it truly is, ‘This is suffering,’ who understand as it truly is, ‘This is the arising of suffering,’ who understand as it truly is, ‘This is the ending of suffering,’ and who understand as it truly is, ‘This is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering,’ they do not delight in intentional constructs leading to rebirth, aging, death, and sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. Not delighting in these intentional constructs, they do not choose to act on these intentional constructs. Not acting on these intentional constructs leading to rebirth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, they do not fall into the precipice of rebirth, the precipice of aging, the precipice of death, and the precipice of sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. They escape from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. I say, ‘They escape from suffering.’

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to |fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: ‘This is suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the arising of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the ending of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering.’"
