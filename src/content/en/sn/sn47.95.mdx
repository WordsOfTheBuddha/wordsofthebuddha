“Bhikkhus, there are these four |floods::torrents, deluge [oghā]| [of defilements]. What four? The |flood of sensual pleasures::torrent of sensual desires [kāmogha]|, the |flood of continued existence::torrent of becoming [bhavogha]|, the |flood of views::torrent of beliefs [diṭṭhogha]|, and the |flood of ignorance::torrent of not understanding how things have come to be [avijjogha]|. These are the four floods.

Bhikkhus, for the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these four floods, the four establishments of mindfulness |should be cultivated::should be developed [bhāvetabba]|.”
