At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Icchānaṅgala::name of a brahmin village in Kosala [icchānaṅgala]|, in the Icchānaṅgala forest grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, I wish to go into seclusion for three months. I should not be approached by anyone, except for the one who brings me alms food.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. And no one approached him, except for the one who brought him alms food.

Then, when those three months had passed, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the bhikkhus:

“Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘In what dwelling, friends, did the Blessed One usually dwell during the rains retreat?’ —being asked this, you should answer those wanderers thus: ‘Friends, the Blessed One usually dwelt in the |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| [born from] from |mindfulness while breathing in and out::mindfulness during inhalation and exhalation [ānāpānassati]|.’

Here, bhikkhus, mindful I breathe in, mindful I breathe out.

1.) Breathing in long, I |discern::distinguish, understand, knows clearly [pajānāti]|: ‘I am breathing in long;’ breathing out long, I discern: ‘I am breathing out long.’
2.) Breathing in short, I discern: ‘I am breathing in short;’ breathing out short, I discern: ‘I am breathing out short.’
3.) I discern: ‘I am breathing in |experiencing the whole body::conscious of the whole body, sensitive to the whole process [sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī]|;’ <collapse>I discern: ‘I am breathing out experiencing the whole body.’ 4.) I discern: ‘I am breathing in |settling::calming, stilling [passambhayanta]| the |bodily constructs::bodily processes associated with breathing, specifically the in-and-out breath.

Bhikkhus, for if anyone, speaking rightly, could say of anything: ‘It is a noble dwelling, a |divine dwelling::sublime state [brahmavihāra]|, the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|’s dwelling,’ he would, speaking rightly, describe the collectedness [born from] mindfulness while breathing in and out as: ‘It is a noble dwelling, a divine dwelling, the |Tathāgata’s dwelling::Buddha’s state of mind [tathāgatavihāra]|.’

Those bhikkhus who are trainees, who have |not attained [their mind’s ideal]::not reached the goal; (comm) not attained arahantship [appattamānasa]|, who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage: for them, the collectedness [born from] mindfulness while breathing in and out, when cultivated and frequently practiced, leads to the |wearing away::exhaustion, depletion, gradual destruction [khaya]| of the |mental defilements::outflows, discharges, taints [āsavā]|.

And those bhikkhus who are arahants, |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|, who have fulfilled the spiritual life, who have done what had to be done, having put down the burden, having achieved the highest goal, |having exhausted the fetter of existence::who has worn away the bonds of continued conditional existence, i.e. the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojana]|, and having been liberated through complete comprehension: for them, the collectedness [born from] mindfulness while breathing in and out, when cultivated and frequently practiced, leads to a pleasant dwelling in this very life and to |clear present moment awareness::mindfulness and clear comprehension, mindful attentiveness [satisampajañña]|.

Bhikkhus, for if anyone, speaking rightly, could say of anything: ‘It is a noble dwelling, a divine dwelling, the Tathāgata’s dwelling,’ he would, speaking rightly, describe the collectedness [born from] mindfulness while breathing in and out as: ‘It is a noble dwelling, a divine dwelling, the Tathāgata’s dwelling.’”
