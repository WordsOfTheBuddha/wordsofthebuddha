“Friend Sāriputta, it is said ‘Awakening, awakening.’ But what, friend, is this |awakening::awakened state, enlightenment [arahatta]|?”

“Friend, the |wearing away of passion::exhaustion of intense desire, ending of strong emotions, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāgakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of aversion::ending of ill will, extinction of hatred [dosakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of delusion::wearing away of illusion, ending of hallucination, ending of misperceptions and distorted views [mohakkhaya]|—this is called awakening.”

“Friend, is there a path, is there a way of practice leading to the realization of awakening?”

“Friend, there is indeed a path, there is a way of practice, for the realization of this awakening.”

“And what, friend, is the path, what is the way of practice [is there] for the realization of awakening?”

“Friend, this Noble Eightfold Path itself is the way to realize awakening, namely — |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is truthful, harmonious, gentle, and meaningful; abstaining from false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::mindfulness that discerns the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities clearly, grounded in diligent, non-forgetful attention to the present moment [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::perfect stability of mind, correct mental composure [sammāsamādhi]|. This, friend, is the path; this is the way of practice for the realization of awakening.”

“|Auspicious::fine, excellent [bhaddaka]| is the path, friend, auspicious is the way of practice for the realization of awakening. And it is enough, friend Sāriputta, for [arousing] |diligence::quality of wishing to do one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]|.”
