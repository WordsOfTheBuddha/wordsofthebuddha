“Friend Sāriputta, it is said ‘Enlightenment, enlightenment.’ But what, friend, is this |enlightenment::awakened state, worthy state [arahatta]|?”

“Friend, the |wearing away of passion::exhaustion of intense desire, ending of strong emotions, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāgakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of aversion::ending of ill will, extinction of hatred [dosakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of delusion::wearing away of illusion, ending of hallucination, ending of misperceptions and distorted views [mohakkhaya]|—this is called enlightenment.”

“Friend, is there a path, is there a way of practice leading to the realization of enlightenment?”

“Friend, there is indeed a path, there is a way of practice, for the realization of this enlightenment.”

“And what, friend, is the path, what is the way of practice [is there] for the realization of enlightenment?”

“Friend, this Noble Eightfold Path itself is the way to realize enlightenment—namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness. This, friend, is the path; this is the way of practice for the realization of enlightenment.”
