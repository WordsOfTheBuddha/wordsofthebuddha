At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, whoever among ascetics or brahmins do not understand the |earth element::whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]|, do not understand the |arising::appearance, origination [samudaya]| of the earth element, do not understand the |ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]| of the earth element, and do not understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the earth element;

[Likewise, those who do not understand] the |water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|, do not understand the arising of the water element, do not understand the ending of the water element, and do not understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the water element;

[Likewise, those who do not understand] the |fire element::whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]|, do not understand the arising of the fire element, do not understand the ending of the fire element, and do not understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the fire element;

[And likewise, those who do not understand] the |wind element::whatever internal or external that is airy, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [vāyodhātu]|, do not understand the arising of the wind element, do not understand the ending of the wind element, do not understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the wind element;

they, bhikkhus, are not recognized by me as ascetics among ascetics or as brahmins among brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones do not, in this very life, |personally experience::realize for oneself [sacchikatvā]| and attain the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood through |direct knowledge::experiential realization [abhiññā]| and |abiding::dwelling, remaining, staying [viharati]| in it.

Bhikkhus, whoever among ascetics or brahmins understand the earth element, understand the arising of the earth element, understand the ending of the earth element, and understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the earth element;

[Likewise, those who understand] the water element, understand the arising of the water element, understand the ending of the water element, and understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the water element;

[Likewise, those who understand] the fire element, understand the arising of the fire element, understand the ending of the fire element, and understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the fire element;

[And likewise, those who understand] the wind element, understand the arising of the wind element, understand the ending of the wind element, and understand the way of practice leading to the ending of the wind element—

they, bhikkhus, are recognized by me as ascetics among ascetics and as brahmins among brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones, in this very life, personally experience and attain the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood through directly knowing and abiding in it.”
