At Sāvatthi ... There the Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the burden, the bearer of the burden, the taking up of the burden, and the putting down of the burden. Listen to this.

What, bhikkhus, is the burden? It should be said: The |five aggregates that are subject to clinging::the physical and mental heaps that are appropriated, grasped at, or taken as self; the fivefold collection of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness bound up with attachment [pañca + upādānakkhandha]|. Which five? The |form aggregate subject to clinging::attaching to the physical body or external objects as part of one’s identity or as something that provides lasting satisfaction [rūpupādānakkhandha]|, the |feeling aggregate subject to clinging::becoming attached to feelings of pleasure, resisting or rejecting feelings of pain, and becoming indifferent or unaware of neutral feelings. This clinging leads to grasping after pleasant sensations, aversion to painful ones, and ignorance of neutral feelings [vedanupādānakkhandha]|, the |perception aggregate subject to clinging::becoming attached to how one interprets and perceives things — believing one’s perceptions are fixed, true, or part of our self. It can also involve attaching to concepts, labels, and judgments that arise from perception. [saññupādānakkhandha]|, the |intentional constructs aggregate subject to clinging::attachment to, or identification with one’s intentions, emotions, and decisions as part of “who I am.” This creates a strong sense of self around one’s volitional activities, as if “I am the one who wills, chooses, or acts.” [saṅkhārupādānakkhandha]|, and the |consciousness aggregate subject to clinging::attachment to, or identification with, quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind] [viññāṇupādānakkhandha]|. This, bhikkhus, is called the burden.

And who, bhikkhus, is the bearer of the burden? It should be said: the person. This venerable one of such name and such lineage—is called the bearer of the burden.

And what, bhikkhus, is the taking up of the burden? Whatever |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| [there is that] leads to rebirth, accompanied by |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]| and |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|, i.e. |seeking delight here and there::thoroughly enjoying this and that [tatratatrābhinandī]|—namely, craving for sensual pleasure, |craving for becoming::craving for continued existence, desire for a stable identity, attachment to a future self, attainment, or experience [bhavataṇhā]|, and |craving for non-becoming::A craving to end suffering through erasure of current experience or identity, e.g. “This self is unbearable; I want out.” [vibhavataṇhā]|. This, bhikkhus, is called the taking up of the burden.

And what, bhikkhus, is the putting down of the burden? It is the |complete fading away and ending::remainderless dispassion and cessation [asesavirāganirodha]| of that very craving, giving up of it, |relinquishing of it::abandoning of it, complete giving up of it [paṭinissagga]|, freedom from it, and |non-reliance on::non-attachment to [anālaya]| it. This, bhikkhus, is called the putting down of the burden.”

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Accomplished One further said this:

“The five aggregates are truly burdensome,
The person is the burden bearer;
Taking up the burden is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| in the world,
laying the burden down leads to |contentment::ease, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]|.

Having laid the heavy burden down,
without taking up another burden;
Uprooting craving at the source,
one is |satiated::free from craving, desireless [nicchāta]|, |completely quenched::completely cooled wrt the mental defilements [parinibbuta]|.”
