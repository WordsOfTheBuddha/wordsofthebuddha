"Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation), attains collectedness, attains one-pointedness of mind—this is called 'collectedness arising from aspiration.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the arising of wholesome and skillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, development, and fulfillment of wholesome and skillful states that have arisen. These are called 'volitional formations of striving' (intentional effort). Thus, this aspiration, this collectedness arising from aspiration, and accompanied by intentional effort — this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration and intentional effort.

Similarly, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on energy (persistence), attains collectedness, attains one-pointedness of mind—this is called 'collectedness arising from energy.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the arising of wholesome and skillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, development, and fulfillment of wholesome and skillful states that have arisen. These are called 'volitional formations of striving' (intentional effort). Thus, this energy, this collectedness arising from energy, and accompanied by intentional effort—this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy and intentional effort.

"Similarly, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on [purification of] mind, attains collectedness, attains one-pointedness of mind—this is called 'collectedness arising from mind.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen.

These are called 'volitional formations of striving' (intentional effort). Thus, this mind, this collectedness arising from mind, and accompanied by intentional effort—this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from mind and intentional effort.

Similarly, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination), attains collectedness, attains one-pointedness of mind—this is called 'collectedness arising from investigation.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the arising of wholesome and skillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, development, and fulfillment of wholesome and skillful states that have arisen. These are called 'volitional formations of striving' (intentional effort). Thus, this investigation, this collectedness arising from investigation, and accompanied by intentional effort—this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation and intentional effort."
