"Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]|, attains |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|, attains |unification [of mind]::one-pointedness, concentration, oneness [ekaggatā]|—this is called 'collectedness arising from aspiration.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the arising of wholesome and skillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, development, and fulfillment of wholesome and skillful states that have arisen. These are called '|intentional constructions of striving::intentional effort [padhānasaṅkhāra]|.' Thus, this aspiration, this collectedness arising from aspiration, and accompanied by intentional effort — this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration and intentional effort.

Similarly, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]|, attains collectedness, attains unification of mind—this is called 'collectedness arising from determination.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the arising of wholesome and skillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, development, and fulfillment of wholesome and skillful states that have arisen. These are called 'intentional constructions of striving.' Thus, this determination, this collectedness arising from determination, and accompanied by intentional effort—this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from determination and intentional effort.

"Similarly, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]|, attains collectedness, attains unification of mind—this is called 'collectedness arising from mind.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the arising of wholesome and skillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, development, and fulfillment of wholesome and skillful states that have arisen. These are called 'intentional constructions of striving.' Thus, this mind, this collectedness arising from mind, and accompanied by intentional effort—this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from mind and intentional effort.

Similarly, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu, relying on |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]|, attains collectedness, attains unification of mind—this is called 'collectedness arising from investigation.' He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the non-arising of unwholesome and unskillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the abandonment of unwholesome and unskillful states that have arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the arising of wholesome and skillful states that have not yet arisen. He generates aspiration, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, development, and fulfillment of wholesome and skillful states that have arisen. These are called 'intentional constructions of striving.' Thus, this investigation, this collectedness arising from investigation, and accompanied by intentional effort—this is called, bhikkhus, the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation and intentional effort."
