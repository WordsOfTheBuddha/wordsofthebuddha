“Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit, outflows of good, and supports for ease. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with perfect clarity in the Buddha — Indeed, the Blessed One is an |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|, perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, a teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One. This is the first stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with perfect clarity in the teachings of the Buddha — Indeed, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, |onward leading::applicable, relevant, practical [opaneyyika]|, to be personally experienced by the wise. This is the second stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with perfect clarity in the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| — The community of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this community of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. This is the third stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is wise, endowed with |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]| that discerns the |arising and passing away::appearance and disappearance, formation and dissolution [udayatthagāmī]|, which is noble and penetrative, |leading to the complete ending of suffering::leading to extinction of stress, leading to gradual and complete wearing away of discontentment [dukkhakkhayagāmī]|. This is the fourth stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

These indeed, bhikkhus, are the four streams of merit, outflows of good, and supports for ease.”
