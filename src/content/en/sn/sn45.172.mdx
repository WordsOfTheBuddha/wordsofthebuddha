“Bhikkhus, there are these four |bonds::yokes, attachment, which binds one to the round of cyclical existence [yoga]|. What four? The |bond of sensual pleasures::yoke of sensual pleasures [kāmayoga]|, the |bond of continued existence::yoke of becoming [bhavayoga]|, the |bond of views::yoke of beliefs [diṭṭhiyoga]|, and the |bond of ignorance::bondage from not understanding how things have come to be [avijjāyoga]|. These are the four bonds.

Bhikkhus, for the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these four bonds, the Noble Eightfold Path |should be developed::should be cultivated [bhāvetabba]|.”
