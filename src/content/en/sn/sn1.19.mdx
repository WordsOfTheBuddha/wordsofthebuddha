“Don’t you have a little hut?
Don’t you have a nest?
Don’t you have any ties that extend?
Are you freed from bondage?”

“Surely, I have no little hut,
Surely, I have no nest;
Surely, I have no ties that extend,
Surely, I am freed from bondage.”

“What do you think I call a little hut?
What do I say is a nest?
What do I say are ties that extend?
What do you think I call as bondage?”

“It is a mother that you call a little hut,
it is a wife that you call a nest;
It is children that you call ties that extend,
it is |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| that you call bondage.”

“It is good that you have no little hut,
good that you have no nest;
Good that you have no ties that extend,
good that you are freed from bondage.”
