“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the |duality::a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different, dichotomy [dvaya]|. Listen to this.

What, bhikkhus, is the duality? The eye and |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]|, ear and |sounds::auditory objects such as various sounds, noises, melodic compositions, verbal expression, whether of praise, blame, honor, respect, disrespect [saddā]|, nose and |odors::smells, scents, fragrances, aromas, stench, perfumes, or natural fragrances such as of flowers, food, or earth [gandhā]|, tongue and |tastes::flavors, tastes, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes such as umami or astringency [rasā]|, body and |tangibles::tangible objects such as physical surfaces, textures, fabrics, water, air, heat, cold, bodily pressure, or contact with living beings [phoṭṭhabbā]|, mind and |mental objects::thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions, intentions, perceptions, concepts, beliefs, mental images, or fabrications arising from past experiences and future projections [dhammā]|—this is called the duality.

If anyone, bhikkhus, should speak thus: ‘Having rejected this duality, I shall make known another duality’ — that would be a mere empty boast on his part. If he was questioned, he would not be able to reply and, further, he would meet with |vexation::affliction, irritation [vighāta]|. For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, that would not be within his |objective field::domain, realm, sphere [visaya]|.”
