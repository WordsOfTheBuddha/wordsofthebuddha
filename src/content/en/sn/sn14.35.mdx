At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, whoever delights in the \|earth element::whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]|, delights in [what is subject to] |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|. Whoever delights in what is subject to suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering.

Whoever delights in the \|water element::whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]|, delights in what is subject to suffering. Whoever delights in what is subject to suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering.

Whoever delights in the \|fire element::whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]|, delights in what is subject to suffering.
