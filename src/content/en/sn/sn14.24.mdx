At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, beings come together and associate \{according to disposition} (in line with their mental qualities or inclinations [dhātuso]). The faithless (without confidence, without conviction [assaddhā]) come together and associate with the faithless; the unashamed (shameless, without conscience [ahirikā]) come together and associate with the unashamed; the \{morally reckless} (fearlessness of wrongdoing, lack of prudence [anottappa]) come together and associate with the morally reckless; the unprincipled (without regard for ethical conduct [dussīlā]) come together and associate with the unprincipled; the undiscerning (without wisdom [duppaññā]) come together and associate with the undiscerning.

The faithful (confident, believing, devoted, trusting [saddhā]) come together and associate with the faithful; the conscientious (honorable [hirimā]) come together and associate with the conscientious; the virtuous (ethical, moral [sīlavant]) come together and associate with the virtuous; the wise (discerning, percipient [paññavanto]) come together and associate with the wise."
