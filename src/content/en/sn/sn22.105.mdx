“Bhikkhus, I will teach you |personal existence::the felt sense of being someone; the five aggregates subject to clinging; the totality of psycho-physical experience within which a sense of “I” or “mine” arises [sakkāya]|, the arising of personal existence, the end of personal existence, and the path leading to the end of personal existence. Listen to this.

And what, bhikkhus, is personal existence? It should be said: The |five aggregates subject to clinging::the physical and mental heaps that are appropriated, grasped at, or taken as self; the fivefold collection of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness bound up with attachment [pañca + upādānakkhandha]|. What five? They are namely, the |form aggregate subject to clinging::attaching to the physical body or external objects as part of one’s identity or as something that provides lasting satisfaction [rūpupādānakkhandha]|, the |feeling aggregate subject to clinging::becoming attached to feelings of pleasure, resisting or rejecting feelings of pain, and becoming indifferent or unaware of neutral feelings. This clinging leads to grasping after pleasant sensations, aversion to painful ones, and ignorance of neutral feelings [vedanupādānakkhandha]|, the |perception aggregate subject to clinging::becoming attached to how one interprets and perceives things — believing one’s perceptions are fixed, true, or part of our self. It can also involve attaching to concepts, labels, and judgments that arise from perception. [saññupādānakkhandha]|, the |intentional constructs aggregate subject to clinging::attachment to, or identification with one’s intentions, emotions, and decisions as part of “who I am.” This creates a strong sense of self around one’s volitional activities, as if “I am the one who wills, chooses, or acts.” [saṅkhārupādānakkhandha]|, and the |consciousness aggregate subject to clinging::attachment to, or identification with, quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind] [viññāṇupādānakkhandha]|. This, bhikkhus, is called personal existence.

And what, bhikkhus, is the arising of personal existence? Whatever |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| [there is that] leads to rebirth, <collapse>accompanied by |delight::pleasure, enjoyment, relish [nandi]| and |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|, i.e. |seeking delight here and there::thoroughly enjoying this and that [tatratatrābhinandī]|—namely, craving for sensual pleasure, |craving for becoming::craving for continued existence, desire for a stable identity, attachment to a future self, attainment, or experience [bhavataṇhā]|, and |craving for non-becoming::A craving to end suffering through erasure of current experience or identity, e.g. “This self is unbearable; I want out.” [vibhavataṇhā]|.</collapse> This, bhikkhus, is called the arising of personal existence.

And what, bhikkhus, is the end of personal existence? It is the |complete fading away and ending::remainderless dispassion and cessation [asesavirāganirodha]| of that very craving, <collapse>giving up of it, |relinquishing of it::abandoning of it, complete giving up of it [paṭinissagga]|, freedom from it, and |non-reliance on::non-attachment to [anālaya]| it.</collapse> This, bhikkhus, is called the end of personal existence.

And what, bhikkhus, is the |way of practice::path of progress [paṭipada]| leading to the end of personal existence? It is this very Noble Eightfold Path, namely — |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, <collapse>|right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is purified by abstaining from falsehood, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::perfect memory of the Dhamma; correct recollection of the exact instructions to guide one's practice [sammāsati]|, and</collapse> |right collectedness::correct mental composure that stabilizes the mind and supports clarity of thoughts [sammāsamādhi]|. This, bhikkhus, is called the way of practice leading to the end of personal existence.”
