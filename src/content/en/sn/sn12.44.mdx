At Sāvatthi.

“I will teach you, bhikkhus, both the arising and the dissolution of the world. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“And what, bhikkhus, is the arising of the world? Dependent on the eye and |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]|, |eye-consciousness::awareness of visible forms; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [cakkhuviññāṇa]| arises. The meeting of the three is |contact::sense impingement, raw experience, touch [phassa]|. With contact as a condition, there arises |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|; with felt experience as a condition, |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| arises; with craving as a condition, |clinging::grasping, acquiring, appropriating, taking possession, identifying [upādāna]| arises; with clinging as a condition, |existence::being, becoming; continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]| arises; with existence as a condition, |birth::rebirth, conception, coming into existence [jāti]| arises; with birth as a condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise. This, bhikkhus, is the arising of the world.

Dependent on the ear and |sounds::auditory experiences such as speech, music, praise, blame, ambient noise, verbal expression, or melodic tones—any sound that can stir emotion, craving for praise, aesthetic delight, or attachment to communication and identity [saddā]|, |ear-consciousness::auditory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [sotaviññāṇa]| arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises.

Dependent on the nose and |odors::smells and fragrances experienced through the nose, including perfumes, flowers, food aromas, earth after rain, incense, or even stench—any olfactory experience that may evoke craving, aversion, nostalgia, comfort, or sensual pleasure [gandhā]|, |nose-consciousness::olfactory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [ghānaviññāṇa]| arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises.

Dependent on the tongue and |tastes::flavors experienced through the tongue such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes like umami or astringency—any gustatory experience that can become an object of craving, indulgence, comfort, or sensory delight [rasā]|, |tongue-consciousness::gustatory awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [jivhāviññāṇa]| arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises.

Dependent on the body and |tangible objects::tangible contact such as the feel of skin, warmth, softness, intimacy, physical affection, or sensations like massage, breath, water, air, pressure—anything felt through the body that can become an object of desire, arousal, comfort, or emotional attachment [phoṭṭhabba]|, |body-consciousness::tactile awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [kāyaviññāṇa]| arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises.

Dependent on the mind and |mental objects::thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions, intentions, perceptions, concepts, beliefs, mental images, or constructs—any mental phenomena that arises internally and can become an object of clinging, identity, projection, craving, or aversion [dhammā]|, |mind-consciousness::mental awareness; it does not interpret or recognize meaning—only cognizes and distinguishes [manoviññāṇa]| arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises. With craving as a condition, clinging arises; with clinging as a condition, existence arises; with existence as a condition, birth arises; with birth as a condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arises. This, bhikkhus, is the arising of the world.

And what, bhikkhus, is the dissolution of the world? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises. With the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes the cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging comes the cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence comes the cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. This, bhikkhus, is the dissolution of the world.

Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises. 

Dependent on the nose and odors, nose-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises.

Dependent on the tongue and tastes, tongue-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises.

Dependent on the body and tactile objects, body-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises.

Dependent on the mind and mental objects, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a condition, there arises felt experience; with felt experience as a condition, craving arises. With the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging comes cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence comes cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. This, bhikkhus, is the dissolution of the world.
