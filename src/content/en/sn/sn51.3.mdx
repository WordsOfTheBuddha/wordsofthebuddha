"Bhikkhus, these four |bases of psychic abilities::bases for spiritual power [iddhipādā]|, when developed and frequently practiced, are noble and |leading to liberation::redemptive, leading to deliverance [niyyānika]|; they lead one who practices rightly to the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort.

These, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic abilities, which, when developed and frequently practiced, are noble and lead to liberation, guiding one who practices correctly to the complete ending of suffering."
