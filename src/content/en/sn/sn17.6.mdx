At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, acquisitions (gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]), respect (honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]), and popularity (fame, praise [siloka]) are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Whom should a thunderbolt strike, bhikkhus? A trainee upon whom acquisitions, respect, and popularity come while his mind has \{not yet reached the goal} (not mentally attained, not reached Arahantship [appattamānasa]).

Bhikkhus, the term 'Thunderbolt' is a designation for acquisitions, respect, and popularity.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to occupy (obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]) our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
