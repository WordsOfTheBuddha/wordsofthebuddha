At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, |dependent on::contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]| the |diversity of elements::variety of foundational properties making up experience—earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness; basis for bodily and mental phenomena; multiplicity of conditioned building blocks mistaken for self [dhātunānatta]|, there arises a diversity of contacts. Diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts.

And what is the diversity of elements? The |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpadhātu]|, |sounds::auditory objects such as various sounds, noises, melodic compositions, verbal expression, whether of praise, blame, honor, respect, disrespect [saddadhātu]|, |odors::smells, scents, fragrances, aromas, stench, perfumes, or natural fragrances such as of flowers, food, or earth [gandhadhātu]|, |tastes::flavors, tastes, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes such as umami or astringency [rasadhātu]|, |tangible objects::physical surfaces, textures, fabrics, water, air, heat, cold, bodily pressure, or contact with living beings [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]|, and |mental objects::thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions, intentions, perceptions, concepts, beliefs, mental images, or fabrications arising from past experiences and future projections [dhammadhātu]|. This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises the diversity of contacts, and that the diversity of elements does not arise from the diversity of contacts?

Dependent on the forms, there arises a |contact with the eye::visual impression, visual experience [cakkhusamphassa]|, the forms do not arise from the contact with the eye.
Dependent on sounds, there arises a |contact with the ear::auditory impression, sonic experience [sotasamphassa]|, sounds do not arise from the contact with the ear.
Dependent on smells, there arises a |contact with the nose::olfactory impression, nasal experience [ghanasamphassa]|, smells do not arise from the contact with the nose.
Dependent on tastes, there arises a |contact with the tongue::gustatory impression, taste experience [jivhāsamphassa]|, tastes do not arise from the contact with the tongue.
Dependent on tangible objects, there arises a |physical contact::tactile impression, somatic experience [kāyasamphassa]|, tangible objects do not arise from the physical contact.
Dependent on mental objects, there arises a |contact with the mind::mental impression, cognitive experience [manasamphassa]|, mental objects do not arise from the contact with the mind.

Thus, bhikkhus, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts. Diversity of elements does not arise from the diversity of contacts."
