At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), there arises a diversity of contacts. Diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts.

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises the diversity of contacts, and that the diversity of elements does not arise from the diversity of contacts?

Dependent on the objects of vision, there arises a \{contact with the eye} (visual impression, visual experience [cakkhusamphassa]), the objects of vision do not arise from the contact with the eye.
Dependent on sounds, there arises a \{contact with the ear} (auditory impression, sonic experience [sotasamphassa]), sounds do not arise from the contact with the ear.
Dependent on smells, there arises a \{contact with the nose} (olfactory impression, nasal experience [ghanasamphassa]), smells do not arise from the contact with the nose.
Dependent on tastes, there arises a \{contact with the tongue} (gustatory impression, taste experience [jivhāsamphassa]), tastes do not arise from the contact with the tongue.
Dependent on physical sensations, there arises a \{physical contact} (tactile impression, somatic experience [kāyasamphassa]), physical sensations do not arise from the physical contact.
Dependent on mental objects, there arises a \{contact with the mind} (mental impression, cognitive experience [manasamphassa]), mental objects do not arise from the contact with the mind.

Thus, bhikkhus, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts. Diversity of elements does not arise from the diversity of contacts."
