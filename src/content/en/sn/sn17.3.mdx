At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Once, bhikkhus, in a certain lake, there lived a large family of turtles for a long time. Then, one turtle said to another: ‘Dear turtle, please don’t go to that particular area.’

But that turtle went to that area, and there, a hunter struck it with a |harpoon::A thrown or dropped spear-like weapon, often used in fishing or hunting, which is typically attached to a rope or cord. [papatā]|.

Then, that turtle went to where the other turtle was. When the first turtle saw him coming from a distance, he said to him: ‘Dear turtle, surely you didn’t go to that area?’

‘I did go to that area, dear turtle.’

‘Surely, dear turtle, you are not injured or struck?’

‘I am uninjured, dear turtle, not struck, but there is little string trailing from the rear of my back.’

‘Truly, dear turtle, you are |injured::hurt [khata]|; truly, you are struck. It is because of this string, dear turtle, that your fathers and grandfathers met with misfortune, met with disaster. Now go, dear turtle, you are no longer one of us.’

Bhikkhus, the term 'hunter' is a designation for |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| the Evil One.

The term 'harpoon' is a designation for acquisitions, respect, and popularity.

The term 'little string' is a designation for delighting in |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|.

Any bhikkhu who |relishes::enjoys the taste of, takes pleasure in [assādeti]| and longs for arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity is called a bhikkhu who has been struck with a harpoon, who has met with misfortune and disaster, and the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
