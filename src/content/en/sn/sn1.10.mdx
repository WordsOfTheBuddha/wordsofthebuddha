At Sāvatthi.

Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

“For those dwelling in the |wilderness::forest, remoteness [arañña]|,
peaceful ones who live the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]|;
Eating only one meal a day,
how does their complexion become serene?”

[The Blessed One]: “They don’t |sorrow::grieve [socati]| over the past,
nor do they yearn for the future;
They continue to live through the present,
by this, their complexion becomes |serene::bright, clear [pasīdati]|.

By |yearning::praying, longing [pajappati]| for the future,
and |mourning for::regretting [anusocanā]| the past;
Through this, ignorant persons dry up and wither away,
like a green reed cut down.”
