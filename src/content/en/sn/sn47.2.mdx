Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Vesālī::capital of the Licchavīs [vesālī]|, in |Ambapālī's grove::A mango grove in Vesāli donated by Āmrapāli, the celebrated royal courtesan of the city. [ambapālivana]|. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell with |mindfulness::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, felt experience in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of themselves [sata]| and with |full awareness::attentiveness, clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]|. This is my instruction to you.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu mindful? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the mind in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world.

It is in this manner, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is mindful.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu fully aware? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with |full awareness::clear comprehension [sampajāna]| when going forward and returning; who acts with full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts with full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts with full awareness in wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts with full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts with full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts with full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent. It is in this manner, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is fully aware.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should thus live mindfully and with full awareness. This is my instruction to you.”
