At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell with |mindfulness::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, felt experience in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of themselves [sata]| and with |full awareness::attentiveness, clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]|. This is my instruction to you.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu mindful? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the mind in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world.

It is in this manner, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is mindful.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu fully aware? Here, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu, felt experiences are known as they arise, known as they remain, and known as they disappear. |Thoughts::reflection [vitakkā]| are known as they arise, known as they remain, and known as they disappear. Perceptions are known as they arise, known as they remain, and known as they disappear. It is in this manner, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is fully aware.

Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should live mindfully and with full awareness. This is my instruction to you.”
