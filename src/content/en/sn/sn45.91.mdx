At Sāvatthi.

"Just as, bhikkhus, the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.

And how does a bhikkhu who develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slant, slope, and incline towards Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view |dependent on seclusion::supported by detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, |culminating in complete relinquishment::ripening in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|; similarly he develops right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness, dependent on seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, culminating in complete relinquishment. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna."
