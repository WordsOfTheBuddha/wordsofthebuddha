“Just as, bhikkhus, the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.

And how does a bhikkhu who develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slant, slope, and incline towards Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]| |dependent on seclusion::supported by detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, |culminating in complete relinquishment::ripening in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|; similarly he develops |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is purified by abstaining from falsehood, divisive talk, harsh words, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::perfect memory of the Dhamma; correct recollection of the exact instructions to guide one's practice [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::correct mental composure that stabilizes the mind and supports clarity of thoughts [sammāsamādhi]|, dependent on seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, culminating in complete relinquishment. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”
