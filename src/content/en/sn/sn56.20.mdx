"These four things, bhikkhus, are true, unerring, and not otherwise. What four? 'This is |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,' bhikkhus, this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise; 'This is the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,' this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise; 'This is the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|,' this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise; 'This is the |way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|,' this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise. These, bhikkhus, are the four truths that are true, unerring, and not otherwise.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to |fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
