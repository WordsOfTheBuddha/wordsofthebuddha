At one time, the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Ānanda were dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. Then, in the evening, the venerable Ānanda, having emerged from seclusion, approached the venerable Sāriputta and, after paying respects, sat down to one side. Seated there, the venerable Ānanda said to the venerable Sāriputta:

"Friend Sāriputta, on account of how many qualities has the Blessed One declared that a person is a stream-enterer, no longer subject to downfall, fixed in destiny, and headed for full awakening?"

"Friend, it is on account of four qualities that a person has been declared by the Blessed One to be a stream-enterer, no longer subject to downfall, fixed in destiny, and headed for full awakening.

What four? Here, friend, a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is the Worthy One, perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in wisdom and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One.' He is endowed with experiential confidence in the teachings of the Buddha: 'Indeed, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, |onward leading::applicable, relevant, practical [opaneyyika]|, to be personally experienced by the wise.' He is endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha: 'Indeed, the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the knowledgeable way, practicing the proper way; these are the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' He is endowed with virtues that are dear to the noble ones—unbroken, unblemished, not patchy, untarnished, liberating, praised by the wise, not clung to, |leading to collectedness::leading to samadhi, conducive to mental composure [samādhisaṃvattanika]|.

It is on account of these four qualities, friend, that a person has been declared by the Blessed One to be a stream-enterer, no longer subject to downfall, fixed in destiny, and headed for full awakening."
