"Bhikkhus, there are these Four Noble Truths. What four? The Noble Truth of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, the Noble Truth of the \|arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|, the Noble Truth of the \|ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|, the Noble Truth of the \|way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the noble eightfold path [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.

Bhikkhus, these Four Noble Truths are |actual::true, real [tatha]|, unchanging, and not otherwise; therefore, they are called the Noble Truths.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to \|fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
