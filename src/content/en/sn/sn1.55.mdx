[A deity asked]: “What gives rise to a person?
What does he have that |wanders about::roams around, runs astray [vidhāvati]|?
What |experiences cyclic existence::experiences wandering on, suffers passing from one state of existence to the next [saṃsāramāpādi]|?
What is his great fear?”

[The Blessed One]: “|Craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| gives rise to a person,
his |mind::the faculty of thought and intention, often restless or wandering [citta]| is what wanders about;
A |sentient being::living being; what is clung to, stuck to, attached to [satta]| experiences cyclic existence,
|suffering::lit. that which is difficult to endure [dukkhama]| is his great fear.”
