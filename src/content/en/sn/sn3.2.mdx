At Sāvatthi.

Then, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how many qualities are there which, when they arise within a person, arise for their |harm::disadvantage, misfortune [ahita]|, for their |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, and for their |troubled living::afflicted abiding [aphāsuvihāra]|?”

“There are, great king, three qualities which, when they arise within a person, arise for their harm, for their suffering, and for their troubled living. What are the three? |Greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]|, great king, is a quality which, when it arises within a person, arises for their harm, for their suffering, and for their troubled living. |Aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, great king, is a quality which, when it arises within a person, arises for their harm, for their suffering, and for their troubled living. |Delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|, great king, is a quality which, when it arises within a person, arises for their harm, for their suffering, and for their troubled living. These, great king, are the three qualities which, when they arise within a person, arise for their harm, for their suffering, and for their troubled living.

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Accomplished One further said this:

“Greed, aversion, and delusion,
afflict the person with a |corrupt mind::evil-minded, a mind with defilements [pāpacetasa]|;
They arise from within and harm him,
as its own fruit destroys the |reed::bamboo; lit. hardwood skin [tacasāra]|.”
