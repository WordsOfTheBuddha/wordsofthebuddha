At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Whom should a |barbless::without the spike, a danger that is intangible but deeply piercing [visalla]| dart \|dipped in poison::smeared with venom [diddhagata]| strike, bhikkhus? Let acquisitions, respect, and popularity reach a trainee whose mind has \|not yet reached the goal::not mentally attained, not reached Arahantship [appattamānasa]|.

The term 'dart', bhikkhus, is a designation for acquisitions, respect, and popularity.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to |occupy::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
