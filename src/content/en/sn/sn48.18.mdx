“Bhikkhus, these are the five faculties. Which five? The faculty of |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]|, |energy::willpower, determination [vīriya]|, |mindfulness::memory, remembering, recollection, keeping in mind [sati]|, |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| and |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]|.

Bhikkhus, through the completion and fulfillment of these five faculties, one is an |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|. With faculties weaker than that, one is practicing for the realization of the fruit of Arahantship. With faculties weaker than that, one is a |non-returner::third stage of awakening where the lower five fetters of 1] personal existence, i.e. view that one is an embodied being, 2] doubt regarding suffering, the arising of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path leading to the end of suffering, 3] adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation, 4] sensual desire and 5] ill will are completely overcome [anāgāmī]|; with faculties weaker than that, one is practicing for the fruit of non-returning. With faculties weaker than that, one is a |once-returner::the second stage of awakening where one has completely exhausted the fetters of 1] personal existence, 2] doubt, perplexity, or indecisiveness, and 3] adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation, and made significant progress in overcoming the fetters of 4] sensual desire and 5] ill will [sakadāgāmī]|; with faculties weaker than that, one is practicing for the fruit of once-returning. With faculties weaker than that, one is a |stream-enterer::the first stage of awakening, attained by completely abandoning the three fetters: 1) personal existence view - identity view, belief in a self, 2) doubt or perplexity regarding suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the end of suffering, and 3) adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation [sotāpanna]|; with faculties weaker than that, one is practicing for the fruit of stream-entry.

But, bhikkhus, I say that one in whom these five faculties are completely and totally absent is ‘an outsider, one who stands in the faction of common people.’”
