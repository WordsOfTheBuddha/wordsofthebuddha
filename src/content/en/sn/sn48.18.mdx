“Bhikkhus, these are the five faculties. Which five? The faculty of |confidence::faith|, |persistence::energy|, mindfulness, |collectedness::concentration| and wisdom.

Among these, bhikkhus, when the five faculties are fully developed, one is an |Arahant::perfectly enlightened|. Those who are lesser in the development of these faculties are practicing for the realization of the fruit of Arahantship. Those milder still are non-returners; those even milder are practicing for the fruit of non-returning. Those milder still are once-returners; those even milder are practicing for the fruit of once-returning. Those milder still are |stream-enterers::A stream-enterer is an individual who has attained the first stage of awakening, having completely abandoned the three fetters: 1) personal existence view - identity view, belief in a self, 2) doubt or perplexity regarding suffering, its arising, its ending, and the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering, and 3) adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation [sotāpanna]|; those even milder are practicing for the fruit of stream-entry.

If anyone, bhikkhus, is completely devoid of these five faculties, I declare that such a person stands outside, in the faction of the ordinary person.”
