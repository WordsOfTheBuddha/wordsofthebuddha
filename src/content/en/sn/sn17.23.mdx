At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Bhikkhus, a |faithful::confident, believing, devoted, trusting [saddhā]| laywoman, imploring her |dear::beloved [piya]| and |pleasing::agreeable, likeable [manāpa]| only son, should rightly implore him thus: ‘Dear, you should become like the householder Citta and Hatthaka of Āḷavi’—for, bhikkhus, this is the measure and standard for my lay disciples, namely, the |householder Citta::foremost lay disciple of the Buddha in giving Dhamma discourses [citta]| and |Hatthaka of Āḷavi::foremost lay disciple of the Buddha in maintaining a following through the four means of social cohesion. Read more about him in [AN 8.23 - Paṭhamahatthaka sutta](/an8.23). [hatthaka]|.

‘But if, dear, you go forth from the household life into homelessness, then you should become like Sāriputta and Moggallāna’—for, bhikkhus, this is the measure and standard for my bhikkhu disciples, namely, |Sāriputta::foremost disciple of the Buddha in great wisdom [sāriputta]| and |Moggallāna::foremost disciple of the Buddha in psychic power; lit. Moggallāna the great [moggallāna]|.

‘May it not be, dear, that acquisitions, respect, and popularity come upon you while you are still a |trainee::learner, one of the seven stages of a noble person before full awakening [sekha]| whose mind has |not yet reached the goal::not mentally attained, not reached Arahantship [appattamānasa]|.’

If, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity come upon a trainee bhikkhu whose mind has not yet reached the goal, that becomes an obstacle for him.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.’ Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
