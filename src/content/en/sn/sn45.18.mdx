Thus have I heard—At one time, the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Bhadda were dwelling in |Pāṭaliputta::capital of Magadha, modern Patna|, at the Kukkuṭa's park. Then, in the evening, the venerable Bhadda, having arisen from seclusion, approached the venerable Ānanda. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Ānanda and, after engaging in a pleasant and friendly conversation, sat down to one side. After sitting down, the venerable Bhadda said this to the venerable Ānanda:

"Wrong spiritual practice, wrong spiritual practice," friend Ānanda, it is said. But what, friend, is the wrong spiritual practice?"

"Good, good, friend Bhadda. Your approach is good, your intuition is good, and your inquiry is good. For this is how you should ask: 'Wrong spiritual practice, wrong spiritual practice,' friend Ānanda, it is said. But what, friend, is the wrong spiritual practice?"

"Yes, friend." [venerable Bhadda replied]

"This, friend, is the wrong spiritual practice: the eightfold wrong way of practice, that is, wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong collectedness."
