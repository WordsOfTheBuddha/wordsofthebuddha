At Sāvatthi.

"Form, bhikkhus, is impermanent. What is impermanent is |suffering::discontentment, stress|; what is suffering is not self; what is not self should be seen with right understanding as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Thus, seeing this as it truly is with right understanding, one's mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by not clinging.

Feeling is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not self; what is not self should be seen with right understanding as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Thus, seeing this as it truly is with right understanding, one's mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by not clinging.

Perception is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not self; what is not self should be seen with right understanding as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Thus, seeing this as it truly is with right understanding, one's mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by not clinging.

Formations are impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not self; what is not self should be seen with right understanding as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Thus, seeing this as it truly is with right understanding, one's mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by not clinging.

Consciousness is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not self; what is not self should be seen with right understanding as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Thus, seeing this as it truly is with right understanding, one's mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by not clinging.

If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's mind is dispassionate towards the form element, liberated from the taints by not clinging, towards the feeling element... perception element... formations element... consciousness element, then his mind is dispassionate and liberated from the taints by not clinging.

Being liberated, one remains steadfast. Being steadfast, one is content. Being content, one does not fret. Without fretting, one personally attains complete Nibbāna.

'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence,' one understands."
