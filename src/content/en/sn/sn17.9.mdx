At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

High in the sky, bhikkhus, turbulent winds blow. If a bird goes up there, the turbulent winds hurl it about, and as it is thrown about by the turbulent winds, its feet go in one direction, its wings go in another direction, its head goes in another direction, and its body goes in yet another direction.

So too, bhikkhus, a certain bhikkhu here who is overwhelmed by acquisitions, respect, and popularity, with his mind consumed by them,  dresses in the morning, takes his alms bowl and outer robe, and enters a village or town for alms with body |unguarded::unprotected [arakkhita]|, speech unguarded, and mind unguarded, without setting up |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]|, |unrestrained::uncontrolled [asaṃvuta]| in his sense faculties. There he sees a woman who is scantily clothed or improperly covered. On seeing the woman who is scantily clothed or improperly covered, |lust::passion, infatuation, desire [rāga]| invades his mind. With his mind invaded by lust, he gives up the training and returns to the household life. Then some take his robe, others his bowl, others his sitting cloth, and still others his sewing kit, as with the bird that is thrown about by the turbulent winds.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity to continue |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
