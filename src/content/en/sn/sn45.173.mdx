"Bhikkhus, there are these four knots. What four? The knot of |craving::greediness, wanting, yearning [abhijjhā]|, the knot of |ill will::aversion, anger, contempt, resentment [byāpāda]|, the knot of |adherence to rules and observances::clinging to precepts and practices [sīlabbataparāmāsa]| the knot of |clinging to the idea that 'This is the truth'::dogmatic attachment to views [idaṃsaccābhinivesa]|. These are the four knots.

Bhikkhus, for the |direct knowing::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these four knots, the Noble Eightfold Path |should be developed::should be cultivated [bhāvetabba]|."
