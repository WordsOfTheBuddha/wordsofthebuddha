At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, have you heard an old jackal howling during the early hours of the night, at the break of dawn?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“Bhikkhus, that old jackal might possess some measure of |gratitude::thankfulness, appreciativeness [kataññutā]| or acknowledgement of what has been done for it. But some here, pretending to be followers of the |Sakyan son::an epithet of the Buddha as he went forth from the Sakyan clan [sakyaputtiyapaṭiñña]|, might not possess even a small measure of gratitude or acknowledgement for what has been done for them.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will be grateful and acknowledge what has been done for us; we will not be ungrateful and fail to acknowledge what has been done for us.’ Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
