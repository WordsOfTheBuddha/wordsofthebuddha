“Bhikkhus, whether for a layperson or |one gone forth::renunciant, ordained [pabbajita]|, I do not |praise::commend, extol [vaṇṇeti]| the |wrong way of practice:: [micchāpaṭipatti]|. For whether lay or ordained, one who follows a wrong course fails, because of that wrong practice, to succeed in the |approach::method, system [ñāya]| of the |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wrong way of practice? It is: |wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|, |wrong intention::wrong notions, wrong ideas [micchāsaṅkappa]|, |wrong speech::speech that is false, divisive, harsh, or frivolous; communication rooted in deceit, hostility, or heedlessness [micchāvācā]|, |wrong action::bodily conduct that causes harm—acts of killing, stealing, or sexual misconduct; behaviour contrary to harmlessness and restraint [micchākammanta]|, |wrong livelihood::earning a living or seeking support through deceitful or manipulative means—by cheating, flattery, hinting, disparaging others, or scheming for gain [micchāājīva]|, |wrong effort::energy directed toward unwholesome aims; striving that strengthens greed, hatred, and delusion [micchāvāyāma]|, |wrong mindfulness::attention distorted by craving and aversion; unwholesome recollection that reinforces delusion or distraction [micchāsati]|, and |wrong collectedness::mental composure based on wrong view and wrong intention; stability of mind used for unwholesome or deluded purposes [micchāsamādhi]|. This is called, bhikkhus, the wrong way of practice. Bhikkhus, whether for a layperson or one gone forth, I do not praise the wrong way of practice. For whether lay or ordained, one who follows a wrong course fails, because of that wrong practice, to succeed in the approach of the wholesome Dhamma.

Bhikkhus, whether for a layperson or one gone forth, I praise the |right way of practice::right path of action [sammāpaṭipadā]|. For whether lay or ordained, one who follows the right course succeeds, because of that right practice, to succeed in the approach of the wholesome Dhamma.

And what, bhikkhus, is the right way of practice? It is: |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is truthful, harmonious, gentle, and meaningful; abstaining from false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::mindfulness that discerns the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities clearly, grounded in diligent, non-forgetful attention to the present moment [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::perfect stability of mind, correct mental composure [sammāsamādhi]|. This is called, bhikkhus, the right way of practice. Bhikkhus, whether for a layperson or one gone forth, I praise the right way of practice. For whether lay or ordained, one who follows the right course succeeds, because of that right practice, to succeed in the approach of the wholesome Dhamma.”
