At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, have you heard the jackal howling during the early hours of the night, at the break of dawn?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"Bhikkhus, that jackal is afflicted with a disease called |mange::a type of skin disease caused by parasitic mites [ukkaṇḍaka]|. Wherever it wishes to go, it goes; wherever it wishes to stand, it stands; wherever it wishes to sit, it sits; and wherever it wishes to lie down, it lies down. And a cool breeze even blows upon him. It would be |fortunate::good [sādhu]|, bhikkhus, for a certain person here claiming to be a follower of the |Sakyan son::an epithet of the Buddha as he went forth from the Sakyan clan [sakyaputtiyapaṭiñña]| if he were to experience even |such a form of personal existence::acquisition of individual identity [attabhāvapaṭilābha]|.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will dwell |diligently::doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
