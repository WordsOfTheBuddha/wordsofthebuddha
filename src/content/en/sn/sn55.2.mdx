“Bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones who is endowed with four qualities becomes a stream-enterer, not liable to states of suffering, and destined for |enlightenment::Nibbāna|.

What four qualities? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with |perfect clarity::unshakable confidence that arises through direct experience, by personally seeing the benefits in one’s own practice [aveccappasāda]| in the Buddha: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is the Worthy One, perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One.’

He is endowed with perfect clarity in the teachings of the Buddha: ‘Indeed, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, |onward leading::applicable, relevant, practical [opaneyyika]|, to be personally experienced by the wise.’

He is endowed with perfect clarity in the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]|: ‘The community of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this community of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’

He is endowed with virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones—unbroken, untorn, not spotty, unblemished, freeing, praised by the wise, irreproachable, |leading to collectedness::leading to samadhi, conducive to mental composure [samādhisaṃvattanika]|.

Endowed with these four qualities, bhikkhus, a noble disciple becomes a stream-enterer, not liable to states of suffering, and destined for full awakening.”

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Accomplished One further said this:

“Those who have |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]| and |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]|,
|confidence::inspiration, faith, trust [pasāda]| and vision of the Dhamma;
they, in time, arrive at |contentment::ease, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]|,
immersed in the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| .”
