"Bhikkhus, a noble disciple who is endowed with four qualities becomes a stream-enterer, not liable to states of suffering, and destined for |enlightenment::Nibbāna|.

Which four qualities?

Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple is endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha, acknowledging: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is the Worthy One, perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One.'

He is endowed with experiential confidence in the teachings of the Buddha, acknowledging: 'Indeed, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, leading onward, to be personally experienced by the wise.'

He is endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha, acknowledging: 'Indeed, the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the knowledgeable way, practicing the proper way; these are the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals - this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.'

He is endowed with beloved noble virtues, unbroken, unblemished, unspotted, untarnished, leading to collectedness.

With these four qualities, bhikkhus, a noble disciple becomes a stream-enterer, not liable to states of suffering, and destined for enlightenment."

This was said by the Blessed One. Having said this, the Well-Gone teacher then said this:

"Those who have faith and virtue,
confidence and understanding of the teachings;
they, in time, find happiness,
immersed in the spiritual path."
