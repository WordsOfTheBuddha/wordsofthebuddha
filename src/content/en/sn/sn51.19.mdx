“Bhikkhus, I will teach you about psychic powers, the basis of psychic powers, the development of the bases of psychic powers, and the way of practice leading to the development of the bases of psychic powers. Listen to this.

And what, bhikkhus, are psychic powers? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu experiences various kinds of psychic powers—being one, one becomes many; being many, one becomes one; one appears and disappears; one passes through walls, enclosures, and mountains as though through space; one dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; one walks on water without sinking as though on solid ground; one flies through the air cross-legged like a bird with wings; one touches and strokes with one’s hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; and one wields mastery with the body even as far as the |Brahmā::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahmā]| world—this, bhikkhus, are called psychic powers.

And what, bhikkhus, is the basis of psychic powers? The path and practice that lead to the attainment of psychic powers—this, bhikkhus, is called the basis of psychic powers.

And what, bhikkhus, is the development of the bases of psychic powers? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic powers that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic powers that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort, and develops the basis of psychic powers that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic powers that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort—this, bhikkhus, is called the development of the bases of psychic powers.

And what, bhikkhus, is the way of practice leading to the development of the bases of psychic powers? It is this very Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness — this, bhikkhus, is called the way of practice leading to the development of the bases of psychic powers.”
