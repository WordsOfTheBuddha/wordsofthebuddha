"Bhikkhus, I will teach you about psychic abilities, the basis of psychic abilities, the development of the bases of psychic abilities, and the way of practice leading to the development of the bases of psychic abilities. Listen to this.

And what, bhikkhus, are psychic abilities? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu experiences various kinds of psychic abilities—being one, one becomes many; being many, one becomes one; one appears and disappears; one passes through walls, enclosures, and mountains as though through space; one dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; one walks on water without sinking as though on solid ground; one flies through the air cross-legged like a bird with wings; one touches and strokes with one's hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; and one controls the body as far as the |Brahmā::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahmā]| world—this, bhikkhus, are called psychic abilities.

And what, bhikkhus, is the basis of psychic abilities? The path and practice that lead to the attainment of psychic abilities—this, bhikkhus, is called the basis of psychic abilities.

And what, bhikkhus, is the development of the bases of psychic abilities? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic abilities that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic abilities that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort, and develops the basis of psychic abilities that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic abilities that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort—this, bhikkhus, is called the development of the bases of psychic abilities.

And what, bhikkhus, is the way of practice leading to the development of the bases of psychic abilities? It is this very Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness — this, bhikkhus, is called the way of practice leading to the development of the bases of psychic abilities."
