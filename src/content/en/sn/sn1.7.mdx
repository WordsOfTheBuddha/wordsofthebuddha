At Sāvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

“Those who have |not understood::not comprehended, not personally known [appaṭividitā]| the teachings,
are led by |others’ views::by another’s doctrine, by the philosophical beliefs of others [paravādesu]|;
They, being asleep, do not awaken,
though it is time for them to awaken.”

[The Blessed One]: “Those who have |well understood::fully perceived, thoroughly comprehended [suppaṭividitā = su + paṭividitā]| the teachings,
are not led by by others’ views;
They, awakened and |completely comprehending::fully understanding [sammadaññā]|,
fare |evenly::with balance, with peace, with tranquility [sama]| amidst the uneven.”
