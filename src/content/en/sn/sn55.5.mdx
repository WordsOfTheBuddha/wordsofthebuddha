Then indeed, the venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One. Having approached and paid respects, he sat down to one side.

Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said this to the venerable Sāriputta:

"'Factor of stream-entry, factor of stream-entry,' thus it is said, Sāriputta. What, indeed, Sāriputta, is the factor of stream-entry?"

"Associating with good persons indeed, venerable sir, is a factor of stream-entry. Hearing the true teaching is a factor of stream-entry. Wise |attention::and reflection| is a factor of stream-entry. Practice in accordance with the teaching is a factor of stream-entry."

"Good, good, Sāriputta. Indeed, associating with good persons, listening to the true teaching, wise attention, and practice in accordance with the teaching are factors of stream-entry."

"'Stream, stream,' thus it is said, Sāriputta. What, indeed, Sāriputta, is the stream?"

"Just this, venerable sir, is the stream, namely the Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right |collectedness::sammāsamādhi|."

"'Stream-enterer, stream-enterer,' thus it is said, Sāriputta. Who, indeed, Sāriputta, is the stream-enterer?"

"He who, venerable sir, is endowed with this Noble Eightfold Path is called a stream-enterer, this venerable one of such name and such family lineage."

"Good, good, Sāriputta. He who, Sāriputta, is endowed with this Noble Eightfold Path is called a stream-enterer, this venerable one of such name and such family lineage."
