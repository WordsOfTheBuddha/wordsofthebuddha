Then indeed, the venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near and paid respects, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said this to the venerable Sāriputta:

“'Factor of stream-entry, factor of stream-entry,’ thus it is said, Sāriputta. What, indeed, Sāriputta, is the factor of stream-entry?”

“Associating with good persons indeed, venerable sir, is a factor of stream-entry. Hearing the true teaching is a factor of stream-entry. |Wise attention::proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yoniso + manasikāra]| is a factor of stream-entry. Practice in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor of stream-entry.”

“Good, good, Sāriputta. Indeed, associating with good persons, listening to the true teaching, wise attention, and practice in accordance with the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| are factors of stream-entry.”

“'Stream, stream,’ thus it is said, Sāriputta. What, indeed, Sāriputta, is the stream?”

“Just this, venerable sir, is the stream, namely the Noble Eightfold Path — |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is truthful, harmonious, gentle, and meaningful; abstaining from false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::mindfulness that discerns the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities clearly, grounded in diligent, non-forgetful attention to the present moment [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::perfect stability of mind, correct mental composure [sammāsamādhi]|.”

“Good, good, Sāriputta. Just this is the stream, namely the Noble Eightfold Path — right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness.”

“'Stream-enterer, stream-enterer,’ thus it is said, Sāriputta. Who, indeed, Sāriputta, is the stream-enterer?”

“He who, venerable sir, is endowed with this Noble Eightfold Path is called a stream-enterer, this venerable one of such name and such family lineage.”

“Good, good, Sāriputta. He who, Sāriputta, is endowed with this Noble Eightfold Path is called a stream-enterer, this venerable one of such name and such family lineage.”
