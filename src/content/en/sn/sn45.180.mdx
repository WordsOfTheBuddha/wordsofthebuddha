“Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? 1) |Passion for worldly existence::desire for material existence [rūparāga]|, 2) |passion for formless existence::desire for non-material existence [arūparāga]|, 3) |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|, 4) |restlessness::mental agitation, distraction, excitement [uddhacca]|, and 5) |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|. These are the five higher fetters.

For the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these five higher fetters, the Noble Eightfold Path |should be cultivated::should be developed [bhāvetabbo]|. What is the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view |dependent on seclusion::supported by detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]|, |supported by dispassion::based on fading of desire [virāganissita]|, |based on ending::supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]|, |culminating in complete relinquishment::ripening in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]|; similarly he develops right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness, dependent on seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, culminating in complete relinquishment.

For the direct knowledge, full understanding, complete exhaustion, and for giving up of these five higher fetters, the Noble Eightfold Path should be cultivated.
