At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Bhikkhus, a |faithful::confident, believing, devoted, trusting [saddhā]| laywoman, imploring her |dear::beloved [piya]| and |pleasing::agreeable, likeable [manāpa]| only daughter, should rightly implore her thus: ‘Dear, you should become like the laywoman Khujjuttarā and Nandamātā from Veḷukaṇḍaka’—for, bhikkhus, this is the measure and standard for my female lay disciples, namely, the |laywoman Khujjuttarā::foremost female lay disciple among those who were very learned [khujjuttarā]| and |Nandamātā from Veḷukaṇḍaka::foremost female lay disciple of the Buddha, read about her in [AN 7.53 - Nandamātā sutta](/an7.53). [veḷukaṇḍakiyā]|.

‘But if, dear, you go forth from the household life into homelessness, then you should become like bhikkhunī Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā’—for, bhikkhus, this is the measure and standard for my bhikkhunī disciples, namely, bhikkhunī Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā.

‘May it not be, dear, that acquisitions, respect, and popularity come upon you while you are still a |trainee::learner, one of the seven stages of a noble person before full awakening [sekha]| whose mind has |not yet reached the goal::not mentally attained, not reached Arahantship [appattamānasa]|.’ If, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity come upon a trainee bhikkhunī whose mind has not yet reached the goal, that becomes an obstacle for her.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to |occupy::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
