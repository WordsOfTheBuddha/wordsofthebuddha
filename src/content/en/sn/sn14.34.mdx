At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, if the \{earth element} (whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]) were exclusively unpleasant, beset by suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]), filled with suffering, and if it were also not associated with ease (contentment, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]), beings would not be infatuated (enamoured, attracted [sārajjati]) with the earth element. But because, bhikkhus, the earth element is not exclusively unpleasant, not beset by suffering, not filled with suffering, and is also associated with ease, beings are infatuated with the earth element.

If the \{water element} (whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]) were exclusively unpleasant, beset by suffering, filled with suffering, and if it were also not associated with ease, beings would not be infatuated with the water element. But because, bhikkhus, the water element is not exclusively unpleasant, not beset by suffering, not filled with suffering, and is also associated with ease, beings are infatuated with the water element.

If the \{fire element} (whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]) were exclusively unpleasant, beset by suffering, filled with suffering, and if it were also not associated with ease, beings would not be infatuated with the fire element. But because, bhikkhus, the fire element is not exclusively unpleasant, not beset by suffering, not filled with suffering, and is also associated with ease, beings are infatuated with the fire element.

If the \{air element} (whatever internal or external that is airy, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [vāyodhātu]) were exclusively unpleasant, beset by suffering, filled with suffering, and if it were also not associated with ease, beings would not be infatuated with the air element. But because, bhikkhus, the air element is not exclusively unpleasant, not beset by suffering, not filled with suffering, and is also associated with ease, beings are infatuated with the air element.

Bhikkhus, if the earth element were \{exclusively pleasurable} (completely comfortable, totally happy, perfectly at ease [ekantasukha]), steeped in pleasure, filled with comfort, and also not associated with suffering, beings would not become \{disenchanted with} (disillusioned with [nibbindati]) the earth element. But because the earth element is not exclusively pleasurable, not steeped in pleasure, not filled with comfort, and is also associated with suffering, beings become disenchanted with the earth element.

If the water element were exclusively pleasurable, steeped in pleasure, filled with comfort, and also not associated with suffering, beings would not become disenchanted with the water element. But because the water element is not exclusively pleasurable, not steeped in pleasure, not filled with comfort, and is also associated with suffering, beings become disenchanted with the water element.

If the fire element were exclusively pleasurable, steeped in pleasure, filled with comfort, and also not associated with suffering, beings would not become disenchanted with the fire element. But because the fire element is not exclusively pleasurable, not steeped in pleasure, not filled with comfort, and is also associated with suffering, beings become disenchanted with the fire element.

If the air element were exclusively pleasurable, steeped in pleasure, filled with comfort, and also not associated with suffering, beings would not become disenchanted with the air element. But because the air element is not exclusively pleasurable, not steeped in pleasure, not filled with comfort, and is also associated with suffering, beings become disenchanted with the air element."
