"I will teach you, bhikkhus, about the ultimate goal and the way of practice leading to the ultimate goal. Listen to this.

And what, bhikkhus, is the ultimate goal? It is the ending of |desire::passion, infatuation, lust [rāga]|, the ending of |aversion::ill-will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]|, the ending of |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]| — this, bhikkhus, is called the ultimate goal.

And what, bhikkhus, is the way of practice leading to the ultimate goal? It is mindfulness of the body. This, bhikkhus, is called the way of practice leading to the ultimate goal.

Thus, bhikkhus, I have taught you the ultimate goal and the way of practice leading to the ultimate goal. What a teacher should do out of compassion for the welfare of the disciples, considering their benefit and out of compassion, that I have done for you. Here are the roots of trees, here are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be negligent; lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you."
