At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Here, bhikkhus, I see a certain individual |overwhelmed::overcome, overpowered [abhibhūta]| by respect, with his mind |consumed::obsessed, controlled [pariyādiṇṇa]| by it, who after the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn |in a state of loss::in a state of misery [apāya]|, in a bad destination, in the |realms of downfall::in realms of misery [vinipāta]|, in hell.

Here, bhikkhus, I see a certain individual overwhelmed by |disrespect::disregard [asakkārena]|, with his mind consumed by it, who after the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in a state of loss, in the lower realms, in hell.

Here, bhikkhus, I see a certain individual overwhelmed by both respect and disrespect, with his mind consumed by them, who after the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in a state of loss, in the lower realms, in hell.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to |occupy::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Well-Gone One further said this:

"While being honored,
or shown dishonor, or by both;
For one whose |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| does not waver,
as he dwells with a boundless mind —

That one, meditative and |practicing continuously::diligent, persevering, consistent [sātatika]|,
refined in vision and insight;
Delighting in the ending of grasping,
is called a |true person::good person, worthy one, awakened being [sappurisa]|."
