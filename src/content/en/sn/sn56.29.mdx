"Bhikkhus, there are these four noble truths. What four? The Noble Truth of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, the Noble Truth of the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|, the Noble Truth of the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|, the Noble Truth of the |way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|. These, bhikkhus are the Four Noble Truths.

Bhikkhus, regarding these Four Noble Truths, there is a Noble Truth that |should be fully understood::should be completely comprehended [pariññeyya]|, a Noble Truth that |should be abandoned::should be given up [pahātabba]|, a Noble Truth that |should be personally experienced::should be personally realized [sacchikātabba]|, and a Noble Truth that |should be developed::should be cultivated [bhāvetabba]|.

And what bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth that should be fully understood? It is the Noble Truth of suffering, bhikkhus, that should be fully understood. What is the Noble Truth that should be abandoned? It is the Noble Truth of the arising of suffering that should be abandoned. What is the Noble Truth should be realized? It is the Noble Truth of the ending of suffering that should be realized. What is the Noble Truth that should be developed? It is the Noble Truth of the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering that should be developed.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to |fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'""
