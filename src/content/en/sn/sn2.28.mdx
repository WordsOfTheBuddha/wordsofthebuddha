Standing to one side, the young deity Nandivisāla recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

“Having four postures and nine openings,
filled up and bound with |greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]|;
Born from defilement, O great hero!
how does one escape from it?”

“Having cut the |strap::thong, a metaphor for grudge [naddhi]| and |harness::a metaphor for craving [varatta]|,
having cut off |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| |longings::wishes, desires [icchā]| and greed;
Uprooting craving at its root,
this is how one escapes from it.”
