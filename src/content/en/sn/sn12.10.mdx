“Bhikkhus, even before my awakening, while I was still only a |Bodhisatta::Buddha before his awakening, aspirant Buddha [bodhisatta]|, the thought occurred to me: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into |trouble::difficulty, problem [kiccha]|, in that it is born, ages, and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, from aging and death. When indeed will the escape from this suffering, from aging and death, be known?'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to aging and death? Dependent on what does aging and death arise?' Then, through |wise attention::proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yoniso + manasikāra]|, insight arose in me with this |breakthrough::complete comprehension, total understanding [abhisamaya]|: ‘When |birth::rebirth, conception, coming into existence [jāti]| is present, aging and death arise; dependent on birth, aging and death arise.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to birth? Dependent on what does birth arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |existence::being, becoming; continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]| is present, it leads to birth; dependent on existence, birth arises.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to existence? Dependent on what does existence arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |clinging::grasping, acquiring, appropriating, taking possession, identifying; fuel for fire; lit. taking near [upādāna]| is present, it leads to existence; dependent on clinging, existence arises.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to clinging? Dependent on what does clinging arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇhā]| is present, it leads to clinging; dependent on craving, clinging arises.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to craving? Dependent on what does craving arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| is present, it leads to craving; dependent on felt experience, craving arises.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to felt experience? Dependent on what does felt experience arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |contact::sense impingement, raw experience, touch [phassa]| is present, it leads to felt experience; dependent on contact, felt experience arises.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to contact? Dependent on what does contact arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When the |six sense bases::The six internal sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—are the faculties that enable sensory contact and experience. They are not the physical organs themselves, but the functional conditions that enable consciousness to meet an object [saḷāyatana]| are present, it leads to contact; dependent on the six sense bases, contact arises.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to the six sense bases? Dependent on what do the six sense bases arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |name and form::mentality and materiality—the integrated structure of mental capacities (intention, attention, contact, feeling, perception) and physical form that together constitute and sustain an individual being [nāmarūpa]| are present, it leads to the six sense bases; dependent on name and form, the six sense bases arise.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to name and form? Dependent on what do name and form arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]| is present, it leads to name and form; dependent on consciousness, name and form arise.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to consciousness? Dependent on what does consciousness arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |intentional constructs::the constructive activity that shapes each moment of experience, expressed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations; the accumulated conditioning — patterns, tendencies, and habits — produced by prior action [saṅkhāra]| are present, it leads to consciousness; dependent on intentional constructs, consciousness arises.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when present, leads to intentional constructs? Dependent on what do intentional constructs arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]| is present, it leads to intentional constructs; dependent on ignorance, intentional constructs arise.’

Thus, dependent on ignorance, intentional constructs [arise]; dependent on intentional constructs, consciousness arises; dependent on consciousness, name and form arise; dependent on name and form, the six sense bases arise; dependent on the six sense bases, contact arises; dependent on contact, felt experience arises; dependent on felt experience, craving arises; dependent on craving, clinging arises; dependent on clinging, existence arises; dependent on existence, birth arises; dependent on birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering. ‘Arising, arising,’ bhikkhus, vision, insight, wisdom, true knowledge, and clarity arose in me concerning |doctrine::tradition, discourses, teachings [dhammesu]| previously unheard of.

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to aging and death not arising? With the ending of what do aging and death cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When birth is absent, aging and death do not arise; with the ending of birth, aging and death cease.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to birth not arising? With the ending of what does birth cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When existence is absent, birth does not arise; with the ending of existence, birth ceases.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to existence not arising? With the ending of what does existence cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When clinging is absent, existence does not arise; with the ending of clinging, existence ceases.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to clinging not arising? With the ending of what does clinging cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When craving is absent, clinging does not arise; with the ending of craving, clinging ceases.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to craving not arising? With the ending of what does craving cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When felt experience is absent, craving does not arise; with the ending of felt experience, craving ceases.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to felt experience not arising? With the ending of what does felt experience cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When contact is absent, felt experience does not arise; with the ending of contact, felt experience ceases.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to contact not arising? With the ending of what does contact cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When the six sense bases are absent, contact does not arise; with the ending of the six sense bases, contact ceases.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to the six sense bases not arising? With the ending of what do the six sense bases cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When name and form are absent, the six sense bases do not arise; with the ending of name and form, the six sense bases cease.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to name and form not arising? With the ending of what do name and form cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When consciousness is absent, name and form do not arise; with the ending of consciousness, name and form cease.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to consciousness not arising? With the ending of what does consciousness cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When intentional constructs are absent, consciousness does not arise; with the ending of intentional constructs, consciousness ceases.’

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: ‘What is it that, when absent, leads to intentional constructs not arising? With the ending of what do intentional constructs cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: ‘When ignorance is absent, intentional constructs do not arise; with the ending of ignorance, intentional constructs cease.’

Thus, with the ending of ignorance, intentional constructs cease; with the ending of intentional constructs, consciousness ceases; with the ending of consciousness, name and form cease; with the ending of name and form, the six sense bases cease; with the ending of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the ending of contact, felt experience ceases; with the ending of felt experience, craving ceases; with the ending of craving, clinging ceases; with the ending of clinging, existence ceases; with the ending of existence, birth ceases; with the ending of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus is the ending of this whole mass of suffering. ‘Ending, ending,’ bhikkhus, vision, insight, wisdom, true knowledge, and clarity arose in me concerning doctrine previously unheard of.”
