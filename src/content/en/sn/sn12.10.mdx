"Bhikkhus, even before my awakening, while I was still only a |bodhisatta::Buddha before his awakening, aspirant Buddha [bodhisatta]|, the thought occurred to me: 'Alas, this world has fallen into |trouble::difficulty, problem [kiccha]|, in that it is born, ages, and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, from aging and death. When indeed will the escape from this suffering, from aging and death, be known?'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to aging and death? Dependent on what does aging and death arise?' Then, through |wise attention::proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yoniso + manasikāra]|, insight arose in me with this |breakthrough::complete comprehension, total understanding [abhisamaya]|: 'When |birth::rebirth, conception, coming into existence [jāti]| is present, aging and death arise; dependent on birth, aging and death arise.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to birth? Dependent on what does birth arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |existence::being, becoming [bhava]| is present, it leads to birth; dependent on existence, birth arises.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to existence? Dependent on what does existence arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |clinging::grasping, acquiring, appropriating, taking possession, identifying [upādāna]| is present, it leads to existence; dependent on clinging, existence arises.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to clinging? Dependent on what does clinging arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇhā]| is present, it leads to clinging; dependent on craving, clinging arises.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to craving? Dependent on what does craving arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |sensation::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| is present, it leads to craving; dependent on sensation, craving arises.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to sensation? Dependent on what does sensation arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |contact::sense impingement, raw experience, touch [phassa]| is present, it leads to sensation; dependent on contact, sensation arises.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to contact? Dependent on what does contact arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When the |six sense bases::the six internal sense faculties - eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind - that enable sensory experience [saḷāyatana]| are present, it leads to contact; dependent on the six sense bases, contact arises.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to the six sense bases? Dependent on what do the six sense bases arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |name and form::combination of mental processes [intending, attention, contact, sensation, and perceiving] and physical form that constitute an individual being, the mental and physical objects of consciousness [nāmarūpa]| are present, it leads to the six sense bases; dependent on name and form, the six sense bases arise.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to name and form? Dependent on what do name and form arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |consciousness::quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind] [viññāṇa]| is present, it leads to name and form; dependent on consciousness, name and form arise.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to consciousness? Dependent on what does consciousness arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |volitional formations::intentions, choices, decisions, karmic activity [saṅkhāra]| are present, it leads to consciousness; dependent on volitional formations, consciousness arises.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when present, leads to volitional formations? Dependent on what do volitional formations arise?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]| is present, it leads to volitional formations; dependent on ignorance, volitional formations arise.'

Thus, dependent on ignorance, volitional formations [arise]; dependent on volitional formations, consciousness arises; dependent on consciousness, name and form arise; dependent on name and form, the six sense bases arise; dependent on the six sense bases, contact arises; dependent on contact, sensation arises; dependent on sensation, craving arises; dependent on craving, clinging arises; dependent on clinging, existence arises; dependent on existence, birth arises; dependent on birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering. 'Arising, arising,' bhikkhus, vision, insight, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me concerning |doctrine::tradition, discourses, teachings [dhammesu]| previously unheard of.

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to aging and death not arising? With the ending of what do aging and death cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When birth is absent, aging and death do not arise; with the ending of birth, aging and death cease.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to birth not arising? With the ending of what does birth cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When existence is absent, birth does not arise; with the ending of existence, birth ceases.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to existence not arising? With the ending of what does existence cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When clinging is absent, existence does not arise; with the ending of clinging, existence ceases.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to clinging not arising? With the ending of what does clinging cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When craving is absent, clinging does not arise; with the ending of craving, clinging ceases.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to craving not arising? With the ending of what does craving cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When sensation is absent, craving does not arise; with the ending of sensation, craving ceases.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to sensation not arising? With the ending of what does sensation cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When contact is absent, sensation does not arise; with the ending of contact, sensation ceases.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to contact not arising? With the ending of what does contact cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When the six sense bases are absent, contact does not arise; with the ending of the six sense bases, contact ceases.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to the six sense bases not arising? With the ending of what do the six sense bases cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When name and form are absent, the six sense bases do not arise; with the ending of name and form, the six sense bases cease.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to name and form not arising? With the ending of what do name and form cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When consciousness is absent, name and form do not arise; with the ending of consciousness, name and form cease.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to consciousness not arising? With the ending of what does consciousness cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When volitional formations are absent, consciousness does not arise; with the ending of volitional formations, consciousness ceases.'

Then, bhikkhus, the thought occurred to me: 'What is it that, when absent, leads to volitional formations not arising? With the ending of what do volitional formations cease?' Then, through wise attention, insight arose in me with this breakthrough: 'When ignorance is absent, volitional formations do not arise; with the ending of ignorance, volitional formations cease.'

Thus, with the ending of ignorance, volitional formations cease; with the ending of volitional formations, consciousness ceases; with the ending of consciousness, name and form cease; with the ending of name and form, the six sense bases cease; with the ending of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the ending of contact, sensation ceases; with the ending of sensation, craving ceases; with the ending of craving, clinging ceases; with the ending of clinging, existence ceases; with the ending of existence, birth ceases; with the ending of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus is the ending of this whole mass of suffering. 'Ending, ending,' bhikkhus, vision, insight, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me concerning doctrine previously unheard of."
