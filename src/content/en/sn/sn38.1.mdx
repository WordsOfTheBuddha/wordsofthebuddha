Once, the venerable Sāriputta was dwelling in the Magadhan lands, in the village of Nālaka. Then, the wanderer Jambukhādaka approached the venerable Sāriputta. After approaching, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta. After the exchange of courteous and polite conversation, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the wanderer Jambukhādaka said to the venerable Sāriputta:

“'Nibbāna, Nibbāna,’ it is said, friend Sāriputta. But what, friend, is |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|?”

“Friend, the |wearing away of passion::exhaustion of intense desire, ending of strong emotions, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāgakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of aversion::ending of ill will, extinction of hatred [dosakkhaya]|, the |wearing away of delusion::wearing away of illusion, ending of hallucination, ending of misperceptions and distorted views [mohakkhaya]|—this is called  Nibbāna.”

“Is there, friend, a path, is there a way for the realization of this Nibbāna?”

“There is, friend, a path, there is a way for the realization of this Nibbāna.”

“What, friend, is the path, what is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna?”

“Friend, this Noble Eightfold Path itself is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna, namely — |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, |right intention::intention of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness; the resolve to let go of craving, ill will, and cruelty, cultivating thoughts that lead to peace and liberation [sammāsaṅkappa]|, |right speech::speech that is truthful, harmonious, gentle, and meaningful; abstaining from false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter [sammāvācā]|, |right action::action that upholds ethical integrity by abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; bodily conduct aligned with harmlessness and honesty [sammākammanta]|, |right livelihood::means of living that does not cause harm to others or oneself; earning a living ethically without deceit, exploitation, or violence [sammāājīva]|, |right effort::energy and effort directed toward abandoning unwholesome mental states and qualities, and cultivating wholesome ones [sammāvāyāma]|, |right mindfulness::mindfulness that discerns the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities clearly, grounded in diligent, non-forgetful attention to the present moment [sammāsati]|, and |right collectedness::perfect stability of mind, correct mental composure [sammāsamādhi]|. This, friend, is the path, this is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna.”

“|Auspicious::fine, excellent [bhaddaka]|, friend, is the path, auspicious is the way for the realization of this Nibbāna. And it is enough, friend Sāriputta, for [arousing] |diligence::quality of wishing to do one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]|.”
