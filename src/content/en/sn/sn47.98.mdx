“Bhikkhus, there are these four knots. What four? 1) The knot of |craving::greediness, wanting, yearning [abhijjhā]|, 2) the knot of |ill will::intentional act of mentally opposing or rejecting others; an intentional construction fueled by aversion, directed against kindness or compassion. It manifests as hostility of will, impeding goodwill and fostering internal or external conflict. [byāpāda]|, 3) the knot of |clinging to rules and observances::clinging to precepts and practices, adherence to rites and rituals [sīlabbataparāmāsa]|, and 4) the knot of |clinging to the idea that ‘This is the truth’::dogmatic attachment to views [idaṃsaccābhinivesa]|. These are the four knots.

Bhikkhus, for the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these four knots, the four establishments of mindfulness |should be cultivated::should be developed [bhāvetabba]|.”
