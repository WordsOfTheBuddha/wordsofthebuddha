“Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? 1) |Passion for worldly existence::desire for material existence [rūparāga]|, 2) |passion for formless existence::desire for non-material existence [arūparāga]|, 3) |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|, 4) |restlessness::mental agitation, distraction, excitement [uddhacca]|, and 5) |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|. These are the five higher fetters.

Bhikkhus, for the |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, |full understanding::complete comprehension [pariññāya]|, |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]|, and for |giving up::letting go, abandoning [pahāna]| of these four floods, the four establishments of mindfulness |should be cultivated::should be developed [bhāvetabba]|.

What are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed |craving and distress::greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]| with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the mind in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world;

he dwells observing the |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and distress with regard to the world.

For the direct knowledge, full understanding, complete exhaustion, and for giving up of these five higher fetters, the four establishments of mindfulness should be cultivated.”
