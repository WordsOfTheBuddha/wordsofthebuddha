At Sāvatthi.

“I will teach you, bhikkhus, about |dependent co-arising::arising together from a cause, chain of causation, dependent origination [paṭiccasamuppāda]| and the phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

“And what, bhikkhus, is dependent co-arising? With dependence on birth, bhikkhus, there is aging and death. Whether or not there is the arising of Tathāgatas, this principle remains — this stability of |phenomena::characteristics, thoughts, mental states, mental qualities [dhammā]|, this invariance of phenomena, this |general law of conditionality::actuality of dependence [idappaccayatā]|. This, a Tathāgata |awakens to::realises, discovers [abhisambujjhati]| and |breaks through to::fully understands [abhisameti]|. Having fully awakened to and broken through to it, he points it out, teaches it, declares it, establishes it, clarifies it, analyzes it, and reveals it. And he says: ‘See, bhikkhus, with dependence on birth, there is aging and death.’

With dependence on existence, there is birth ... with dependence on clinging, there is existence ... with dependence on craving, there is clinging ... with dependence on sensation, there is craving ... with dependence on contact, there is felt experience ... with dependence on the six sense bases, there is contact ... with dependence on name and form, there are the six sense bases ... with dependence on consciousness, there is name and form ... with dependence on intentional constructs, there is consciousness ... with dependence on ignorance, there are intentional constructs. Whether or not there is the arising of Tathāgatas, this principle remains — this stability of phenomena, this invariance of phenomena, this dependence. This, a Tathāgata awakens to and breaks through to. Having fully awakened to and broken through to it, he points it out, teaches it, declares it, establishes it, clarifies it, analyzes it, and reveals it. And he says: ‘See, bhikkhus, with dependence on ignorance, there are intentional constructs.’ Thus, bhikkhus, the |actuality::reality, suchness [tathatā]| in this, the invariability, the |not-otherwiseness::absolute certainty [anaññathatā]| in dependence — this is called dependent co-arising.

And what, bhikkhus, are the phenomena that arise through dependent co-arising? Aging and death, bhikkhus, are |impermanent::unstable, transient, unreliable [anicca]|, |conditioned::constructed, created, fabricated [saṅkhata]|, dependently arisen, subject to |wearing away::exhaustion, depletion, gradual destruction [khaya]|, liable to |disintegrate::disappearance, dissolution, vanishing [vaya]|, subject to fading away and subject to |gradual ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]|.

|Birth::rebirth, conception, coming into existence [jāti]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subjecting to ending.

|Clinging::grasping, acquiring, appropriating, taking possession, identifying [upādāna]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|Craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|Felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|Contact::sense impingement, raw experience, touch [phassa]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

The |six sense bases::The six internal sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—are the faculties that enable sensory contact and experience. They are not the physical organs themselves, but the functional conditions that enable consciousness to meet an object [saḷāyatana]|, bhikkhus, are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|name and form::mentality and materiality—the integrated structure of mental capacities (intention, attention, contact, feeling, perception) and physical form that together constitute and sustain an individual being [nāmarūpa]|, bhikkhus, are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|intentional constructs::intentions, decisions, choices, volitional activities, constructed experiences, production of kamma [saṅkhāra]|, bhikkhus, are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending.

|Ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to wearing away, liable to disintegrate, subject to fading away and subject to ending. These are called, bhikkhus, the phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising.

Bhikkhus, when a noble disciple has thoroughly seen with |right wisdom::with correct distinctive knowledge [sammappaññāya]|, |as it truly is::as it has come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|, ‘This is dependent co-arising, and these are the phenomena arising from dependent co-arising,’ they will no longer run back to the past, wondering, ‘Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?' Nor will they run forward to the future, wondering, ‘Will I be in the future? Will I not be in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? Having become what, what will I be in the future?' Nor will they be inwardly |doubtful::perplexed [kathaṅkathī]| about the present, wondering, ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from, and where will it go?'

For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, a noble disciple has thoroughly seen with right wisdom, as it truly is, ‘This is dependent co-arising, and these are the phenomena arising from dependent co-arising.’"
