At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at |Vesāli::capital of the Licchavīs [vesālī]|, in the |Great Forest::name of a forest outside Vesāli; lit. great forest [mahāvana]|, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time the venerable Anurādha was dwelling in a little forest hut not far from the Blessed One. Then a number of wanderers of other sects approached the venerable Anurādha. Having approached, they exchanged friendly greetings with the venerable Anurādha. After the exchange of courteous and polite conversation, they sat down to one side. Sitting there, those wanderers of other sects said to the venerable Anurādha:

“Friend Anurādha, when a |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]| is describing a Tathāgata — a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who has reached the ultimate goal — does he describe him in terms of these four cases: ‘After death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’?”

When this was said, the venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers of other sects:

“Friends, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata, a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who has reached the ultimate goal, he describes him apart from these four cases: ‘After death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’” When this was said, those wanderers of other sects said to the venerable Anurādha:

“This bhikkhu must be recently ordained, not long gone forth, or else an elder who is foolish and incompetent.” Then those wanderers of other sects, having disparaged the venerable Anurādha by calling him recently ordained and a fool, rose from their seats and left.

Then, soon after those wanderers of other sects had left, it occurred to the venerable Anurādha:

“If those wanderers of other sects were to ask me a further question, how should I answer them so that I would state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact; so that I would explain in accordance with the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, and no reasonable consequence of my statement would afford grounds for criticism?”

Then the venerable Anurādha approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the venerable Anurādha said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, I am dwelling in a little forest hut not far from the Blessed One. Then, venerable sir, a number of wanderers of other sects approached me, and having approached, they said this to me: ‘Friend Anurādha, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata, a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who has reached the ultimate goal, does he describe him in terms of these four cases: “After death, a Tathāgata exists,” or “after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,” or “after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,” or “after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist?”’

When this was said, venerable sir, I said to those wanderers of other sects: “Friends, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata, a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who has reached the ultimate goal, he describes him apart from these four cases: ‘After death, a Tathāgata exists,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ or ‘after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’” When this was said, venerable sir, those wanderers of other sects said to me: “This bhikkhu must be recently ordained, not long gone forth, or else an elder who is foolish and incompetent.” Then those wanderers of other sects, having disparaged me by calling me recently ordained and a fool, rose from their seats and left.

Then, venerable sir, soon after those wanderers of other sects had left, it occurred to me: ‘If those wanderers of other sects were to ask me a further question, how should I answer them so that I would state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact; so that I would explain in accordance with the Dhamma, and no reasonable consequence of my statement would afford grounds for criticism?’”

“What do you think, Anurādha? Is |form::a visible object such as a beautiful sight, a face, an expression, art, ornament, possession, status symbol, admired appearance, or enticing scenery—anything seen that can produce desire, attachment, or self-view [rūpa]| |permanent::stable, not in flux [nicca]| or |impermanent::not lasting, transient, unreliable [anicca]|?”

“Impermanent, venerable sir.”

“And that which is impermanent—is it |unsatisfactory::uncomfortable, unpleasant [dukkha]| or |pleasant::comfortable, easy, good [sukha]|?”

“Unsatisfactory, venerable sir.”

“And that which is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and |subject to change::of the nature of alteration, decay [vipariṇāmadhamma]|—is it fitting to regard that as: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Are |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling, second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks sensory information by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, |intentional constructs::the constructive activity that shapes each moment of experience, expressed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations; the accumulated conditioning — patterns, tendencies, and habits — produced by prior action [saṅkhāra]|, and |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object [viññāṇa]| permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent, venerable sir.” <collapse>“And that which is impermanent—is it unsatisfactory or pleasant?” “Unsatisfactory, venerable sir.” “And that which is impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change—is it fitting to regard that as: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?” “No, venerable sir.”</collapse> “Therefore, <collapse>Anurādha, any kind of form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, consciousness, whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, deficient or refined, far or near—all form is to be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Seeing thus, Anurādha, the learned disciple of the Noble Ones becomes disenchanted with form, becomes disenchanted with felt experience, becomes disenchanted with perception, becomes disenchanted with intentional constructs, becomes disenchanted with consciousness. Experiencing disenchantment, they become dispassionate; through dispassion, there is release. When released, there arises the knowledge: ‘Released.’ He</collapse> understands: ‘Birth is ended, the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]| has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.’”

“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard form as the Tathāgata?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Do you regard felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, consciousness as the Tathāgata?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as in form?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Do you regard the Tathāgata as in felt experience? As apart from felt experience? As in perception? As apart from perception? As in intentional constructs? As apart from intentional constructs? As in consciousness? As apart from consciousness?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the form, felt experience, perception, intentional constructs, consciousness [taken together] as the Tathāgata?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as one who is without form, without felt experience, without perception, without intentional constructs, without consciousness?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“But here, Anurādha, when a Tathāgata is not to be apprehended by you as real and actual in this very life, is it fitting for you to declare: ‘Friends, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata, a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who has reached the ultimate goal, he describes him apart from these four cases: “After death, a Tathāgata exists,” or “after death, a Tathāgata does not exist,” or “after death, a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,” or “after death, a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist”’?”

“No, venerable sir.”

“Good, good, Anurādha! Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I make known just |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| and the |end of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|.”
