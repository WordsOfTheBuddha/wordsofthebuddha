“Bhikkhus, I will explain to you the arising of |anxiety through clinging::agitation through grasping, turmoil by holding on, nervousness arising from attachment [upādāparitassana]| and the freedom from anxiety through non-clinging. Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

### Uninstructed Ordinary Person

“Bhikkhus, how does anxiety due to clinging arise? Here, an uninstructed ordinary person—one who has no regard for the Noble Ones, and is unskilled and untrained in the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| of the Noble Ones, who has no regard for the |persons of integrity::good persons, worthy ones [sappurisā]|, and is unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma of the persons of integrity—perceives |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one’s body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]| as self, or self as possessing form, or form as existing in the self, or self as existing in form. That form then changes and becomes otherwise. As that form changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness is carried along by the change of form. As their consciousness becomes entangled with the changing form, anxiety and mental disturbance arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. When the mind is overwhelmed, they become |agitated::alarmed, fearful [uttāsavant]|, |distressed::afflicted or frustrated with [vighātavant]|, and |consumed by longing::full of longing or desire [apekkhava]|. Thus, by clinging, this person experiences anxiety.

This person perceives |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| as self, or self as possessing felt experience, or felt experience as existing in the self, or self as existing in felt experience. That felt experience then changes and becomes otherwise. As that felt experience changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness is carried along by the change of felt experience. As their consciousness becomes entangled with the changing felt experience, anxiety and mental disturbance arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. When the mind is overwhelmed, they become agitated, distressed, and consumed by longing. Thus, by clinging, this person experiences anxiety.

This person perceives |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks things by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]| as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as existing in the self, or self as existing in perception. That perception then changes and becomes otherwise. As that perception changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness is carried along by the change of perception. As their consciousness becomes entangled with the changing perception, anxiety and mental disturbance arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. When the mind is overwhelmed, they become agitated, distressed, and consumed by longing. Thus, by clinging, this person experiences anxiety.

This person perceives |intentional constructs::intentions, volitions, choices; mental and bodily volitional activities; thought formations and constructed experiences (including proliferative tendencies); kamma-producing processes; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]| as self, or self as possessing intentional constructs, or intentional constructs as existing in the self, or self as existing in intentional constructs. Those intentional constructs then change and become otherwise. As those intentional constructs change and become otherwise, their consciousness is carried along by the change of intentional constructs. As their consciousness becomes entangled with the changing intentional constructs, anxiety and mental disturbance arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. When the mind is overwhelmed, they become agitated, distressed, and consumed by longing. Thus, by clinging, this person experiences anxiety.

This person perceives |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]| as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as existing in the self, or self as existing in consciousness. That consciousness then changes and becomes otherwise. As that consciousness changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness is carried along by the change of consciousness. As their consciousness becomes entangled with the changing consciousness, anxiety and mental disturbance arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. When the mind is overwhelmed, they become agitated, distressed, and consumed by longing. Thus, by clinging, this person experiences anxiety.

This is how, bhikkhus, anxiety arises through clinging.”

### Noble Disciple

“And how, bhikkhus, is there freedom from anxiety through non-clinging? Here, bhikkhus, a well-instructed noble disciple—one who has regard for the Noble Ones, and is skilled and trained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones, who has regard for the persons of integrity, and is skilled and trained in the Dhamma of the persons of integrity—does not perceive form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as existing in the self, or self as existing in form. When that form changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness does not follow after the change of form. Because consciousness does not become entangled with the change of form, anxiety and mental disturbance do not arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. Since the mind is not seized, they are neither agitated, distressed, nor consumed by longing. Being free from clinging, they do not experience anxiety.

They do not perceive felt experience as self, or self as possessing felt experience, or felt experience as existing in the self, or self as existing in felt experience. When that felt experience changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness does not follow after the change of felt experience. Because consciousness does not become entangled with the change of felt experience, anxiety and mental disturbance do not arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. Since the mind is not seized, they are neither agitated, distressed, nor consumed by longing. Being free from clinging, they do not experience anxiety.

They do not perceive perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as existing in the self, or self as existing in perception. When that perception changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness does not follow after the change of perception. Because consciousness does not become entangled with the change of perception, anxiety and mental disturbance do not arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. Since the mind is not seized, they are neither agitated, distressed, nor consumed by longing. Being free from clinging, they do not experience anxiety.

They do not perceive intentional constructs as self, or self as possessing intentional constructs, or intentional constructs as existing in the self, or self as existing in intentional constructs. When those intentional constructs change and become otherwise, their consciousness does not follow after the change of intentional constructs. Because consciousness does not become entangled with the change of intentional constructs, anxiety and mental disturbance do not arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. Since the mind is not seized, they are neither agitated, distressed, nor consumed by longing. Being free from clinging, they do not experience anxiety.

They do not perceive consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as existing in the self, or self as existing in consciousness. When that consciousness changes and becomes otherwise, their consciousness does not follow after the change of consciousness. Because consciousness does not become entangled with the change of consciousness, anxiety and mental disturbance do not arise, seizing and overwhelming the mind. Since the mind is not seized, they are neither agitated, distressed, nor consumed by longing. Being free from clinging, they do not experience anxiety.

This is how, bhikkhus, there is freedom from anxiety through non-clinging.”
