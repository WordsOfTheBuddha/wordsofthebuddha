“Bhikkhus, |without directly knowing::not knowing for oneself [anabhijānanta]| and |without fully understanding::not completely comprehending [aparijānanta]| |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one’s body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]|, |without becoming dispassionate::without experiencing fading of desire [avirājayanta]| towards it and without abandoning it, one is incapable of achieving the |complete end of suffering::extinction of stress, complete wearing away of discontentment [dukkhakkhaya]|;

without directly knowing and without fully understanding |felt experience::pleasant, neutral, or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, without becoming dispassionate towards it and without abandoning it, one is incapable of achieving the complete end of suffering;

without directly knowing and without fully understanding |perception::The mental process of recognizing and giving meaning to experience. It marks sensory information by signs, labels, or associations drawn from memory and the field of contact. Perception shapes how one experiences the world; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, without becoming dispassionate towards it and without abandoning it, one is incapable of achieving the complete end of suffering;

without directly knowing and without fully understanding |consciousness::quality of awareness — distinctive knowing that arises in dependence on the meeting of eye and form, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and taste, body and tangible object, mind and mind object; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]|, without becoming dispassionate towards it and without abandoning it, one is incapable of achieving.

Indeed, bhikkhus, by directly knowing, by fully understanding form, by becoming dispassionate towards it, and by abandoning it, one is capable of achieving the complete end of suffering;

by directly knowing, by fully understanding felt experience, by becoming dispassionate towards it, and by abandoning it, one is capable of achieving the complete end of suffering;

by directly knowing, by fully understanding perception, by becoming dispassionate towards it, and by abandoning it, one is capable of achieving the complete end of suffering;
