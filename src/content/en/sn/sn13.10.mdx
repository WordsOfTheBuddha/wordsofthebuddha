At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, suppose the great Himalayan mountains were to be exhausted and depleted, leaving only seven pebbles the size of mustard seeds.

What do you think, bhikkhus, which is greater: the Himalayan mountains that have been exhausted and depleted, or the seven mustard-seed-sized pebbles that remain?"

"Venerable sir, the mass of the great Himalayan mountains that has been exhausted and depleted is indeed far greater. The seven small pebbles the size of mustard seeds are very little. Compared to what has been exhausted and depleted, these pebbles do not amount to a hundredth part, nor a thousandth part, nor even a hundred-thousandth part."

"Just so, bhikkhus, for the disciple of the noble ones who has attained |right view::view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]|, who has completely penetrated [the four noble truths], this much greater is the |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| that is exhausted and overcome; only a |small::tiny, minute, insignificant [appamattaka]| amount remains. It does not come to a hundredth part, nor to a thousandth part, nor to a hundred-thousandth part of the former mass of suffering that is exhausted and overcome compared to this final state of having at most seven more existences. Thus great, bhikkhus, is the realization of the Dhamma; thus great is the |attainment of the vision of the Dhamma::acquiring insight into the nature of reality [dhammacakkhupaṭilābha]|."
