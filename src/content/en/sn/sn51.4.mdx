"Bhikkhus, when the four |bases of psychic abilities::bases for spiritual power [iddhipādā]| are developed and frequently practiced, they lead to complete |disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]|, to |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|, to |gradual ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]|, to |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|, to |direct knowing::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, to |full awakening::perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]|, and to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from ||[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort.

These, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic abilities, which, when developed and frequently practiced, lead to complete disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to direct knowing, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna."
