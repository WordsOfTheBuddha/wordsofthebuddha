“Bhikkhus, when the four |bases of psychic power::bases for spiritual power, paths to supernormal abilities [iddhipādā]| are |cultivated::developed [bhāvita]| and frequently practiced, they lead to complete |disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]|, to |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|, to |ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]|, to |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|, to |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]|, to |full awakening::perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]|, and to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort.

These, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic powers, which, when developed and frequently practiced, lead to complete disenchantment, to the fading of desire, to gradual ending, to tranquility, to directly knowing, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna.”
