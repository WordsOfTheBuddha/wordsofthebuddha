“Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? Passion for form, passion for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance — these, bhikkhus, are the five higher fetters.

For the directly knowing, full understanding, complete exhaustion, and abandonment of these five higher fetters, the four bases of psychic powers should be developed.

And what are the four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation [chanda]| and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |determination::will power, energy [vīriya]| and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |[purification of] mind::purification of heart [citta]| and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic power that is endowed with collectedness arising from |investigation::consideration, reflection, and examination [vīmaṃsā]| and accompanied by intentional effort.

For the directly knowing, full understanding, complete exhaustion, and abandonment of these five higher fetters, these four bases of psychic powers should be developed.”

Floods, bonds, and clinging,
Knots, and underlying tendencies;
Sensual pleasure, hindrances,
Aggregates, fetters lower and higher.
