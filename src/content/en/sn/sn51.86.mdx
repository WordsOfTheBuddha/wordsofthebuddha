"Bhikkhus, there are these five higher fetters. What five? Passion for form, passion for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance â€” these, bhikkhus, are the five higher fetters.

For the direct knowing, full understanding, complete exhaustion, and abandonment of these five higher fetters, the four bases of psychic ability should be developed.

And what are the four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |aspiration::a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation| and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from |energy::persistence| and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort.

For the direct knowing, full understanding, complete exhaustion, and abandonment of these five higher fetters, these four bases of psychic ability should be developed."

Floods, bonds, and clinging,
Knots, and underlying tendencies;
Sensual pleasure, hindrances,
Aggregates, fetters lower and higher.
