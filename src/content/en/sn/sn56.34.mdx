“Bhikkhus, if one’s clothes or head were |burning::on fire, ablaze|, what should be done?

“Venerable sir, if one’s clothes or head were burning, then should arouse the utmost |intention::wish, desire, interest [chanda]|, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, enthusiasm, |tireless determination::indefatigably, with resolute intention [appaṭivānī]|, and apply |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]| and |full awareness::clear comprehension [sampajañña]| should be applied to extinguish the burning of one’s clothes or head.”

Bhikkhus, even though one’s clothes or head were burning, one might look on equanimously, |paying no attention to it::disregarding it [amanasikaritvā]|. But as long as one has not made the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths as they really are, then in order to make the breakthrough, one should arouse the utmost intention, make an extraordinary effort, stir up perseverance, enthusiasm, tireless determination, and apply mindfulness and full awareness.

And what are these four? The Noble Truth of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, the Noble Truth of the |arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|, the Noble Truth of the |ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|, the Noble Truth of the |way of practice leading to the ending of suffering::i.e. the Noble Eightfold Path consisting of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness [dukkhanirodhagāmī]|.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to |fully understand::understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate|: ‘This is suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the arising of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the ending of suffering’;
effort should be made to fully understand: ‘This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.’"
