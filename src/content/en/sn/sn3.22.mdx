At Sāvatthi.

When King Pasenadi of Kosala was seated to one side, the Blessed One said this to him: “Now where are you coming from, great king, in the middle of the day?”

“My grandmother, venerable sir, has passed away. She was old, aged, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, she was one hundred and twenty years old. Venerable sir, my grandmother was dear and beloved to me. If, venerable sir, by means of the |elephant treasure::one of the seven treasures of a universal ruler [hatthī + ratana]| I could have redeemed her from death, I would have given away even the elephant treasure so that she would not have passed away. If, venerable sir, by means of the |horse treasure::one of the seven treasures of a universal ruler [assa + ratana]| I could have redeemed her from death, I would have given away even the horse treasure so that she would not have passed away. If, venerable sir, by means of an excellent village I could have redeemed her from death, I would have given away even an excellent village so that she would not have passed away. If, venerable sir, by means of the country area I could have redeemed her from death, I would have given away even the country area so that she would not have passed away.”

“All beings, great king, are subject to death, have death as their end, and are not exempt from death.”

“It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvelous, venerable sir! How well this has been stated by the Blessed One: ‘All beings are subject to death, have death as their end, and are not exempt from death.’”

“So it is, great king. So it is, great king. All beings are subject to death, have death as their end, and are not exempt from death. Just as whatever pots made by a potter, whether unfired or fired, are subject to breaking, have breaking as their end, and are not exempt from breaking; so all beings are subject to death, have death as their end, and are not exempt from death.”

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Well-Gone One further said this:

“All beings will die,
for life has death as its end;
They will fare according to their deeds,
reaping the fruits of their merit and demerit;
The doer of |injurious actions::harmful, bad, potentially evil intention or action [pāpakamma]| goes to |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|,
The doer of merit goes to a |good destination::state of happiness [suggati]|.

Therefore, one should do |good::what is beneficial, wholesome, skillful, meritorious [kalyāṇa]|,
as a collection for the future life;
Merits are the support for living beings,
[when they arise] in the next world.”
