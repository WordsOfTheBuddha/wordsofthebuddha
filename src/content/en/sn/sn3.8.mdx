At Sāvatthi.

At one time, king Pasenadi of Kosala was staying in the upper chambers of his palace together with queen Mallikā.

Then king Pasenadi of Kosala said to queen Mallikā, “Mallikā, is there anyone |dearer::more beloved [piyatara]| to you than yourself?”

She replied, “No, great king, there is no one dearer to me than myself. But for you, great king, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?”

The king responded, “For me too, Mallikā, there is no one dearer to me than myself.”

Then king Pasenadi of Kosala descended from the palace and went to the Blessed One. Having approached him and paid his respects, he sat down to one side. Sitting there, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, I was staying in the upper chambers of my palace with queen Mallikā, and I said to her, ‘Mallikā, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?' When asked this, venerable sir, queen Mallikā replied to me, ‘No, great king, there is no one dearer to me than myself. But for you, great king, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?' When she said this, venerable sir, I replied to queen Mallikā, ‘For me too, Mallikā, there is no one dearer to me than myself.’”

Then the Blessed One, understanding the significance of this, recited this verse on that occasion:

“Having surveyed all directions with the mind,
one cannot find anything more dearer than oneself;
Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear,
Therefore, one desiring one’s own good should not |harm::hurt, injure, kill [hiṁsa]| others.”
