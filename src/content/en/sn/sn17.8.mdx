At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Bhikkhus, have you heard an old jackal howling during the early hours of the night, at the break of dawn?”

“Yes, venerable sir.”

“That old jackal, bhikkhus, afflicted by a disease called |mange::a type of skin disease caused by parasitic mites [ukkaṇḍaka]|, finds no delight whether he enters his den, rests at the foot of a tree, or lingers in the open air. Wherever he goes, wherever he stands, wherever he sits or lies down, there he meets with only misfortune and disaster.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a certain bhikkhu here who is overwhelmed by acquisitions, respect, and popularity, with his mind |consumed::obsessed, controlled [pariyādiṇṇa]| by them, finds no enjoyment whether he goes to an empty dwelling, to the foot of a tree, or in the open air. Wherever he goes, wherever he stands, wherever he sits or lies down, there he meets with only misfortune and disaster.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to |occupy::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
