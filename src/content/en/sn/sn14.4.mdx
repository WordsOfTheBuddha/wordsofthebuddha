At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), there arises a diversity of contacts, dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a \{diversity of sensations} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experiences, feelings, second of the five aggregates [vedanānānatta]).

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts, that dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a diversity of sensations?

Dependent on the objects of vision, there arises a \{contact with the eye} (visual impression, visual experience [cakkhusamphassa]), dependent on the contact with the eye, there arises a \{sensation connected with form} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with form [rūpavedanā]).
Dependent on sounds, there arises a \{contact with the ear} (auditory impression, sonic experience [sotasamphassa]), dependent on the contact with the ear, there arises a \{sensation connected with sound} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with sound [saddavedanā]).
Dependent on smells, there arises a \{contact with the nose} (olfactory impression, nasal experience [ghanasamphassa]), dependent on the contact with the nose, there arises a \{sensation connected with smell} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with smell [gandhavedanā]).
Dependent on tastes, there arises a \{contact with the tongue} (gustatory impression, taste experience [jivhāsamphassa]), dependent on the contact with the tongue, there arises a \{sensation connected with taste} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with taste [rasavedanā]).
Dependent on physical sensations, there arises a \{physical contact} (tactile impression, somatic experience [kāyasamphassa]), dependent on the physical contact, there arises a \{sensation connected with touch} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with touch [phoṭṭhabbavedanā]).
Dependent on mental objects, there arises a \{contact with the mind} (mental impression, cognitive experience [manasamphassa]), dependent on the contact with the mind, there arises a \{sensation connected with mental objects} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with mental objects [dhammavedanā]).

Thus, bhikkhus, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts, dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a diversity of sensations."
