At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, |dependent on::contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]| the |diversity of elements::varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]|, there arises a diversity of contacts, dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a |diversity of sensations::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experiences, feelings, second of the five aggregates [vedanānānatta]|.

And what is the diversity of elements? The |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpadhātu]|, |sounds::auditory objects such as various sounds, noises, melodic compositions, verbal expression, whether of praise, blame, honor, respect, disrespect [saddadhātu]|, |odors::smells, scents, fragrances, aromas, stench, perfumes, or natural fragrances such as of flowers, food, or earth [gandhadhātu]|, |tastes::flavors, tastes, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness, richness, or subtle tastes such as umami or astringency [rasadhātu]|, |touch::tangible objects such as physical surfaces, textures, fabrics, water, air, heat, cold, bodily pressure, or contact with living beings [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]|, and |mental objects::thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions, intentions, perceptions, concepts, beliefs, mental images, or fabrications arising from past experiences and future projections [dhammadhātu]|. This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts, that dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a diversity of sensations?

Dependent on the objects of vision, there arises a |contact with the eye::visual impression, visual experience [cakkhusamphassa]|, dependent on the contact with the eye, there arises a |sensation connected with form::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with form [rūpavedanā]|.
Dependent on sounds, there arises a |contact with the ear::auditory impression, sonic experience [sotasamphassa]|, dependent on the contact with the ear, there arises a |sensation connected with sound::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with sound [saddavedanā]|.
Dependent on smells, there arises a |contact with the nose::olfactory impression, nasal experience [ghanasamphassa]|, dependent on the contact with the nose, there arises a |sensation connected with smell::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with smell [gandhavedanā]|.
Dependent on tastes, there arises a |contact with the tongue::gustatory impression, taste experience [jivhāsamphassa]|, dependent on the contact with the tongue, there arises a |sensation connected with taste::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with taste [rasavedanā]|.
Dependent on physical sensations, there arises a |physical contact::tactile impression, somatic experience [kāyasamphassa]|, dependent on the physical contact, there arises a |sensation connected with touch::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with touch [phoṭṭhabbavedanā]|.
Dependent on mental objects, there arises a |contact with the mind::mental impression, cognitive experience [manasamphassa]|, dependent on the contact with the mind, there arises a |sensation connected with mental objects::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience connected with mental objects [dhammavedanā]|.

Thus, bhikkhus, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts, dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a diversity of sensations."
