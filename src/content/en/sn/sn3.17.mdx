At Sāvatthi.

Having sat down to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said this to the Blessed One: “Is there, venerable sir, one |Dhamma::principle, teaching, thing, quality [dhamma]|, which having accomplished, secures both kinds of |welfare::benefit, good [atthaṁ]| — welfare pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the next life?”

“There is, great king, one Dhamma which, having accomplished, secures both kinds of welfare — welfare pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the next life.”

“But, venerable sir, what is that one Dhamma which, having accomplished, secures both kinds of welfare — welfare pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the next life?”

“|Diligence::quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]|, great king, is that one Dhamma which, having accomplished, secures both kinds of welfare — welfare pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the next life. Just as, great king, all the footprints of living beings that walk fit into the footprint of the elephant, and the elephant's footprint is considered |ultimate::foremost, chief [agga]| by reason of its size — so too, great king, diligence is the one Dhamma which, having accomplished, secures both kinds of welfare — welfare pertaining to the present life and that pertaining to the next life.”

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Well-Gone One further said this:

### Verse

“Long life, health, beauty,
heaven and noble birth;
Aspiring for lofty delights,
one after the next.

The wise praise diligence
in the making of merit;
The diligent one, the wise person,
secures both kinds of welfare.

The welfare in this visible life,
and the welfare in the next life;
The stable one who realizes these goals,
is called wise.”
