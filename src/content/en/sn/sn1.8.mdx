At Sāvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"Those who are |totally confused::thoroughly muddled [susammuṭṭhā]| about the teachings,
are led by others' views;
They, being asleep, do not awaken,
though it is time for them to awaken."

[The Blessed One]: "Those who are |unconfused::unmuddled [asammuṭṭha]| about the teachings,
are not led by others' views;
They, awakened and |completely comprehending::fully understanding [sammadaññā]|,
fare |evenly::with balance, with peace, with tranquility [sama]| amidst the uneven."
