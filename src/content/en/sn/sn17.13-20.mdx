At Sāvatthi.

#### 17.13

"Here, bhikkhus, I know of a certain person by directly knowing their mind with my mind in this way: 'This venerable one would not, even for the sake of a gold coin, intentionally speak a deliberate lie.'

#### 17.14

'Nor would they speak a deliberate lie even for a hundred gold coins.'

#### 17.15

'Nor would they speak a deliberate lie even for the sake of an |ornamental gold coin::a gold coin of a higher quality or greater value than a regular gold coin [siṅgīnikkha]|.'

#### 17.16

'Nor would they speak a deliberate lie even for a hundred ornamental gold coins.'

#### 17.17

'Nor would they speak a deliberate lie even for the sake of the |whole earth filled with gold::world filled with gold [pathavī + jātarūpaparipūra]|.'

#### 17.18

'Nor would they speak a deliberate lie |for the sake of a small worldly benefit::for the purpose of a small worldly gain [āmisakiñcikkhahetu]|.'

#### 17.19

'Nor would they speak a deliberate lie even |for the sake of their own life::on account of one's life [jīvitahetu]|.'

#### 17.20

'Nor would they speak a deliberate lie even for the sake of a country's most beautiful woman.' I see that person at a later time, overwhelmed by acquisitions, respect, and popularity, with a mind consumed by them, speaking a deliberate lie."

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are vicious, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to |occupy::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
