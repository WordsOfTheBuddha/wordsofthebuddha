“From excessive sleep, |sluggishness::sloth, tiredness [tandī]|, |yawning::lazy stretching [vijambhitā]|,
|discontent::dislike, dissatisfaction, aversion, boredom [arati]|, and post-meal drowsiness;
Because of these, among beings,
the noble path does not appear.”

“Having dispelled excessive sleep, sluggishness, yawning,
discontent, and post-meal drowsiness;
with |energy::willpower, determination [vīriya]|,
the noble path is cleared.”
