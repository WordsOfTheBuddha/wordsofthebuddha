At Sāvatthi.

Standing to one side, the young deity Kassapa recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

“A bhikkhu should be a meditator, with a liberated mind,
Longing for the |attainment of one’s heart’s desire::awakened state [hadayassānupatti]|;
Having known the world’s |rise and fall::formation and dissolution, appearance and disappearance [udayabbaya]|,
Let him be lofty in mind and |disengaged::detached, independent [anissita]|.”
