Thus have I heard — At Sāvatthi.

There the Blessed One said this:

"|Form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one's body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]|, bhikkhus, is impermanent, |felt experience::pleasant, neutral or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]| is impermanent, |perception::interpretation and recognition of oneself, of things. It can involve concepts, labels, and judgments; third of the five aggregates [sañña]| is impermanent, |volitional formations::intentions, choices, decisions, karmic activity; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]| are impermanent, |consciousness::quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind]; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]| is impermanent.

Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the |learned::well-studied, instructed [sutavant]| disciple of the noble ones becomes |disenchanted with::disillusioned with [nibbindati]| form, becomes disenchanted with felt experience, becomes disenchanted with perception, becomes disenchanted with volitional formations, becomes disenchanted with consciousness. Experiencing disenchantment, they become |detached::dispassionate [virajjati]|; through detachment, there is release. When released, there arises the knowledge: 'Released.'

'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being,' one understands."
