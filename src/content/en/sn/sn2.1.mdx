Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

Then, when the night had advanced, the young deity Kassapa, with a radiant appearance, illuminating the entire Jeta’s grove, approached the Blessed One. Having drawn near, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said to the Blessed One: “The Blessed One has revealed the bhikkhu but not the instruction to the bhikkhu.”

[The Blessed One]: “Well then, Kassapa, clear up this point yourself.”

“He should train in |well-spoken::articulate, eloquent [subhāsita]| speech,
And in the contemplative practice,
Sitting alone, |in seclusion::privately [raho]|,
in |settling of::calming of, subsiding of, conciliation of, peace of [vūpasama]| the mind.”

This is what the young deity Kassapa said, the teacher approved. Then the young deity Kassapa, thinking, “The Teacher has approved of me,” paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, he disappeared right there.
