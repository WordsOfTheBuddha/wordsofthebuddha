title: Cakkhu sutta - Eye
description: The Buddha explains to the bhikkhus that the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are impermanent, changing, and becoming otherwise. One who has faith and conviction in these phenomena is called a faith-follower, one who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of awakened beings, and is incapable of performing an action that would lead to rebirth in lower realms.

At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the ear is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the nose is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the tongue is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the body is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the mind is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

Bhikkhus, one who has faith and conviction in these |phenomena::characteristics, thoughts, mental states, mental qualities [dhammā]| in this way is called a faith-follower, who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of awakened beings, has left behind the plane of ordinary individuals; such a one is incapable of performing an action that would lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts; and is incapable of dying without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.

Bhikkhus, one for whom these phenomena are accepted through wisdom after pondering over them to a sufficient degree is called a dhamma-follower, who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of awakened beings, has left behind the plane of ordinary individuals; such a one is incapable of performing an action that would lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts; and is incapable of dying without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.

Bhikkhus, one who knows and sees these phenomena in this way is called a stream-enterer, no longer subject to rebirth in lower realms, fixed in destiny, and bound for full awakening.”
