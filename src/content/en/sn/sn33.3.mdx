At Sāvatthi.

While seated to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta addressed the Blessed One:

“Venerable Gotama, what is the cause and condition for the various kinds of views that arise in the world, such as: ‘The world is eternal,’ or ‘The world is not eternal,’ ... or ‘After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’?”

[The Blessed One replied]: “Vaccha, it is from not knowing perception, not knowing the arising of perception, not knowing the cessation of perception, not knowing the practice leading to the cessation of perception that these various kinds of views arise in the world, such as: ‘The world is eternal,’ ... or ‘After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’ This, Vaccha, is the cause and condition for the various kinds of views that arise in the world: ‘The world is eternal,’ or ‘The world is not eternal,’ ... or ‘After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’"
