At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, if someone were |to give a donation::the act of giving or donating, with an intention to give [dāna]| of a hundred pots [of food] in the morning, a hundred pots of food at noon, and a hundred pots of food in the evening, and if someone else were to cultivate a |mind of loving-kindness::friendly heart, kind mind, benevolent mind [mettācitta]| even for the brief moment it takes to milk a cow, whether in the morning, at noon, or in the evening — this [cultivation of loving-kindness] would yield far greater fruit than those givings.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'Our |release of mind::mental liberation, emancipation of heart, a meditation attainment [cetovimutti]| through loving-kindness will be developed, practiced often, made a vehicle, made a basis, firmly established, nurtured, and |resolutely undertaken::fully engaged with, energetically taken up [susamāraddha]|.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
