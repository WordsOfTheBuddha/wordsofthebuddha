At Sāvatthi.

“Bhikkhus, |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]| are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Bhikkhus, even though a beauty queen, when one is alone with her, may not remain |occupying::obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]| one’s mind, still, acquisitions, respect, and popularity might remain occupying one’s mind.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to occupy our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.”
