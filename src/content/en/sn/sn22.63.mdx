Thus have I heard—At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park.

Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “It would be good if the Blessed One were to teach the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, secluded [from sensual pleasures], |with diligence::quality of doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]|, |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, and |determined::resolute, applying oneself [pahitatta]|.”

“|In clinging::in grasping, in being attached, in holding onto [upādiyamāna]|, bhikkhu, one is bound by |Māra::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]|; |by not clinging::by not attaching to, by not taking as mine, by not grasping [anupādiyamāna]|, one is freed from the |Evil One::profoundly immoral and wicked, having evil quality, epithet of Māra [pāpimant]|.”

"Understood, Blessed One! Understood, |Fortunate One::well gone, Accomplished One, epithet of the Buddha [sugata]|!"

"In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?"

"In clinging to |form::materiality, material existence, experience of the material world, i.e. encompassing both one's body and external objects, whether near or far, gross or subtle, deficient or refined; first of the five aggregates [rūpa]|, venerable sir, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to form, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to |felt experience::pleasant, neutral or painful sensation, feeling felt on contact through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]|, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to felt experience, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to |perception::interpretation and recognition of oneself, of things. It can involve concepts, labels, and judgments; third of the five aggregates [sañña]|, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to perception, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to |volitional formations::intentions, choices, decisions, karmic activity; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]|, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to volitional formations, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to |consciousness::quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind]; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]|, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to consciousness, one is freed from the Evil One.

It is in this way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief.”

“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief.

In clinging to form, bhikkhu, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to form, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to felt experience, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to felt experience, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to perception, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to perception, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to volitional formations, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to volitional formations, one is freed from the Evil One. In clinging to consciousness, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to consciousness, one is freed from the Evil One.

It is in this way, bhikkhu, that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood.”

Then that bhikkhu, having delighted and approved of what the Blessed One had said, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.

Then that bhikkhu, dwelling alone, secluded, with diligence, with continuous effort, and determined, before long, realized for himself with |direct knowing::experiential realization [abhiññā]|, in this very life, the |perfection of the spiritual life::ideal of the spiritual path, culmination of the spiritual life [brahmacariyapariyosāna]|, for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it, he |abided::lived, dwelled, stayed, remained, continued [viharati]| in it.

He understood: "Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being." And that bhikkhu became one among the |arahants::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|.
