While standing to one side, the young deity Anāthapiṇḍika recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:

“This indeed is that Jeta’s Grove,
inhabited by the assembly of sages;
Dwelt in by the |king of the Dhamma::epithet of the Buddha [dhammarāja]|,
a place that gives me |joy::heartfelt or intense joy, feeling of love, rapture lit. lovely feeling [pīti]|.

|Action::deed, volitional act [kamma]|, |wisdom::clear apprehension of how things have come to be, directly knowing [vijja]|, and |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
|virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]| and an excellent way of life;
By these, the mortals are purified,
not by lineage or by wealth.

Therefore, a person who is |wise::astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]|,
out of regard for his own good;
should thoroughly examine the Dhamma,
thus he is purified by it.

|Sāriputta::foremost disciple of the Buddha in great wisdom [sāriputta]| truly is endowed with wisdom,
with virtue and |tranquility::calmness, serenity, stillness, peace [upasama]|;
Even a bhikkhu who has gone beyond,
at best can only equal him.”

This is what the young deity Anāthapiṇḍika said. Having said this, he paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, he disappeared right there.

Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, a certain young deity, with a radiant appearance, having illuminated the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached me. Having approached, he paid homage to me and stood to one side. While standing to one side, bhikkhus, that deity recited these verses in my presence:

‘This indeed is that Jeta’s Grove,
inhabited by the assembly of sages;
Dwelt in by the king of the Dhamma,
a place that gives me joy.

Action, wisdom, and Dhamma,
virtue and an excellent way of life;
By these, the mortals are purified,
not by lineage or by wealth.

Therefore, a person who is wise,
out of regard for his own good;
should thoroughly examine the Dhamma,
thus he is purified by it.

Sāriputta truly is endowed with wisdom,
with virtue and tranquility;
Even a bhikkhu who has gone beyond,
at best can only equal him.’

This is what that young deity said, bhikkhus. Having said this, he paid homage to me and, keeping me on the right, he disappeared right there.”

When this was said, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, that young deva must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika. For Anāthapiṇḍika the householder had full confidence in the venerable Sāriputta.”

“Good, good, Ānanda! You have drawn the right inference by reasoning. For that young deity, Ānanda, was Anāthapiṇḍika.”
