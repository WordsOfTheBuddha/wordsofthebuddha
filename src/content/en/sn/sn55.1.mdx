At Sāvatthi.

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, “Bhikkhus.”

“Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

“Bhikkhus, even if a Wheel-Turning Monarch, having ruled the four continents, after the break-up of the body, upon death, is reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world, in companionship with the gods of the Thirty-three, where he enjoys himself in the Nandana grove surrounded by a group of celestial nymphs, delighting in the five kinds of heavenly sensual pleasures, yet, if he is not endowed with four qualities, he is still not freed from hell, not freed from the animal realm, not freed from the ghost realm, and not freed from the states of misery, bad destinations, and the lower realms.

On the other hand, bhikkhus, even if a disciple of the Noble Ones lives off alms food, wears ragged robes, and is endowed with four qualities, he is freed from hell, freed from the animal realm, freed from the domain of ghosts, and freed from the states of misery, bad destinations, and the lower realms.

What four? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones is endowed with |perfect clarity::unshakable confidence that arises through direct experience, by personally seeing the benefits in one’s own practice [aveccappasāda]| in the Buddha: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an |Arahant::a worthy one, a fully awakened being, epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|, a perfectly Awakened One, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, a teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One.’

He is endowed with perfect clarity in the teachings of the Buddha: ‘Indeed, the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, |onward leading::applicable, relevant, practical [opaneyyika]|, to be personally experienced by the wise.’

He is endowed with perfect clarity in the |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]|: ‘Indeed, the community of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this community of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’

He is endowed with virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones—unbroken, untorn, not spotty, unblemished, freeing, praised by the wise, irreproachable, |leading to collectedness::leading to samadhi, conducive to mental composure [samādhisaṃvattanika]|.

Thus, he is endowed with these four qualities.

And, bhikkhus, between |acquiring of::gaining of, obtaining of [paṭilābha]| the four continents and acquiring of these four qualities, the acquiring of the four continents is not worth even a sixteenth part of the acquiring of these four qualities.
