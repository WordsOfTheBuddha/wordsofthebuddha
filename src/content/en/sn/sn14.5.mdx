At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, |dependent on::contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]| the |diversity of elements::varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]|, there arises a diversity of contacts,
dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a |diversity of sensations::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experiences, feelings, second of the five aggregates [vedanānānatta]|.
Diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on the diversity of sensations,
and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts.

And what is the diversity of elements? The |objects of vision::form element [rūpadhātu]|, |sounds::voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]|, |smells::odors [gandhadhātu]|, |tastes::flavors [rasadhātu]|, |physical sensations::touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]|, and |mental objects::mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]|. This is called the diversity of elements.

How is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts,
that dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a diversity of sensations,
that diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on the diversity of sensations,
that diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts?

### 1. Objects of vision

Dependent on the objects of vision, there arises a |contact with the eye::visual impression, visual experience [cakkhusamphassa]|,
dependent on the contact with the eye, there arises a |sensation connected with form::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience produced by a visual impression [rūpavedanā]|.
Contact with the eye does not arise dependent on a sensation connected with form,
and objects of vision do not arise dependent on a contact with the eye.

### 2. Sounds

Dependent on sounds, there arises a |contact with the ear::auditory impression, sonic experience [sotasamphassa]|,
dependent on the contact with the ear, there arises a |sensation connected with sound::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience produced by an auditory impression [saddavedanā]|.
Contact with the ear does not arise dependent on a sensation connected with sound,
and sounds do not arise dependent on a contact with the ear.

### 3. Smells

Dependent on smells, there arises a |contact with the nose::olfactory impression, nasal experience [ghanasamphassa]|,
dependent on the contact with the nose, there arises a |sensation connected with smell::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience produced by an olfactory impression [gandhavedanā]|.
Contact with the nose does not arise dependent on a sensation connected with smell,
and smells do not arise dependent on a contact with the nose.

### 4. Tastes

Dependent on tastes, there arises a |contact with the tongue::gustatory impression, taste experience [jivhāsamphassa]|,
dependent on the contact with the tongue, there arises a |sensation connected with taste::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience produced by a gustatory impression [rasavedanā]|.
Contact with the tongue does not arise dependent on a sensation connected with taste,
and tastes do not arise dependent on a contact with the tongue.

### 5. Physical sensations

Dependent on physical sensations, there arises a |physical contact::tactile impression, somatic experience [kāyasamphassa]|,
dependent on the physical contact, there arises a |sensation connected with touch::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience produced by a tactile impression [phoṭṭhabbavedanā]|.
Physical contact does not arise dependent on a sensation connected with touch,
and physical sensations do not arise dependent on a physical contact.

### 6. Mental objects

Dependent on mental objects, there arises a |contact with the mind::mental impression, cognitive experience [manasamphassa]|,
dependent on the contact with the mind, there arises a |sensation connected with mental objects::pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience produced by a mental impression [dhammavedanā]|.
Contact with the mind does not arise dependent on a sensation connected with mental objects,
and mental objects do not arise dependent on a contact with the mind.

Thus, bhikkhus, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of contacts, dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises a diversity of sensations. Diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on the diversity of sensations, and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of contacts."
