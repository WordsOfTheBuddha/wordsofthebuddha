This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, for a person who has transgressed one principle, I say there is no evil deed that they would not commit. And what is that one principle? It is |intentional lying::purposeful use of false speech [sampajānamusāvāda]|, bhikkhus."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"For one who has transgressed one principle,
for the person who purposefully lies;
Who disregards the next world,
there is no evil that they would not commit."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
