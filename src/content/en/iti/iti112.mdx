This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, the world has been perfectly understood by the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|, the Tathāgata is |disentangled from::disengaged from, detached from, unfettered from [visaṃyutta]| the world. Bhikkhus, the arising of the world has been perfectly understood by the Tathāgata, the arising of the world has been abandoned by the Tathāgata. Bhikkhus, the |cessation of the world::truth of cessation [lokanirodha]| has been perfectly understood by the Tathāgata, the cessation of the world has been |personally realized::experientially understood [sacchikata]| by the Tathāgata. Bhikkhus, the way of practice leading to the cessation of the world has been perfectly understood by the Tathāgata, the way of practice leading to the cessation of the world has been |cultivated::developed [bhāvita]| by the Tathāgata.

Bhikkhus, whatever is seen, heard, |sensed::smelled, tasted, felt, or thought [muta]|, |cognized::known, understood [viññāta]|, |accomplished::attained, found [patta]|, |sought out::searched for [pariyesita]|, or |reflected on::pondered over [anuvicarita]| the mind in this world with its |deities::gods [devas]|, |Māras::demons, tempters, beings of delusion; lit. causing death [mārake]|, |Brahmas::Gods; celestial beings residing in the Brahmā realms, often considered to be highly refined and long-lived deities. [brahmā]|, its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, all that has been perfectly understood by the Tathāgata. Therefore, he is called the Tathāgata.

And bhikkhus, whatever the Tathāgata speaks, talks, or declares during the interval between the night he awakens to unsurpassed perfect awakening and the night he attains |final Nibbāna::complete cooling, full quenching, total emancipation, dying one’s final death [parinibbuta]| in the element of Nibbāna without a remainder of clinging, all that is just so and not otherwise. Therefore, he is called the Tathāgata.

Bhikkhus, as he speaks, so he acts; as he acts, so he speaks. Therefore, one whose words match his actions and whose actions match his words is called the Tathāgata.

Bhikkhus, in the world with its deities, Māras, Brahmas, its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, the Tathāgata is unsurpassed, unconquered, one who sees things as they are, and wielding power. Therefore, he is called the Tathāgata.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having directly known the whole world,
|as it is in actuality::as it has come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]|;
Disentangled from the whole world,
|disinterested in::unattracted to, unattached to [anūpaya]| the whole world—

He is the unsurpassed of all, the wise one,
liberated from all ties;
Having reached the supreme peace:
|Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|, without fear from any quarter.

He is the Awakened One, |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|,
|untroubled::undisturbed, calm, free from affliction [anīgha]|, with doubts cut off;
Having reached the end of all actions,
he is freed with the |ending of identification::eradication of attachment, end of acquisitions [upadhisaṅkhaya]|.

This one, the Blessed One, the Awakened One,
the unsurpassed lion;
In the world with its deities,
sets in motion the wheel of |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|.

Thus, gods and humans,
who have gone to the Buddha for refuge;
Having come together,
honor that great, |self-assured::confident; lit. without inexperience [vītasārada]| one.

|Tamed::trained, mastered [danta]|, the best of those to be tamed;
|tranquil::peaceful, calm [santa]|, the sage among the tranquil;
Liberated, the foremost among the free;
crossed over, the chief of those who cross over.

Thus they honor this great one
the great, self-assured one;
In the world with its deities,
there is no one who equals you.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
