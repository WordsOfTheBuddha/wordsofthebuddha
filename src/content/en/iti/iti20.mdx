This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Here, bhikkhus, I discern with the mind, after having examined a certain person with an |upset::angry, irritable or offended [paduṭṭha]| mind as follows: ‘If this person were to die at this very moment, they would be reborn in |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|, just as if they were carried and |placed::dropped, set aside [nikkhitta]| there.’ What is the reason for this? Because their mind is upset. Due to mental corruption, bhikkhus, some beings, with the breaking up of the body, after death, are reborn |in a state of loss::in a state of misery [apāya]|, in a bad destination, in a |realm of downfall::realm of misery [vinipāta]|, in hell.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having known a certain person here,
to have an upset mind;
The Buddha explained this matter,
in the presence of the bhikkhus —

If this person were to die,
at this very moment;
They would be reborn in hell,
for their mind is upset.

Just as one might carry something and |set it down::puts down, places it down [nikkhipati]|,
so too is such a person [placed in hell];
Indeed, due to mental corruption,
beings go to a bad destination.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
