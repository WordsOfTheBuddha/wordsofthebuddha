This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Here, bhikkhus, I discern with the mind, after having examined a certain person with a |corrupted::corrupted, such as often angry, upset, or resentful [paduṭṭha]| mind as follows: 'If this person were to die at this very moment, they would be reborn in |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|, just as if they were carried and |placed::dropped, set aside [nikkhitta]| there.' What is the reason for this? Because their mind is corrupted. Due to the corruption of the mind, bhikkhus, some beings, after the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn |in a state of loss::in a state of misery [apāya]|, in a bad destination, in the |realms of downfall::in realms of misery [vinipāta]|, in hell.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having known a certain person here,
to have a corrupted mind;
The Buddha explained this matter,
in the presence of the bhikkhus —

If this person were to die,
at this very moment;
They would be reborn in hell,
for their mind is corrupted.

Just as one might carry something and |set it down::puts down, places it down [nikkhipati]|,
so too is such a person [placed in hell];
Indeed, due to the corruption of mind,
beings go to a bad destination.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
