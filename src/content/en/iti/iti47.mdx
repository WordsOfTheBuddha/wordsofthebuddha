This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell wakeful (alert, lucid [jāgara]), mindful (mindfulness of body in and of itself, of felt experience in and of itself, of mind in and of itself, of mental qualities in and of itself [sati]), \{fully aware} (with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension [sampajañña]), collected (composed, settled [samāhita]), joyful, tranquil (serene, calm [vippasanna]), and there, he should discern (see distinctly, observe [vipassi]) with clarity at a suitable occasion in regard to the wholesome (healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]) \{mental qualities} (inherent qualities, reality [dhamma]). Bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu who dwells wakeful, mindful, fully aware, collected, joyful, tranquil, and there, discerning with clarity at a suitable occasion in regard to the wholesome mental qualities, one of two results is to be expected: either \{final knowledge} (spiritual insight [aññā]) [of full awakening] here and now, or, if there is any \{residual clinging for existence} (remnant of grasping for renewed becoming [upādisesa]), the state of non-returning (third stage of awakening where the five lower fetters are permanently dropped [anāgāmitā])."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Those who are wakeful, listen to this,
You who are asleep, wake up;
Being awake is better than being asleep,
For the wakeful, there is no fear.

One who is wakeful, mindful, and fully aware,
collected, joyful, and tranquil;
By thoroughly examining the mental qualities at the proper time,
unified (becoming whole, becoming integrated [ekodibhūta]), they dispel the darkness (ignorance, gloom, murkiness [tamas]).

Therefore, cultivate wakefulness,
The bhikkhu who is \{with continuous effort} (ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]), discerning (astute, wise [nipaka]), and \{who gains jhānas at will} (accomplished in meditation, who has deep states of meditation [jhānalābhī]);
Having cut off the fetter of \{being born and ageing} (birth and old age [jātijarā]),
will realize the highest awakening right here."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
