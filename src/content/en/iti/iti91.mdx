This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, this is the extreme of livelihoods, namely, subsisting on alms. In this world, it is considered a curse: 'You wander about with bowl in hand!' Yet, grounded on good purpose, this is what sensible sons of good family engage in — not |because authorities force them::because of the king [rājābhinīta]|, nor because thieves drive them out, nor because they are |debt-ridden::fallen into debt [iṇaṭṭa]|, afflicted with fear, or have |difficulty earning a living::problems with livelihood [ājīvikāpakata]|. Rather, they do so because they are afflicted by birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair — overwhelmed by suffering, consumed by suffering. They hope that, perhaps the |complete ending of::relief from [antakiriyā]| this entire |mass of suffering::heap of difficulties [dukkhakkhandha]| |could be discerned::can become evident [paññāyetha]|. In this way, the son of a good family |renounces::ordains, goes forth [pabbajita]|.

But even so, such a bhikkhu may still |have intense craving::be greedy, covetous, with yearning, desiring, mentally obsessed [abhijjhālu]|, filled |with intense lust::with strong desire [tibbasārāga]| for sensual pleasures, and |harboring ill will::having harmful intentions [paduṭṭhamanasaṅkappa]| |with a malicious mind::evil-minded, hateful [byāpannacitta]|. He may be |muddle-minded::forgetful, not mindful [muṭṭhassatī]|, |lacking clear awareness::inattentive [asampajāna]|, |distracted::with scattered attention, not collected, not well-composed [asamāhita]|, |with a wandering mind::with runaway thoughts, mentally out of control [vibbhantacitta]| and |with unrestrained faculties::with uncontrolled senses bases, having a vulgar mind [pākatindriya]|. Just as a |charred log::firewood log used for burning a funeral pyre [chavālāta]|, burnt at both ends and smeared with filth in the middle, is of no use either in the village or the forest; so too, bhikkhus, I say, is such a person: deprived of the |enjoyment of a lay person::household wealth and pleasures [gihibhoga]|, yet unable to fulfill the |goal of renunciation::goal of the ascetic life, epithet of Nibbāna [sāmaññattha]|."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Deprived of the enjoyment of a lay person,
and |failing to::without luck in [dubbhaga]| fulfill the goal of renunciation;
|Falling apart::coming to ruin [paridhaṃsamāna]|, he scatters around,
like a charred log, he |comes to naught::is wasted, is lost [nassati]|.

Many who wear the |ochre::organic brown, color of Buddhist monk's robes [kāsāva]| robe,
are unrestrained and |evil-natured::one who has had a long association of harmful mental qualities - of negligence, laziness, having many wishes, irrational application of mind, lack of situational awareness, having bad friends, pursuing bad habits [pāpadhamma]|;
By performing |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| actions,
the evil-doer |re-arises::is reborn [upapajjati]| in hell.

Better to swallow a red-hot iron ball,
burning like a blazing flame;
Than for an |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]| and |unrestrained::uncontrolled [asaññata]| person,
to consume the |community's alms food::food offered by the people [raṭṭhapiṇḍa]|."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
