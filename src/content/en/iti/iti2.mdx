This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, abandon one thing; I am your guarantor for non-returning. What one thing? Bhikkhus, abandon |aversion::A reactive mental quality of rejection rooted in ill will, irritation, or hostility that pushes away unpleasant objects or experiences; it fuels conflict and resists acceptance, obstructing patience and kindness [dosa]|; I am your guarantor for non-returning."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Overcome by aversion, through which,
beings go to an unfortunate destination;
|Fully understanding::completely comprehending [sammadaññā]| that aversion,
those seeing clearly abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not come again,
to this world at any time."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
