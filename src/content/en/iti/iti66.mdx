This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“There are three kinds of purity, bhikkhus. What three? |Bodily purity::purity of bodily conduct [kāyasoceyya]|, |verbal purity::purity of verbal conduct [vacīsoceyya]|, and |mental purity::purity of mental conduct [manosoceyya]|—these, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of purity.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Bodily purity, verbal purity,
and the taint-less purity of mind;
A moral person |accomplished in::fulfilled regarding, consummate in, endowed with [sampanna]| purity,
is said to have abandoned all [evil].”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
