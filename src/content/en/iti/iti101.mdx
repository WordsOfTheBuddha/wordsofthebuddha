This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, these four things are trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. What four? 1) Robes made from discarded rags, bhikkhus, are trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. 2) Lumps of alms food, bhikkhus, are trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. 3) Lodging at the foot of a tree, bhikkhus, is trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. 4) Fermented urine as medicine, bhikkhus, is trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. Bhikkhus, these four things are trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. When a bhikkhu is |content with::pleased with, satisfied with [tuṭṭha]| what is trifling, easily obtained, and blameless, I say that this is one of the factors of the |spiritual life::ascetic life, monkhood [sāmañña]|.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“For one who is content with the blameless,
with what is trifling and easily obtained;
Regarding lodging,
robes, drink, and food;
There is no |vexation::affliction, irritation [vighāta]| of mind,
and no direction is obstructed to him.

And these principles which have been declared,
are conducive to the spiritual life;
And are acquired by the content,
and |diligent::doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]| bhikkhu.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
