This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, these four things are trifling, easily obtained, and |blameless::irreproachable, faultless [anavajja]|. What four? 1) A robe made from discarded rags, bhikkhus, is trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. 2) Lumps of alms food, bhikkhus, are trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. 3) Lodging at the foot of a tree, bhikkhus, is trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. 4) Fermented urine as medicine, bhikkhus, is trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. Bhikkhus, these four things are trifling, easily obtained, and blameless. When a bhikkhu is |content with::pleased with, satisfied with [tuṭṭha]| what is trifling, easily obtained, and blameless, I say that he has a key factor of the |spiritual life::ascetic life, monkhood [sāmañña]|.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“For one content with what is blameless,
with little that is easily obtained;
With regard to lodging,
robes, drink, and food —
there is no |vexation::affliction, irritation [vighāta]| for the mind,
[they are] not obstructed anywhere.

These qualities are said to be,
suitable for the spiritual life;
They are excelled in by a contented,
and |diligent::doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]| bhikkhu.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
