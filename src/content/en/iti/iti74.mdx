This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of children found in the world. What three? The one who surpasses [their parents], the one who follows in their footsteps, and the one who falls below [them].

And how, bhikkhus, does a child become one who surpasses their parents? Here, bhikkhus, a child’s parents are ones who have not gone to the Buddha, |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, or |Saṅgha::The community of monks and nuns practicing in line with the Buddha’s teachings. In the broader sense, this is the community of disciples who have realized the noble path and fruition through the Buddha’s teachings [saṅgha]| for refuge. They do not abstain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from |consuming intoxicants::consuming wine, spirits, or drugs and getting intoxicated [surāmerayamajjappamādaṭṭhāyī]| causing carelessness; they are |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]| and |endowed with harmful qualities::one who has had a long association of harmful mental qualities - of negligence, laziness, having many wishes, irrational application of mind, lack of situational awareness, having bad friends, pursuing bad habits [pāpadhamma]|. But their child has gone to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha for refuge. They refrain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from consuming intoxicants causing carelessness. They are |virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]| and |endowed with wholesome qualities::one who has had a long association of wholesome mental qualities - of diligence, aroused energy, having few wishes, rational application of mind, having situational awareness, having good friends, pursuing good habits [kalyāṇadhamma]|. In this way, bhikkhus, a child becomes one who surpasses their parents.

And how does a child become one who follows in their parents’ footsteps? Here, bhikkhus, a child’s parents are ones who have gone to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha for refuge. They refrain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from consuming intoxicants causing carelessness. They are virtuous and endowed with wholesome qualities. And their child likewise has gone to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha for refuge. They refrain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from consuming intoxicants causing carelessness. They are virtuous and endowed with wholesome qualities. In this way, bhikkhus, a child becomes one who follows in their parents’ footsteps.

And how, bhikkhus, does a child become one who falls below their parents? Here, bhikkhus, a child’s parents are ones who have gone to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha for refuge. They refrain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from consuming intoxicants causing carelessness. They are virtuous and endowed with wholesome qualities. But their child has not gone to the Buddha, Dhamma, or Saṅgha for refuge. They do not abstain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from consuming intoxicants causing carelessness; they are unprincipled and endowed with harmful qualities. In this way, bhikkhus, a child becomes one who falls below [their parents]. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of children found in the world.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“The wise desire a child,
who surpasses or one who follows after them;
They do not wish for one who falls below,
who brings dishonor to the family.

These are the children found in the world—
Those who are lay followers,
endowed with faith and virtue,
generous, and |free from stinginess::selfless, without envy, jealousy, or hostility [vītamacchara]|;
Like the moon freed from clouds,
they shine brightly among |assemblies::communities [parisā]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
