This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, beings come together and associate with other beings |according to disposition::in line with their mental qualities or inclinations [dhātuso]|. Those with an |inferior disposition::with bad inclination, with low tendencies [hīnādhimuttika]| come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a |good disposition::whose inclinations are good, intent on good [kalyāṇādhimuttika]| come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition.

In the past, too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated with other beings according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition came together and associated with those of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a good disposition came together and associated with those of a similar good disposition.

In the future, too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate with other beings according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a good disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition.

Even now, bhikkhus, in the present time, beings come together and associate with other beings according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition. Those with a good disposition come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“From |association::mingling, mixing, contact, intimacy, touch, entanglement [saṃsagga]|, |craving::entanglements, subtle attachments, desire [vanatha]| arises,
through non-association, it |is cut-off::is severed, ceases to exist, is broken [chijjati]|;
Like one who boards a fragile raft,
and sinks in the mighty ocean.

So by consorting with a |lazy person::a procrastinating, inactive person, indolent [kusīta]|,
even a virtuous person sinks;
Therefore, one should |steer clear of::avoid, shun [parivajjati]| a lazy person,
who is |weak in effort::low in energy, lacking in endurance [hīnavīriya]|.

|Dwell together::keep company [sahāvasa]| with the wise,
with the |Noble Ones::distinguished, an ethically noble person, an awakened being [ariya]| who dwell |in seclusion::separated, withdrawn, detached [pavivitta]|;
With |meditators::yogis [jhāyi]| who are |resolute::determined, intent [pahitatta]| on their goal,
who are |continuously::regularly, reliably [nicca]| |with energy aroused::with initiative [āraddhavīriya]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
