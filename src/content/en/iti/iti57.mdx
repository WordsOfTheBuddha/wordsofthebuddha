This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three |defilements::outflows, discharges, taints [āsavā]|. What three? The |taint of sensual desire::oozing sensual desire [kāmāsava]|, the |taint of becoming::effluent of being, taint of existence [bhavāsava]|, and the |taint of ignorance::taint of not knowing how things have come to be, illusion of knowing, distorted perception [avijjāsava]|. These are the three defilements.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“One whose taint of sensual desire is |exhausted::depleted, finished [khīṇa]|,
and ignorance has faded away;
One whose taint of existence is fully exhausted,
is completely released, and |free from attachment::free from grasping, not taking as mine, not appropriating [nirūpadhi]|;
He carries his final body,
having defeated |Māra::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]| and his army.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
