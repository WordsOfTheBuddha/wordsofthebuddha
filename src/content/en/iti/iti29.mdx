This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with two qualities lives |contented::easily, comfortably, pleasantly [sukhaṃ]| in this very life, without distress, without trouble, without burning [passion]; and upon the breaking up of the body, after death, a good destination is expected. What two? |Guarding of the sense doors::controlled in senses, having self-restraint [guttadvāratā]| and |moderation::knowing the limit [mattaññū]| in eating. Endowed with these two qualities, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives contented in this very life, without distress, without trouble, without burning [passion]; and upon the breaking up of the body, after death, a good destination is expected.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“The eye and the ear, and the nose,
the tongue, the body, and likewise the mind;
For a bhikkhu who has these doors,
well-guarded here —

Moderate in eating,
restrained in the senses;
He attains bodily and mental ease,
and experiences contentment.

With a body |not burning::not tormented, not aflame, not suffering [aḍayhamānena]|,
with a mind not burning;
Whether by day or by night,
such a one dwells in contentment.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
