This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, whoever has not let go of |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|, has not let go of |aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, and has not let go of |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misapprehension, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|—such a person, bhikkhus, is said to be bound by |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]|, ensnared by Māra's trap, at the mercy of the |Evil One::profoundly immoral and wicked, having evil quality, epithet of Māra [pāpimant]|, subject to his will. On the other hand, bhikkhus, whoever has let go of passion, has let go of aversion, and has let go of illusion—such a person, bhikkhus, is said to be not bound by Māra, released from Māra's trap, and not at the mercy of the Evil One, and not subject to his will."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"For one in whom passion, aversion,
and |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]| have faded away;
The one, |who is awakened::who is self-developed, who has a developed mind [bhāvitatta]|,
noble, arrived at the truth;
The Awakened One, who has gone beyond hostility and fear,
they call him one who has given up everything."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
