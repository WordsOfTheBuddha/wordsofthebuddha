This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, whoever, whether a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī, has not let go of |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|, has not let go of |aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, and has not let go of |illusion::delusion, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; it fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|—such a person, bhikkhus, is called one who is still caught in the ocean—with its waves, currents, whirlpools, and lurking with fierce beasts and monsters. On the other hand, bhikkhus, whoever, whether a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī, has let go of passion, has let go of aversion, and has let go of illusion—such a person, bhikkhus, is called one who has crossed beyond the ocean—with its waves, currents, whirlpools, and lurking with fierce animals and monsters. Having reached the far shore, they stand on firm ground as a |sage::Brāhmaṇa, a title used by the Buddha for an Arahant, an awakened being [brāhmaṇa]|.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“For one in whom passion, aversion,
and |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]| have faded away;
[That one] has crossed beyond the ocean—hard to cross,
with the peril of waves, fierce beasts and monsters.

One who has gone beyond attachment, abandoned death, being |free from attachment::free from grasping, not taking as mine, not appropriating [nirūpadhi]|,
has left behind |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, and will not return to |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|;
Having vanished, he is beyond all measurement,
he has bewildered the King of Death, I say.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
