This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, two |thoughts::reflections, mental considerations [vitakkā]| frequently arise in the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of the Buddha [tathāgata]|, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One—the thought of |safety::security, sanctuary, peace, rest [khema]| [for beings] and the thought of |seclusion::solitude [paviveka]|. Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata delights in |benevolence::freedom from ill-will, kindness, good-heartedness [abyāpajjhā]| and is devoted to benevolence. For the Tathāgata, who delights in benevolence and is devoted to benevolence, this very thought frequently arises: ‘By this way of |living::behavior, conduct [iriyā]|, I do not |obstruct::impede, hurt, harm [byābādheti]| any being, whether |frail::trembling, with craving [tasa]| or |firm::stable, stationary, without craving [thāvara]|.'

Bhikkhus, for the Tathāgata, who delights in seclusion and is devoted to seclusion, this very thought frequently arises: Whatever is |unwholesome::unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]| has been abandoned.’

Therefore, bhikkhus, you too should dwell delighting in benevolence and devoted to benevolence. For you, bhikkhus, who dwell delighting in benevolence and devoted to benevolence, this very thought will frequently arise: ‘By this way of living, we do not obstruct any being, whether |frail::trembling, with craving [tasa]| or |firm::stable, stationary, without craving [thāvara]|.’

Dwell delighting in seclusion and devoted to seclusion. For you, bhikkhus, who dwell delighting in seclusion and devoted to seclusion, this very thought will frequently arise: 'What is unwholesome? What has yet not been |abandoned::dispelled, given up [pahīna]|? What shall we abandon?'"

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"To the Tathāgata, the Buddha who |endured the unendurable::overcome what is almost impossible to overcome [asayhasāhi]|,
two thoughts frequently arise;
The first thought mentioned is of safety [for beings],
the second thought explained is of seclusion.

The dispeller of darkness, the great sage who has reached the far shore,
the one who has attained the highest goal, who has gained control, the taintless one;
|Fully withdrawn from the poisons::crossed over the toxins of greed, hate, and illusion [visantara]|, liberated with the |wearing away of craving::depletion of desire, extinction of longing [taṇhakkhaya]|,
That sage, indeed, the bearer of his final body;
I say that he has overcome |Māra::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]|, the one who has gone beyond old age.

Just as one standing on a mountain peak,
can look upon the people in every direction;
So too, the wise one, filled with |Dhamma::the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
scaling the palace [of truth], the all seeing one;
Looks upon the people, |overcome with sorrow::afflicted with grief, immersed in sadness [sokāvatiṇṇa]|,
And, free from sorrow, he beholds those oppressed by birth and aging."

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard.
