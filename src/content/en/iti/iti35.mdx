description: The spiritual life is not lived for the purpose of deceiving people, nor for the purpose of winning favor with people, nor for the sake of acquisitions, respect, and popularity, nor for the thought 'Let people know me.' But rather, this spiritual life is lived for the purpose of restraint and for the purpose of letting go.

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the purpose of deceiving people, nor for the purpose of winning favor with people, nor for the sake of acquisitions (gain, money, profit, possessions [lābha]), honor, and fame, nor for the thought 'Let people know me.' But rather, bhikkhus, this spiritual life is lived \{for the purpose of restraint} (for the sake of self-control, following of the precepts and sense-restraint [saṃvaratthaṃ]) and \{for the purpose of letting go} (for the sake of giving up [pahānattha])."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"For the purpose of restraint, for the purpose of letting go,
the spiritual life is not \{based on tradition} (a legend, hearsay, mere talk [itiha]);
The Blessed One taught the spiritual life,
leading to and grounded upon Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]).

This is the path followed by the illustrious ones,
traveled by the great sages;
Whoever practices it,
as taught by the Buddha;
will make an end to suffering,
fulfilling the teacher's instruction."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
