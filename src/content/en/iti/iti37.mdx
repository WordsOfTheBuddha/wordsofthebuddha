This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with two qualities dwells in the here and now with abundant ease and joy, and his mind is directed towards the |wearing away::exhaustion, depletion, gradual destruction [khaya]| of the |defilements::mental outflows, taints [āsavā]|. What are the two? 1) By being moved on occasions that inspire a sense of urgency, and 2) |by wisely striving::by prudently making effort [yoniso + padhānena]| when aroused with urgency. A bhikkhu endowed with these two qualities dwells in the here and now with abundant ease and joy, and his mind is directed towards the wearing away of the mental defilements.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“On occasions that inspire a sense of urgency,
the wise should be moved;
With continuous effort, the discerning bhikkhu,
examines carefully with wisdom.

Thus dwelling with continuous effort,
peaceful and |unruffled::not agitated, not arrogant, not pompous [anuddhata]|;
Devoted to tranquility of mind,
he arrives at the end |of suffering::mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
