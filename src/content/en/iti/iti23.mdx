This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, when one quality is developed and cultivated frequently, it secures both benefits—those |pertaining to the present life::regarding this world, relevant to here and now [diṭṭhadhammika]| and those |pertaining to the hereafter::future benefits, relating to the next life or ultimate liberation [samparāyika]|. And what is that one quality? |Diligence::quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]| in wholesome states. This is the one quality that, when developed and cultivated frequently, secures both benefits—those pertaining to this life and those pertaining to the hereafter."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"The wise praise diligence,
in meritorious deeds;
Being diligent, an astute person,
secures both benefits.

The benefit visible in this life,
and the benefit pertaining to the hereafter;
Understanding what is good, the |steadfast one::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]|,
is rightly called 'wise.'"

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
