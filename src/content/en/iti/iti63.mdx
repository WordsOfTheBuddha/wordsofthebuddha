title: Addhā sutta - The Three Times
description: The Buddha speaks on how beings cling to what can be expressed—concepts and designations, including the three times of past, future, and present. Not fully understanding these, they fall under the yoke of death. But one who sees beyond conceptual fabrications touches liberation and does not resort to mental proliferation.
qualities: mental proliferation, clinging, personal existence, conceit

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

There are three times, bhikkhus. Which three? The past time, the future time, and the present time. These, bhikkhus, are the three times.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Beings who perceive what can be |expressed::said, explained, illustrated [akkheyya]|,,
become established in what can be expressed;
|Not fully understanding::not completely comprehending [apariññāya]| what can be expressed,
they come under the power of death.

But having fully understood what can be expressed,
one does not conceive ‘one who expresses’;
His mind has attained to freedom,
the |unsurpassed state of peace::incomparable tranquility, epithet of Nibbāna [santipada + + anuttara]|.

Accomplished in what can be expressed,
the peaceful one delights in the peaceful state;
Firmly established in the Dhamma, he freely makes use of concepts,
but no more resorts to |conceptualization::mental proliferation, various opinions [saṅkhyā]|.

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
