title: Addhā sutta - Time Periods
description: The Buddha speaks on how beings cling to what can be expressed—concepts and designations, including the three time periods of past, future, and present. Not fully understanding these, they fall under the yoke of death. But one who sees beyond conceptual fabrications touches liberation and does not resort to mental proliferation.

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

There are three time periods, bhikkhus. Which three? The past time period, the future time period, and the present time period. These, bhikkhus, are the three time periods.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Beings who perceive what can be |expressed::said, explained, illustrated [akkheyya]|,
become |established in::fixed in, settled in, firmly grounded in [patiṭṭhita]| what can be expressed;
|Not fully understanding::not completely comprehending [apariññāya]| what can be expressed,
they come under the yoke of death.

But having fully understood what can be expressed,
one does not conceive ‘one who expresses’;
Their mind has attained to freedom,
the |unsurpassed state of peace::incomparable tranquility, epithet of Nibbāna [santipada + anuttara]|.

Accomplished in what can be expressed,
the wise one is devoted to the peaceful state;
Firmly established in the |Dhamma::the ultimate truth that the Buddha's teachings point to [dhamma]|, they freely make use of concepts,
but no more resort to |conceptualization::mental proliferation, various opinions [saṅkhyā]|.

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
