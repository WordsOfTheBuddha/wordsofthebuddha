title: Addhā sutta - The Three Times
description: The Buddha speaks on how beings cling to what can be expressed—concepts and designations, including the three times of past, future, and present. Not fully understanding these, they fall under the yoke of death. But one who sees beyond conceptual fabrications touches liberation and does not resort to mental proliferation.

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

There are three times, bhikkhus. Which three? The past time, the future time, and the present time. These, bhikkhus, are the three times.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Perceiving what |can be expressed::can be communicated—referring not just to spoken words but to all mental designations and conceptual constructs. In this sutta, it implicitly includes temporal concepts: past, future, and present—the very categories beings grasp and identify with. To be "established in the expressible" is to be bound by such constructs, including the framework of time. Liberation arises through insight into their conditioned, fabricated nature. [akkheyya]| [through concepts],
beings take their stand on what is expressed;
|Not fully understanding::not completely comprehending [apariññāya]| the expressed,
they come under the bondage of death.

But by |fully understanding::completely comprehending [pariññāya]| the expressed,
one does not misconceive the speaker;
His mind has attained to freedom,
the |unsurpassed state of peace::incomparable tranquility, epithet of Nibbāna [santipada + + anuttara]|.

Accomplished in what can be expressed,
the peaceful one delights in the peaceful state;
Firmly established in the Dhamma, he freely makes use of concepts,
but no more resorts to |conceptualization::mental proliferation, various opinions [saṅkhyā]|.

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
