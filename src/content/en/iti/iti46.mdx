This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, you should live with |practice::training in the precepts, training guidelines [sikkhā]| as the benefit, with |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]| as the |north [star]::chief characteristic, guiding light [uttara]|, with |liberation::release, deliverance, freedom, emancipation [vimutti]| as the |essence::core, the heartwood [sāra]|, ruled by |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]|. For those bhikkhus who dwell in such a way—with training as the benefit, with wisdom as the north star, with liberation as the essence, ruled by mindfulness—one of two results is to be expected: either |final knowledge::spiritual insight [aññā]| [of full awakening] here and now, or, if there is any |residual clinging for existence::remnant of grasping for renewed becoming [upādisesa]|, the state of |non-returning::third stage of awakening where the five lower fetters of personal existence view, doubt, adherence to rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill will are permanently dropped [anāgāmitā]|.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“One who has completed the training, who is not liable to decline,
whose wisdom is supreme, |who sees the wearing away and ending of rebirth::who observes the exhaustion and cessation of rebirth [jāti+kkhayanta+dassī]|;
That sage, bearing his final body,
Having abandoned |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]|, I declare him one who has gone beyond aging.

Therefore, always delighting in |jhāna::right collectedness, stillness of mind. Read more in the [AN 5.28 - fivefold right collectedness](/an5.28) discourse. [jhāna]|, |collected::composed, settled [samāhita]|,
|with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|, who sees the wearing away and ending of rebirth;
Overcoming Māra and his army, bhikkhus,
become those who have gone beyond birth and death.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
