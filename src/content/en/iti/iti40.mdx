This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“|Ignorance::illusion of knowledge, not knowing [avijjā]|, bhikkhus, is the forerunner in the arising of unwholesome qualities, with |shamelessness::lack of conscience [ahirika]| and |moral recklessness::fearlessness of wrongdoing [anottappa]| following behind. |True knowledge::wisdom, the direct realization of truth [vijjā]|, bhikkhus, is the forerunner in the arising of wholesome qualities, with a |sense of right and wrong::sense of shame, moral conscience, modesty [hirī]| and |moral dread::fear of wrongdoing out of regard for others [ottappa]| following behind.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Whatever unfortunate destinies,
exist in this world and the next;
all are rooted in ignorance,
and accumulation of |longing::craving, desire, yearning [icchā]| and |greed::grasping [lobha]|.

When one has |evil desires::yearnings that produce harm [pāpiccha]|,
is without shame and |disrespectful::disdainful, contemptuous [anādara]|;
They produce unwholesome actions,
and as a result, fall into a |state of misery::woeful destination [apāya]|.

Therefore, abandoning |desire::intention, wish, impulse, interest [chanda]| and greed,
and dispelling ignorance;
A bhikkhu who gives rise to wisdom,
will cast off all unfortunate destinies.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
