This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the purpose of deceiving people, nor for the purpose of winning favor with people, nor for the sake of |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]|, |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|, and |popularity::fame, praise [siloka]|, nor for the thought 'Let people know me.' But rather, bhikkhus, this spiritual life is lived |for the purpose of direct knowledge::for the sake of higher understanding [abhiññattha]| and |for the purpose of full understanding::for the sake of complete comprehension [pariññattha]|.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“For the purpose of direct knowledge, for the purpose of full understanding,
the spiritual life is not based on |tradition::a legend, hearsay, mere talk [itiha]|;
The Blessed One taught the spiritual life,
leading to and grounded upon |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.

This is the path followed by the illustrious ones,
traveled by the great sages;
Whoever practices it,
as taught by the Buddha;
will make an end to suffering,
fulfilling the teacher's instruction.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
