This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with these three qualities transcends \{Māra's} (embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]) domain and shines like the sun. What three? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is endowed with: The perfected aggregate of virtue (ethical conduct, moral integrity [sīla]), the perfected aggregate of collectedness (stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]), and the perfected aggregate of wisdom (distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā])—a bhikkhu endowed with these three qualities transcends Māra's domain and shines like the sun."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"One in whom virtue, collectedness, and wisdom,
have been well cultivated;
Having transcended Māra's domain,
shines like the sun."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
