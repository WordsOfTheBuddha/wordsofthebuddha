This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with these three qualities transcends |Māra::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]|'s domain and shines like the sun. What three? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is endowed with: The perfected aggregate of |virtue::ethical conduct, moral integrity [sīla]|, the perfected aggregate of |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]|, and the perfected aggregate of |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [paññā]|—a bhikkhu endowed with these three qualities transcends Māra's domain and shines like the sun.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“One in whom virtue, collectedness, and wisdom,
have been |well cultivated::fully developed [subhāvita]|;
Having transcended Māra's domain,
shines like the sun.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
