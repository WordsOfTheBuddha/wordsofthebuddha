This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three? One like a rainless cloud, one like a cloud that rains in a certain area, and one like a cloud that rains everywhere.

And how, bhikkhus, is a person like a rainless cloud? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person gives nothing at all—to ascetics, priests, poor people, wayfarers, or beggars: no food, no drink, no clothing, no transport, no garlands, scents, or ointments, no bedding, shelter, or lighting. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is like a rainless cloud.

And how, bhikkhus, is a person like a cloud that rains in a certain area? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person gives to some but not to others—whether to ascetics, priests, poor people, wayfarers, or beggars: food, drink, clothing, transport, garlands, scents, or ointments, bedding, shelter, or lighting. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is like a cloud that rains in a certain area.

And how, bhikkhus, is a person like a cloud that rains everywhere? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person gives to all—to ascetics, priests, poor people, wayfarers, or beggars: food, drink, clothing, vehicles, garlands, scents, or ointments, bedding, shelter, or lighting. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is like a cloud that rains everywhere.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“To neither ascetics nor priests,
nor to the poor, wayfarers, or beggars;
does he share when he has obtained,
food, drink, and sustenance;
He is truly called ‘like a rainless cloud,’
that |lowest::vilest [adhama]| of persons.

To some he does not give,
to others he offers;
He is called ‘one who rains in a certain area,’
so say the wise people.

A person |who supports beggars::encourages alms giving [subhikkhavāca]|,
compassionate towards all beings;
Rejoicing, he distributes,
saying, ‘Give! Give!’

Just as a cloud, after thundering
and roaring, pours down rain,
flooding both the highlands and the lowlands,
overflowing with water—

So too, a certain person here
is of just such a kind;
Having gathered wealth righteously,
through initiative and effort;
They satisfy with food and drink,
those beggars rightly come for alms.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
