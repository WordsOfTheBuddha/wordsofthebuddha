This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three |unwholesome thoughts::unskillful thoughts, unbeneficial thinking, karmically unprofitable thoughts [akusalavitakka]|, which are blinding, produce lack of clarity, which cause ignorance, |obstruct wisdom::impede cultivation of discernment [paññānirodhika]|, which are |troublesome::afflictive [vighātapakkhika]| and not conducive to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|. Which three?

1) |Thought of sensuality::thought related to enjoyment of sensual pleasures, sexual thought [kāmavitakka]|, bhikkhus, is blinding, produces lack of clarity, causes ignorance, obstructs wisdom, is troublesome and not conducive to Nibbāna. 2) |Thought of ill will::intentional thought of mental rejection, hostility, or malevolence toward others; deliberate contemplation rooted in antipathy or wishing harm [byāpādavitakka]| is blinding, produces lack of clarity, causes ignorance, obstructs wisdom, is troublesome and not conducive to Nibbāna. 3) |Thought of harming::idea of hurting, thought of cruelty [vihiṁsāvitakka]|, bhikkhus, is blinding, produces lack of clarity, causes ignorance, obstructs wisdom, is troublesome and not conducive to Nibbāna. These, bhikkhus, are the three unwholesome thoughts, which are blinding, produce lack of clarity, cause ignorance, obstruct wisdom, which are troublesome and not conducive to Nibbāna.

Bhikkhus, there are these three wholesome thoughts, which give sight, produce clarity and create insight, grow wisdom, which are trouble-free and conducive to Nibbāna. Which three?

1) |Thought of renunciation::thought related to giving up, letting go of sense pleasures [nekkhamma + vitakka]|, bhikkhus, gives sight, produces clarity and creates insight, grows wisdom, is trouble-free and conducive to Nibbāna. 2) |Thought of good will::thought of benevolence, kindness, goodwill [abyāpādavitakka]| gives sight, produces clarity and creates insight, grows wisdom, is trouble-free and conducive to Nibbāna. 3) |Thought of harmlessness::thought of non-harming, non-violence [avihiṁsāvitakka]| gives sight, produces clarity and creates insight, grows wisdom, is trouble-free and conducive to Nibbāna. These, bhikkhus, are the three wholesome thoughts which give sight, produce clarity and create insight, grow wisdom, which are trouble-free and conducive to Nibbāna.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“He |thinks about::reflects upon, ponders over [vitakka]| the three wholesome thoughts,
and not on the three unwholesome ones;
He considers and examines the thoughts, and settles them,
just as a rainfall settles and clears away dust;
With a mind made peaceful through the calming of thoughts,
right here, he attains the |state of peace::tranquility, epithet of Nibbāna [santipada]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
