This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

"One person, bhikkhus, who has wandered and transmigrated (wandered on, moved on continuously [saṃsaranta]) for an aeon (lifespan of a world system, a vast cosmic time span [kappa]) would have accumulated a heap of bones the size of this \{Mount Vepulla} (Known today as Vipula hill, it is one of the prominent peaks surrounding the historical city of Rājagaha, present-day Rajgir in Bihar, India [vepulla + pabbata]), if they were gathered together and did not decay."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"In just one aeon,
the accumulation of a single person's bones;
Would form a heap as large as a mountain,
thus has been said by the great seer.

He described it as being,
as great as Mount Vepulla;
To the north of Vulture's Peak,
in the \{mountain stronghold} (a reference to present-day Rajgir, former capital of Magadha [giribbaja]) of Magadha.

When one sees the [four] noble truths,
\{with perfect wisdom} (with correct understanding [sammappaññāya]);
Suffering, the arising of suffering,
and the overcoming of suffering;
And the noble eightfold path,
that leads to the overcoming of suffering.

After wandering on for seven times at most,
that person;
Makes an end of suffering,
through the \{wearing away of all the fetters} (exhaustion of all the bonds [sabbasaṃyojanakkhaya])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
