This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are two behaviors that lead to suffering and rebirth in |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]| if not abandoned. What are these two? 1) One who is not celibate but |pretends to be celibate::claims to be chaste [brahmacārī + paṭiñña]|, 2) One who falsely accusses a person who is genuinely living a complete and pure celibate life of unchastity. These, bhikkhus, are the two behaviors that lead to suffering and rebirth in hell if not abandoned.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“A person who speaks falsely goes to hell,
as does one who commits wrong but denies it;
Both, after death, meet the same fate,
People of base, immoral deeds suffer hereafter.

Many who wear the |ochre::organic brown, color of Buddhist monk's robes [kāsāva]| robe,
are unrestrained and |evil-natured::one who has had a long association of harmful mental qualities - of negligence, laziness, having many wishes, irrational application of mind, lack of situational awareness, having bad friends, pursuing bad habits [pāpadhamma]|;
By performing |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| actions,
the evil-doer |re-arises::is reborn [upapajjati]| in hell.

Better to swallow an iron ball,
blazing like a fiery flame;
Than for an |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]| and unrestrained person,
to consume alms given by the people.

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
