This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three |defilements::outflows, discharges, taints [āsavā]|. What three? The |taint of sensual desire::oozing sensual desire [kāmāsava]|, the |taint of becoming::effluent of being, taint of existence [bhavāsava]|, and the |taint of ignorance::taint of not knowing how things have come to be, illusion of knowing, distorted perception [avijjāsava]|. These are the three defilements.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“|Collected::composed, settled [samāhita]|, |fully aware::with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]|,
a |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]| disciple of the Buddha;
|Discerns::distinguishes, understands, knows clearly [pajānāti]| the defilements,
and the |arising::origin, source [sambhava]| of defilements.

Where these |cease::vanish, reach an end [nirujjhati]|,
and the way of practice |leading to their cessation::leading to exhaustion, leading to wearing away [khayagāmī]|;
With the cessation of defilements, the bhikkhu,
is |satiated::free from craving, desireless [nicchāta]| and |completely quenched [of mental defilements]::completely cooled mental defilements [parinibbuto]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
