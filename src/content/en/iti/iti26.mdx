This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, if |sentient beings::living beings [satta]| knew, as I know, the fruit of giving and sharing, they would not eat without first sharing, nor would the stain of stinginess occupy their minds. Even if it were their last morsel, their last mouthful, they would not consume it without sharing if there were anyone to receive it. But because sentient beings do not know, as I know, the fruit of giving and sharing, they eat without sharing, and the |stain of stinginess::tarnish of selfishness [maccheramala]| |occupies::obsesses, controls [pariyādāya]| their minds.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“If sentient beings only knew,
as aforementioned by the great sage;
The result of |sharing::donation, distribution, doling out [saṃvibhāga]|,
and how it yields great fruit.

Having removed the stain of stinginess,
with a |clear and settled::calm, tranquil [vippasanna]| mind;
They would give to the Noble Ones at the proper time,
where the gift bears great fruit.

Having given food in abundance,
and gifts to those worthy of gifts;
After passing away from this human state,
the givers go to heaven.

And having gone to heaven,
they enjoy all the pleasures they desire;
They experience the fruit of having given,
|free of stinginess::free from avarice, without covetousness [amacchara]|.

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
