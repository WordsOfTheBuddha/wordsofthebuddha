This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, without directly knowing, without completely comprehending |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|, with the mind |not detaching::not losing interest, not losing desire for, remaining passionate [avirājayanta]| from it, and |without abandoning::not giving up, not letting go of [appajahaṁ]| it, one is incapable of ending suffering. Indeed bhikkhus, by directly knowing and completely comprehending conceit, with the mind detaching from it, and by abandoning it, one is capable of ending suffering.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“This generation is |possessed by pride::endowed with conceit [mānupeta]|,
bound by the |knot of conceit::bond of ego [mānagantha]|, they delight in |existence::being, becoming; continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|;
Not fully understanding conceit,
they will come to renewed existence.

But those who have completely comprehended conceit,
freed through the exhaustion of conceit;
They have conquered the tie of conceit,
and have gone beyond all stress.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
