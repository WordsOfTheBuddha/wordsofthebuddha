This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single fetter, |fettered by::bound by, tied to [saṃyutta]| which, beings have wandered on and undergone |repeated existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]| for a long time, as does this fetter of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|. Indeed, bhikkhus, fettered by craving, beings have wandered on and undergone repeated existence for a long time.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“A person with craving as their companion,
transmigrates for a long time;
From one state of |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]| to another,
they do not go beyond cyclic existence.

Having understood this |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| clearly,
that craving leads to the |arising::origin, source [sambhava]| of |suffering::mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa]|;
Free from craving and |not grasping::not taking anything as one's own [anādāna]|,
a bhikkhu should wander mindfully.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
