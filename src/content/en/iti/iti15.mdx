This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single fetter by which beings are bound that causes them to wander and |transmigrate::wandering on, moving on continuously [saṃsarati]| for a long time as does this fetter of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|. Indeed bhikkhus, fettered by craving, beings wander and transmigrate for a long time."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"A person with craving as their companion,
transmigrates for a long time;
From one state of existence to another,
they do not go beyond |cyclic existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]|.

Having understood this |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| clearly,
that craving leads to the |arising::origin, source [sambhava]| |of suffering::mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa]|;
Free from craving and |not grasping::not taking anything as one's own [anādāna]|,
a bhikkhu should wander mindfully."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
