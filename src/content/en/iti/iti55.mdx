This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three |quests::searches, pursuits [esanā]|. What three? The quest for seeking sensual pleasure, the quest for |renewed existence::seeking existence [bhavesanā]|, and the quest for |seeking renunciation::seeking spiritual life [brahmacariyesanā]|. These are the three quests.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“The quest for seeking sensual pleasure, the quest for renewed existence,
along with the quest for seeking renunciation; 
Result from |holding tight to the thought, 'This is the truth'::clutching something as the truth [saccaparāmāsa]|,
and the accumulation of |bases for views::grounds for views, opinions, beliefs [diṭṭhiṭṭhānā]|.

For one |detached from all passion::with desire faded away [sabbarāgaviratta]|,
|who is liberated through the exhaustion of craving::who is released through the depletion of desire [taṇhakkhayavimutti]|;
Quests are |renounced::given up, relinquished [paṭinissaṭṭha]|,
and the bases for views are |uprooted::eradicated [samūhata]|;
With the cessation of quests, the bhikkhu,
is |fulfilled::free from hope, desire-less [nirāsa]| and |without doubt::without confusion [akathaṅkathī]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
