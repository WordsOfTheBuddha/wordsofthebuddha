This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“These three things, bhikkhus, lead to the |decline::regression, deterioration [parihāna]| of a |trainee::learner, one of the seven stages of a noble person before full awakening [sekha]| bhikkhu. What three? Here, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu: 1) |takes pleasure in work::enjoys activity/work [kammārāma]|, indulges in work, and is habitually engaged in work; 2) takes pleasure in talk, indulges in talk, and is habitually engaged in talk; 3) takes pleasure in sleep, indulges in sleep, and is habitually engaged in sleep. These are the three things, bhikkhus, that lead to the decline of a trainee bhikkhu.

These three things, bhikkhus, lead to non-decline of a trainee bhikkhu. What three? Here, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu: 1) does not take pleasure in work, does not indulge in work, and is not habitually devoted to work; 2) does not take pleasure in talk, does not indulge in talk, and is not habitually devoted to talk; 3) does not take pleasure in sleep, does not indulge in sleep, and is not habitually devoted to sleep. These are the three things, bhikkhus, that lead to the non-decline of a trainee bhikkhu.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“A bhikkhu who takes pleasure in work, in talk,
in sleep, and is |restless::agitated, unbalanced, confused about what is right and wrong [uddhata]|;
Such a one is incapable of,
attaining the |highest awakening::supreme enlightenment [sambodhimuttama]|.

Therefore, the one |with few obligations::with few duties, unencumbered [appakicca]|,
seldom drowsy, unagitated in mind;
That kind of bhikkhu is indeed fit,
to attain the highest awakening.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
