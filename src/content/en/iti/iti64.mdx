This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“There are three kinds of misconduct, bhikkhus. Which three? |Bodily misconduct::killing living beings, harming others, theft, or sexual misconduct [kāyaduccarita]|, |verbal misconduct::false speech, harsh speech, divisive speech, idle chatter [vacīduccarita]|, and |mental misconduct::yearning with strong eagerness and desire, having ill will or hatred, delighting in harm [manoduccarita]|. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of misconduct.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having engaged in bodily misconduct,
and verbal misconduct;
and mental misconduct,
and whatever else is |faulty::corrupt, defective [dosasaṁhita]|—

Not having done wholesome deeds,
and having done much unwholesome;
With the breakup of the body, the |undiscerning one::immature person, one lacking in discernment, one who has not cultivated wisdom [duppañña]|,
is reborn in |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
