This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, abandon one thing; I am your guarantor for non-returning. What one thing? Bhikkhus, abandon |contempt::ungratefulness, depreciation, denigration, disrespect, belittlement, disparagement [makkha]|; I am your guarantor for non-returning."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Overcome by contempt, through which,
beings go to an unfortunate destination;
Completely comprehending that contempt,
those seeing clearly abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not return,
to this world at any time."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
