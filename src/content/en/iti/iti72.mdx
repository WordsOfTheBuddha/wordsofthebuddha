This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three elements of escape. What three? 1) |Renunciation::going out state, rejection of sensual pleasure [nekkhamma]| is the escape from sensual pleasures, 2) the |formless existence::immaterial state [āruppa]| is the escape from |forms::visible objects such as beautiful sights, faces, expressions, art, ornaments, possessions, status symbols, admired appearances, enticing scenery, or objects of desire and attachment [rūpe]|, and for 3) whatever is |conditioned::constructed, created, fabricated [saṅkhata]|, |dependently arisen::casually produced, arisen together from a cause [paṭiccasamuppanna]|—its cessation is the escape from it. These, bhikkhus, are the three elements of escape.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having known the escape from sensual pleasures,
and the |surpassing::transcending, overcoming [atikkama]| of forms;
One |with continuous effort::ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]|,
reaches |the stilling of all formations::calming of all intentions, volitions, mental activities [sabbasaṅkhārasamatha]|.

Such a bhikkhu, |seeing correctly::understanding perfectly [sammaddasa]|,
is thereby well-released;
Attained to perfect understanding, at peace,
the |sage::seer, hermit, monk [munī]| has overcome all bonds.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
