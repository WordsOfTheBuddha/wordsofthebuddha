This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three qualities that are internal impurities, internal enemies, internal foes—they injure from within and act as internal adversaries. What three? 1) |Greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]|, bhikkhus, is an internal impurity, internal enemy, internal foe—it injures from within and acts as internal adversary. 2) |Aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, bhikkhus, is an internal impurity, internal enemy, internal foe—it injures from within and acts as internal adversary. 3) |illusion::delusion, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; it fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|, bhikkhus, is an internal impurity, internal enemy, internal foe—it injures from within and acts as internal adversary. These, bhikkhus, are the three qualities that are internal impurities, internal enemies, internal foes—they injure from within and act as internal adversaries.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Greed is a cause of |harm::misfortune, damage, injury, hurt, detriment [anattha]|,
it stirs and agitates the mind;
A danger born from within,
yet people |fail to discern it::cannot see it for what it is [nāvabujjhati]|.

The greedy one knows not what is good,
for he does not see the |Dhamma::the ultimate truth that the Buddha’s teachings point to [dhamma]|;
Blinding darkness arises at that moment,
when greed |overcomes::overpowers, subdues [sahati]| a person.

For one who has abandoned greed,
who is unmoved by |alluring objects::desirable things [lobhaneyya]|;
From him, greed falls away entirely,
like water drops from a lotus leaf.

Aversion is a bringer of harm,
it stirs and agitates the mind;
A danger born from within,
yet people fail to discern it.

The |corrupt::spoiled, seduced, festering, angry, evil [duṭṭha]| one knows not what is good,
for he does not see the Dhamma;
Blinding darkness arises at that moment,
when aversion overpowers a person.

For one who has abandoned aversion,
who is unmoved by |provoking things::detestable objects [dosaneyya]|;
From him, aversion falls away entirely,
Like a ripe palm fruit from its stalk.

Illusion is a bringer of harm,
it stirs and agitates the mind;
A danger born from within,
yet people fail to discern it.

The deluded one knows not what is good,
for he does not see the Dhamma;
Blinding darkness arises at that moment,
when illusion overpowers a person.

For one who has abandoned illusion,
who is unmoved by |misleading appearances::infatuating influences, things that cloud the mind [mohaneyya]|;
From him, illusion falls away entirely,
like the rising sun dispels the darkness.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
