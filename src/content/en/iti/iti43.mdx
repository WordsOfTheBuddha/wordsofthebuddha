This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there is the |unborn::unproduced [ajāta]|, |unbecome::without becoming [abhūta]|, |unmade::not created [akata]|, |unconditioned::not created, unconstructed, unformed, epithet of Nibbāna [asaṅkhata]|. If there were not the unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, there would be no discernment of escape from the born, become, made, conditioned. But since there is the unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, therefore the |escape::way out, remedy [nissaraṇa]| from the born, become, made, conditioned is |discerned::clearly known, become evident [paññāyati]|.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“That which is born, become, arisen,
made, and conditioned is |not enduring::not eternal [addhuva]|;
A |conglomeration::assemblage, accumulation, mass [saṅghāṭa]| of aging and dying,
a nest of disease, |fragile::perishable [pabhaṅgura]|.

That which arises from the nourishment and guide [of craving],
it is not suitable to be pleased with that;
Its escape is peaceful,
|beyond the realm of conjecture::outside the realm of thought, beyond logic [atakkāvacara]|, and enduring.

The unborn, unarisen,
sorrowless, and stainless state;
The ending of suffering,
the |stilling of mental activities::quieting of conditions [saṅkhāra + upasama]| is ease.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
