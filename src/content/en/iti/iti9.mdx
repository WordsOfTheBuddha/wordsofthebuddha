This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, without directly knowing, without completely comprehending |greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]|, with the mind |not detaching::not losing interest, not losing desire for, remaining passionate [avirājayanta]| from it, and |without abandoning::not giving up, not letting go of [appajahaṁ]| it, one is incapable of ending suffering.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Overcome by greed, through which,
beings go to an unfortunate destination;
Completely comprehending greed,
those seeing clearly abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not return,
to this world at any time.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
