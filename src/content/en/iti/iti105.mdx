This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these four uprisings of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|, where craving, as it arises in a bhikkhu, |accrues::goes up, becomes available as a fuel for further actions [uppajjati]|. What four? 1) Craving arises in a bhikkhu for the sake of a robe; 2) craving arises in a bhikkhu for the sake of alms food; 3) craving arises in a bhikkhu for the sake of lodging; 4) craving arises in a bhikkhu for the sake of this or that state of |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|. These, bhikkhus, are the four uprisings of craving where craving arising in a bhikkhu accrues.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“A person with craving as their companion,
transmigrates for a long time;
From one state of existence to another,
they do not go beyond |cyclic existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]|.

Having understood this |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]| clearly,
that craving leads to the |arising::origin, source [sambhava]| of suffering;
Free from craving and |not grasping::not taking anything as one's own [anādāna]|,
a bhikkhu should wander mindfully.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
