This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of craving. What three? Craving for sensual pleasures, \|craving for becoming::craving for existence, craving for something to be [bhavataṇhā]|, and \|craving for non-becoming::craving for annhilation, craving for something to not exist [vibhavataṇhā]|. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of craving."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Fettered by the bond of craving,
with minds inflamed by lust for becoming and non-becoming;
Under the influence of Māra's snare,
these people find no security from bondage;
Sentient beings continue \|in cyclic existence::wandering on, moving on continuously, passing from one state of existence to another, stream of existence [saṃsāra]|,
leading to birth and death.

But those who have given up craving,
free from desire for repeated existence;
They in this world have truly crossed over,
with the \|wearing away of the taints::gradual exhaustion and elimination of the mental defilements or deep-seated afflictions such as sensual desire, craving for existence, views, and ignorance [āsava + khaya]|."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
