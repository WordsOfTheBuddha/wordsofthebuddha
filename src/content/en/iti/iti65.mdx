This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“There are three kinds of good conduct, bhikkhus. Which three? |Bodily good conduct::good physical conduct, virtuous bodily behavior [kāyasucarita]|, |verbal good conduct::applying the five factors of well-spoken speech - 1) speaking at the proper time, 2) being truthful, 3) being gentle, 4) speaking beneficially, and 5) speaking with a mind of loving-kindness [vacīsucarita]|, and |mental good conduct::being with thoughts of renunciation, non-ill-will, and non-harm [manosucarita]|. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of good conduct.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having abandoned bodily misconduct,
and verbal misconduct;
and mental misconduct,
and whatever else is |faulty::corrupt, defective [dosasaṁhita]|—

Not having done unwholesome deeds,
and having done much wholesome;
With the breakup of the body, the |discerning one::wise person, one who has cultivated wisdom [sappañña]|,
is reborn in |heaven::a place of happiness, lit. good fortune [sagga]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
