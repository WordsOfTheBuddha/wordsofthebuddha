This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three |quests::searches, pursuits [esanā]|. What three? The quest for seeking sensual pleasure, the quest for |renewed existence::seeking existence [bhavesanā]|, and the quest for |seeking renunciation::seeking spiritual life [brahmacariyesanā]|. These are the three quests.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“|Collected::composed, settled [samāhita]| and |fully aware::clearly comprehending [sampajāna]|,
the |mindful::remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]| disciple of the Buddha;
Understands quests,
and the source of quests.

Where these [quests] |cease::finish, vanish, reach an end [nirujjhati]|,
and the way of practice |leading to their cessation::leading to their wearing away [khayagāmī]|;
With the cessation of quests, the bhikkhu,
is |satiated::free from craving, desireless [nicchāta]| and |completely quenched [of mental defilements]::completely cooled mental defilements [parinibbuta]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
