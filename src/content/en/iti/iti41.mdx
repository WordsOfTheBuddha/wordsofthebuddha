This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Those sentient beings are truly deprived, bhikkhus, who are lacking in noble wisdom. In this very life, they dwell in |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|, with annoyance, hardship, and distress. After the breakup of the body, after death, a |bad destination::state of misery [duggati]| is to be expected. Those sentient beings are not deprived who are not lacking in noble wisdom. In this very life, they dwell in |ease::contentment, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]|, without annoyance, hardship, or distress. After the breakup of the body, after death, a |good destination::fortunate condition (of rebirth) [sugati]| is to be expected."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Due to the decline in wisdom,
look at the world, including the gods—
Entrenched in |name and form::combination of mental processes [intending, attention, contact, sensation, and perceiving] and physical form that constitute an individual being, the mental and physical objects of consciousness [nāmarūpa]|,
they |think::presume, suppose, imagine, conceive [maññati]| it to be reality.

Wisdom is foremost in the world,
as it culminates in breakthrough;
Through it, one rightly understands,
the |exhaustion of birth and existence::extinction of rebirth and becoming [jātibhavaparikkhaya]|.

Gods and human long for them,
the Awakened Ones, ever |mindful::fully present [satīmant]|;
|of joyful wisdom::with an intelligent sense of humor [hāsapañña]|,
who bear their final body."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
