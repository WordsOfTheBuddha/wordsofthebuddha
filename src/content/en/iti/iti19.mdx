This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, one thing arises in the world |for the benefit of many people::that brings well-being, advantage, and good outcomes for many [bahujanahitāya]| and |for the happiness of many people::leads to joy, ease, and comfort for many [bahujanasukhāya]|. It arises |for the sake of::for the purpose of [atthāya]|, for the |benefit of::good of, welfare of [hitāya]| and for the |ease of::comfort of, contentment of [sukhāya]| both gods and humans. What is this one thing? It is the |harmony in the monastic community, unity within the Saṅgha::concord within the community [saṅghasāmaggī]|. When the community is unified, bhikkhus, there are no mutual quarrels, no mutual abuse, no exclusion, and no abandonment of one another. In such a situation, those |without confidence::who are non-believers [appasannā]| gain confidence, and those who have confidence increase their confidence.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Harmony in the community brings ease,
and supporting the unified brings further joy;
One who enjoys unity and is firmly established in the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
does not fall away from peace and security;
Having established the community in harmony,
one rejoices in heaven for an |aeon::lifespan of a world system, a vast cosmic time span [kappa]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
