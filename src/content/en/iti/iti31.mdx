This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these two qualities that do not cause remorse. What are the two? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person has done good, has done what is |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]|, has protected others from fear, has not done evil, has not done cruelty, and has not done misdeeds. He does not feel remorse thinking, 'I have done what is good,' and he does not feel remorse thinking, 'I have not done what is evil.' Bhikkhus, these are the two qualities that do not cause remorse.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

Having abandoned bad conduct by body,
and by speech;
Having abandoned bad conduct by mind,
and other actions associated with |blame::ill-will, hate, resentment [dosa]|.

Not having performed unwholesome actions,
but having performed many wholesome ones;
At the breaking up of the body, the wise one,
|arises::is reborn, re-arises, appears as if placed [upapajjati]| in heaven."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
