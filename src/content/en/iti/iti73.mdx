This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, the formless [existence] is more peaceful than the form realm. Yet, |cessation::stilling of all thought formations, ending of all created, conditioned, dependently arisen things [nirodha]| is more peaceful than the formless existence.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Those beings who reach the form realm,
and those |established in the formless::settled in immaterial states [arūpaṭṭhāyī]|;
Not knowing cessation—
they are arrivers to |renewed existence::future life [punabbhava]|.

|Completely comprehending::fully understanding [pariññāya]| forms,
and |not caught in::not fixed in, not attached to [asaṇṭhita]| the formless;
Those who are liberated in cessation,
are the ones |who have gone beyond death::who have transcended mortality [maccuhāyino]|.

Touching the deathless element with the body,
having reached the state |free from attachment::free from grasping, not taking as mine, not appropriating [nirūpadhi]|;
|Abandoning all identification::relinquishing all appropriation, giving up acquisitions [upadhippaṭinissagga]|,
having personally realized the |taint-less::undefiled, free from effluents [anāsava]|;
The perfectly Awakened One teaches,
the sorrow-free, |unblemished::pure, stainless [viraja]| state.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
