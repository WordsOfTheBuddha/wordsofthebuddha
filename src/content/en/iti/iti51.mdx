This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“There are these three elements, bhikkhus. The |form element::objects of vision, materials, including the realm and objects of subtle materiality [rūpadhātu]|, the |formless element::states not rooted in materiality, including mental realms and meditative attainments beyond physical form [arūpadhātu]| and the |element of cessation::the complete ending of conditioned phenomena, including the cessation of perception and feeling, leading to Nibbāna [nirodhadhātu]|. These, bhikkhus, are the three elements.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“|Completely comprehending::fully understanding [pariññāya]| the element of form,
And |not caught in::not fixed in, not attached to [asaṇṭhita]| the formless element;
Those who are freed through cessation,
Are the ones |who have gone beyond death::who have transcended mortality [maccuhāyino]|.

Contacting the |deathless::deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amata]| with the body,
having reached the state |free from attachment::free from grasping, not taking as mine, not appropriating [nirūpadhi]|;
Through |relinquishing of acquisitions::abandoning of identification [upadhippaṭinissagga]|,
free from the taints, they |personally experience::realize for oneself [sacchikatvā]| [the truth];
The |perfectly Awakened One::fully awakened being, fully enlightened being [sammāsambuddha]| teaches,
the sorrow-free, |unblemished::pure, stainless [viraja]| path.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
