This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are |accomplished in virtue::of excellent morality; accomplished in virtue [sīlasampanna]|, |accomplished in collectedness::accomplished in stability of mind, skilled in mental stillness [samādhisampanna]|, accomplished in wisdom, |accomplished in liberation::skilled in release, successful in freedom [vimuttisampanna]|, accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation; who are advisors, instructors, explainers, encouragers, inspirers, gladdeners, competent teachers of the true |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| — I say, bhikkhus, that seeing such bhikkhus is of great benefit; listening to them is of great benefit; approaching them is of great benefit; attending upon them is of great benefit; recollecting them is of great benefit; and going forth under them is of great benefit. And what is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, even if one’s aggregate of virtue is not yet fully perfected, through associating with, attending upon, and honoring such bhikkhus, it progresses towards completion through |cultivation::development, meditation [bhāvanā]|. Likewise, one’s aggregate of collectedness, one’s aggregate of wisdom, one’s aggregate of liberation, and one’s aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation — even if not yet complete — progresses towards completion through cultivation. And such bhikkhus as these are called teachers, caravan leaders, those who have abandoned conflict, dispellers of darkness, illuminators, radiant ones, illuminators, light bringers, torch-bearers, light-makers, Noble Ones, and those possessing vision.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“This is a cause for |joy::cheerfulness, gladness; a fresh and mild happiness arising from a sense of spiritual well-being and a clear conscience [pāmojja]|,
for those who understand;
[The sight of] those who are |well-trained::awakened; lit. developed self [bhāvitatta]|,
The Noble Ones who live the Dhamma.

They illuminate the true Dhamma,
shining forth as bringers of light;
The |steadfast ones::intelligent ones, stable, wise [dhīrā]|, givers of light,
seers who have abandoned conflict.

Having heard their teaching,
the wise, through perfect understanding;
Directly knowing the ending of rebirth,
come no more to renewed |existence::being, becoming; continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
