This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, 1) one who is |bound to the yoke of sensual pleasures::under the sway of sensuality [kāmayogayutta]| and bound to the yoke of [continued conditioned] existence is a returner, a returner to the |present state of existence::earthly existence [itthatta]|. 2) One who is detached from the yoke of sensual pleasures but bound to the yoke of continued conditional existence is a |non-returner::third stage of awakening where the lower five fetters of 1] personal existence, i.e. view that one is an embodied being, 2] doubt, perplexity, or indecisiveness, 3] adherence to rules and observances as a means of liberation, 4] sensual desire and 5] ill will are completely overcome [anāgāmī]|, not a returner to the present state of existence. 3) One who is detached from the yoke of sensual pleasures and also detached from the yoke of continued conditional existence is an |Arahant::a worthy one, an epithet of a fully awakened being [arahant]|, |whose mental defilements are ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Entangled in sensual pleasures,
bound to the yoke of continued conditional existence, as well as both;
Beings wander on in |cyclic existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]|,
|bound for birth and death::headed toward repeated birth and dying [jātimaraṇagāmī]|.

But those who have abandoned sensual pleasures,
yet have not reached the wearing away of taints;
Though still entangled in becoming,
they are called non-returners.

But those who are freed from doubt,
who have eradicated |pride::conceit, egotism, superiority, comparing oneself [māna]| and the potential for renewed existence;
They are the ones who have gone beyond the world,
those who have reached the wearing away of taints.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
