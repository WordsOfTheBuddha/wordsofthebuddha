This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, when a deity is due to pass away from the host of gods, five |preceding signs::portents, omens [pubbanimittā]| appear: their garland withers, their clothes become stained, sweat exudes from their armpits, their physical radiance fades, and they no longer delight in their divine seat. Then, knowing that ‘this young deity is bound to pass away,’ the other gods address him with three statements: ‘Go from here, friend, to a good destination.

Having gone to a good destination, gain a fortunate acquisition.

Having gained a fortunate acquisition, may you become |firmly grounded::well established [suppatiṭṭhita]|.’”

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: “But what, venerable sir, is regarded by the gods as a 'going to a good destination'?

What is regarded by the gods as a 'fortunate acquisition'?

And what is regarded by the gods as becoming 'firmly grounded'?”

“Human state, bhikkhu, is regarded by the gods as a 'going to a good destination.'

When, having become human, one gains |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]| in the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| and |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]| proclaimed by the |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|—this is regarded by the gods as a fortunate acquisition.

And when that faith becomes deeply rooted, firmly grounded, |unshakeable::unassailable [asaṃhāriya]|—not to be shaken by any recluse, priest, god, |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]|, |Brahmā::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahmā]|, or anyone in the world—this is what is regarded by the gods as becoming well established.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“When a deity from the host of gods,
passes away, their lifespan spent;
Three utterances arise,
a blessing from rejoicing gods—

‘Go from here, friend, to a good destination,
to dwell among humankind;
And having become human, may you gain,
unsurpassed faith in the |good Dhamma::good teaching, true doctrine [saddhamma]|.

May that faith, once planted in you,
take root and be firmly grounded;
For your whole life, unshakable—
in the Dhamma, well proclaimed.

Having given up bodily misconduct,
and misconduct in speech;
Giving up the mind’s misdeeds too,
and all that is tainted by defilement.

Doing what’s good with the body,
much good through one’s speech,
and with the mind acting in purity—
|boundless::limitless, immeasurable [appamāṇa]| and |free from attachment::free from grasping, not taking as mine, not appropriating [nirūpadhi]|.

Then, having made merit |associated with acquisitions::connected with material acquisitions and attachment [opadhika]|,
through generous giving, vast merit accrued;
May you guide other mortals as well,
in the good Dhamma and in the spiritual life.

Out of such |compassion::benevolence, concern, gentle regard [anukampā]|, the gods,
when they see a deity passing away,
rejoice and bless with these words:
‘Come again, deva—return once more!’”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
