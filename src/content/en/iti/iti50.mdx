This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"There are these three roots of the unwholesome, bhikkhus. What are the three? |Greed::lust, wanting, desire [lobha]| is a root of the unwholesome, |aversion::ill-will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]| is a root of the unwholesome, |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]| is a root of the unwholesome. These, bhikkhus, are the three roots of the unwholesome."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Greed, aversion, and delusion,
afflict the person with a |corrupt mind::evil-minded, a mind with defilements [pāpacetasa]|;
They arise from within and harm him,
like a banana tree being destroyed by its own fruit."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
