This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“There are these three roots of the unwholesome, bhikkhus. What are the three? |Greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]| is a root of the unwholesome, |aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]| is a root of the unwholesome, |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misapprehension, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]| is a root of the unwholesome. These, bhikkhus, are the three roots of the unwholesome.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Greed, aversion, and illusion,
afflict the person with a |corrupt mind::evil-minded, a mind with defilements [pāpacetasa]|;
They arise from within and harm him,
like a banana tree being destroyed by its own fruit.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
