Thus have I heard—At The Blessed One, the Worthy One, has spoken thus:

“There are, bhikkhus, two |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]| elements. What are the two? The Nibbāna element with fuel remaining and the Nibbāna element with no fuel remaining.

And what, bhikkhus, is the Nibbāna element with fuel remaining? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is an |Arahant::a worthy one, an epithet of a fully awakened being [arahant]|, with taints eradicated, having lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the ultimate goal, severed the fetters of existence, and is fully liberated through right |wisdom::complete comprehension of how things have come to be|. However, his five sense faculties still operate. Because of their operation without impairment, he experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, and feels pleasure and pain. The ending of |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|, the ending of |aversion::ill will, hatred, hostility, mental attitude of rejection, fault-finding, resentful disapproval [dosa]|, the ending of |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misapprehension, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]| — this is called, bhikkhus, the Nibbāna element with fuel remaining.

And what, bhikkhus, is the Nibbāna element without fuel remaining? In this case, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is an Arahant, with taints eradicated, having lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the ultimate goal, severed the fetters of existence, and is fully liberated through right wisdom. For him, bhikkhus, right here, all sensations will be cooled and delighted in any longer. This is called, bhikkhus, the Nibbāna element without fuel remaining. These, bhikkhus, are the two elements of Nibbāna.”

The Blessed One spoke thus, it is said:

“These two elements of Nibbāna were clarified
By the one with insight, detached and serene.
The first element pertains to this current life,
it is what remains when the bond to rebirth is broken;
The second element pertains to beyond this life,
where all states of existence utterly cease.

Those who, understanding this, attain the unconditioned state,
their minds liberated, the bond to rebirth broken;
reaching the essence of the Dhamma, delighting in its cessation,
such balanced ones relinquish all states of existence.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
