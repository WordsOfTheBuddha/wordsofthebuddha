This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, whatever bhikkhus are |deceitful::deceptive, fraudulent, fake [kuha]|, |stubborn::bullheaded, inflexible [thaddha]|, talkative, crafty, |arrogant::conceited, haughty [unnaḷa]|, and |distracted::with scattered attention, not collected, not well-composed [asamāhita]|; such bhikkhus are not my true disciples. They have deviated from this |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| and |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|; and they do not achieve growth, progress, or full development in it. But, bhikkhus, those monks who are honest, restrained in speech, |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]|, humble, and |well composed::completely calm, totally settled, attentive, completely collected [susamāhita]| [in mind]; these are truly my disciples. They have not strayed from this Dhamma and Vinaya; and they do attain growth, progress, and full maturity within it.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Deceitful, stubborn, talkative, and crafty,
arrogant and distracted;
Such do not grow in the Dhamma,
preached by the perfectly Awakened One.

But those who are honest, quiet, steadfast,
humble and collected in mind;
They indeed grow in the Dhamma,
preached by the perfectly Awakened One.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
