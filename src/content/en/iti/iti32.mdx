This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, a person endowed with two |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| is cast into |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|, just as if they were carried and |placed::dropped, set aside [nikkhitta]| there. Which two? |Harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| conduct and harmful |views::concepts, theories, attitudes, philosophies [diṭṭhiyā]|. Indeed, bhikkhus, a person endowed with these two mental qualities is cast into hell, just as if they were carried and placed there.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Harmful conduct,
and harmful views;
Whoever is endowed,
with these two mental qualities;
After the breaking up of the body, that |undiscerning person::immature person, one lacking in discernment, one who has not cultivated wisdom [duppañña]|,
is reborn in hell.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
