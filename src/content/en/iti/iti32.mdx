This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"A person endowed with two |mental qualities::mental characteristics, traits [dhamma]| is cast into |hell::a place of intense suffering [niraya]|, just as if they were carried and |placed::dropped, set aside [nikkhitta]| there. Which two? |Harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| conduct and harmful |views::concepts, theories, attitudes, philosophies [diṭṭhiyā]|. Indeed, bhikkhus, a person endowed with these two mental qualities is cast into hell, just as if they were carried and placed there."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Harmful conduct,
and harmful views;
Whoever is endowed,
with these two mental qualities;
After the breakup of the body, the |undiscerning person::immature person, one lacking in discernment, one who has not cultivated wisdom [duppañña]|,
is reborn in hell."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
