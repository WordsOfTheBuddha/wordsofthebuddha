This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who, overcome by |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]| and with minds overwhelmed, upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a |bad destination::state of misery [duggati]|, in the |realms of downfall::in realms of misery [vinipāta]|, even in |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|.

Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who, overcome by |disrespect::disregard [asakkāra]| and with minds overwhelmed, upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a bad destination, in the realms of downfall, even in hell.

Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who, overcome by both respect and disrespect, and with minds overwhelmed, upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a bad destination, in the realms of downfall, even in hell.

But, bhikkhus, I do not say this having heard it from another ascetic or brahmin. Moreover, bhikkhus, what I have known for myself, seen for myself, and realized for myself, that is what I declare.

Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who, overcome by respect and with minds overwhelmed, upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a bad destination, in the realms of downfall, even in hell.

Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who, overcome by disrespect and with minds overwhelmed, upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a bad destination, in the realms of downfall, even in hell.

Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who, overcome by both respect and disrespect, and with minds overwhelmed, upon the breaking up of the body, after death, have arisen in a state of loss, a bad destination, in the realms of downfall, even in hell.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“While being honored,
or shown dishonor, or by both;
For one whose |collectedness::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]| does not waver,
as he dwells with a boundless mind —

That one, meditative and |practicing continuously::diligent, persevering, consistent [sātatika]|,
refined in vision and insight;
Delighting in the ending of grasping,
is called a |true person::good person, worthy one, awakened being [sappurisa]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
