This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, a person endowed with two |mental qualities::characteristics, traits, and tendencies of the mind, shaped by repeated actions and sustained attention, guided by particular ways of understanding; they may be wholesome or unwholesome, bright or dark [dhammā]| is cast into |heaven::a blissful realm, celestial world [sagga]|, just as if they were carried and |placed::dropped, set aside [nikkhitta]| there. Which two? |Auspicious::fine, excellent [bhaddaka]| conduct and auspicious |views::concepts, theories, attitudes, philosophies [diṭṭhiyā]|. Indeed, bhikkhus, a person endowed with these two mental qualities is cast into heaven, just as if they were carried and placed there."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"By auspicious conduct,
and by auspicious views;
Whoever is endowed,
with these two mental qualities;
After the breakup of the body, that wise person,
is reborn in heaven."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
