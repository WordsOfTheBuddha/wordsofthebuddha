This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, and Thus have I heard:

“There are three kinds of persons who arise in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans. What three? Here, bhikkhus, a |Tathāgata::one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of a perfectly Awakened One [tathāgata]|, an Arahant, a perfectly Awakened One arises in the world, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, who has reached the destination, knower of the world, unsurpassed guide of trainable persons, teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, Fortunate One. He teaches the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| that is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a spiritual life that is entirely perfect and pure. This, bhikkhus, is the first kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.

Again, bhikkhus, a disciple of that same teacher is an Arahant |whose mental defilements have ended::who is awakened through the complete exhaustion of the mental effluents, taints [khīṇāsava]|, who has fulfilled one’s training, who has done what needs to be done, who has put down the burden, who has achieved the highest goal, |who has exhausted the fetter of existence::who has worn away the bonds of continued conditional existence, i.e. the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojana]|, and who is liberated through complete comprehension. He teaches the Dhamma that is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with both the meaning and the phrasing; he proclaims the spiritual life that is entirely complete and pure. This, bhikkhus, is the second kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.

Further, bhikkhus, a disciple of that same teacher who is a trainee, on the path, learned, and endowed with virtuous conduct. He also teaches the Dhamma that is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with both the meaning and the phrasing; he proclaims the spiritual life that is entirely complete and pure. This, bhikkhus, is the third kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans. These three kinds of persons, bhikkhus, arise in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Indeed, the teacher, the first great seer in the world,
his follower, a disciple who is |well-trained::awakened; lit. developed self [bhāvitatta]|;
And another, on the path, still in training,
learned and endowed with virtuous conduct.

These three, the best among gods and humans,
illuminators, expounding the Dhamma;
They open the door to the |deathless::deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amata]|,
releasing many people from their bonds.

Who, guided by the unsurpassed teacher,
follow the well-taught path;
Here itself, they make an end to |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,
those |diligent::doing one’s work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]| in the Blessed One’s teaching.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
