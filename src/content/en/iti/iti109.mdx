This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Suppose a person was being carried down by a river current that appears lovely and alluring. And a man with |clear eyes::vision [cakkhumant]|, standing on the bank, seeing him, might call out: ‘Good man, even though you’re being carried down by the river current that appears lovely and alluring, further down there is a deep pool with waves, containing whirlpools, and lurking with fierce beasts and monsters. Reaching that pool, good man, you will meet with death or deadly suffering.’ Then, bhikkhus, that person, having heard the voice of that man with clear eyes, would strive against the current with hands and feet.

This simile, bhikkhus, has been made by me for the purpose of conveying a meaning. And this is the meaning here:

‘The river current,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|.

‘The lovely and alluring appearance,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the |six internal sense bases::six inner sense spheres, the sense faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) [cha + ajjhattika + āyatana]|.

‘The deep pool below,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five lower fetters.

‘The waves,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for |anger and irritation::rage and being upset [kodhupāyāsa]|.

‘The whirlpools,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five |objects of sensual pleasure::sensual stimulation [kāmaguṇa]|.

‘Fierce beasts and monsters,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for woman.

‘Upstream,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the |renunciation::going out state, rejection of sensual pleasure [nekkhamma]|.

‘Striving against the current with hands and feet,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the rousing of energy.

‘The man with clear eyes,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the perfectly Awakened One.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Even if it’s painful, one should abandon sensual pleasures,
|aspiring for::wishing for [patthayāna]| sanctuary [from cyclical existence];
|Clearly comprehending::fully understanding [sammappajāna]| with a mind well-liberated,
may he touch |liberation::release, deliverance, freedom, emancipation [vimutti]| again and again;
He, |with perfect knowledge::who has complete understanding [vedagū]|, who has fulfilled the spiritual life,
is called one who has reached the world’s end, who has crossed beyond.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
