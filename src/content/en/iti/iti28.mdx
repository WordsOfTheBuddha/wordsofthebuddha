This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with two qualities lives in discontentment in this very life, with distress, with trouble, with burning [passion]; and upon the breaking up of the body, after death, a bad destination is expected. What two? |Lack of guarding of the sense doors::uncontrolled in senses, not having self-restraint [aguttadvāratā]|, and |lack of moderation::not knowing the limit [amattaññū]| in eating. Endowed with these two qualities, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in discontentment in this very life, with distress, with trouble, with burning [passion]; and upon the breaking up of the body, after death, a bad destination is expected."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"The eye, the ear, and the nose,
the tongue, the body, and likewise the mind;
For a bhikkhu who has these doors,
uncontrolled here —

Lacking moderation in eating,
unrestrained in the senses;
He perceives bodily and mental anguish,
and he experiences discontentment.

With a body that is burning,
with a mind that is burning;
Whether by day or by night,
such a one dwells in discontentedness."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
