This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, abandon one quality; I am your |guarantor::assurer, security [pāṭibhoga]| for |non-returning::third stage of awakening where the lower five fetters of 1) personal existence: view that one is an embodied being, 2) doubt, perplexity, or indecisiveness, 3) adherence to rules and observances, 4) sensual desire, and 5) ill will are completely overcome [anāgāmitā]|. What one quality? Bhikkhus, abandon |greed::a grasping mental quality of craving, possessiveness, or lustful wanting that clings to objects or experiences; it fuels attachment and obstructs renunciation and contentment [lobha]|; I am your guarantor for non-returning.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Overcome by greed, through which,
beings go to an unfortunate destination;
|Fully understanding::completely comprehending [sammadaññā]| that greed,
those seeing clearly abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not return,
to this world at any time.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
