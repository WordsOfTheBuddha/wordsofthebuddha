Thus was it said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, for a trainee bhikkhu whose mind has not yet attained the unsurpassed security from bondage, who is dwelling and aspiring for it, I do not see any other single factor as so helpful as |wise attention::proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yoniso + manasikāra]|. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attending wisely abandons the unwholesome and |develops::cultivates [bhāveti]| the wholesome.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Wise attention—
a quality of the trainee bhikkhu—
no other factor brings so much benefit,
for attaining the highest goal.
The bhikkhu who strives |thoroughly::properly, intelligently [yoniso]|,
reaches the end of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
