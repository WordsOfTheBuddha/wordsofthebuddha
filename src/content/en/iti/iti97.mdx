This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, in this |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| and |Vinaya::code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]|, a bhikkhu who is of |virtuous conduct::ethical, lit. of good conduct [kalyāṇasīla]|, endowed with noble qualities, and possessed of excellent wisdom is called a perfected one, one who has fulfilled one’s training, the best of men.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu one of virtuous conduct? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is ethical, lives restrained by the restraint of the |moral code of conduct::monastic code of discipline which promotes harmonious and pure conduct with others [pātimokkha]|, who knows how to behave and keep to suitable places, who sees danger even in the slightest fault, and undertakes the training by practicing the training rules. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one of virtuous conduct.

And how is he noble in qualities? Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu dwells devoted to the cultivation of the |seven sets of qualities::the seven distinct groups of principles that support the realization of awakening, includes the four establishments of mindfulness, four right efforts, four bases of spiritual power, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of awakening, and the noble eightfold path [sattannaṁ bodhipakkhiya dhammā]| that lead to awakening. This is how a bhikkhu is noble in qualities.

And how is he possessed of excellent wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, with the |wearing away::exhaustion, depletion, gradual destruction [khaya]| of the |mental defilements::mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]|, the bhikkhu dwells having personally realized the taintless |liberation of mind::emancipated by mind/heart, samādhi obtained from fruition [cetovimutti]| and the |liberation by wisdom::emancipation by insight [paññāvimutti]|, and having attained it, abides in it. This is how a bhikkhu is possessed of excellent wisdom.

This is how a bhikkhu is of virtuous conduct, endowed with noble qualities, and possessed of excellent wisdom, who is called a perfected one, one who has fulfilled one’s training, the best of men in this Dhamma and Vinaya.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“One whose actions by body, speech,
and mind are free from any wrongdoing;
That one, they say, is of virtuous conduct,
a bhikkhu endowed with |conscience::internal sense of right and wrong used for guiding one’s behavior, moral shame, scruple [hirī]|.

In whom the seven sets of qualities,
leading to awakening are well cultivated;
That one, they say, is noble in qualities,
a bhikkhu who is |not arrogant::humble [anussada]|.

One who clearly |discerns::distinguishes, understands, knows clearly [pajānāti]|,
the ending of suffering in the here and now;
That one, they say is possessed of excellent wisdom,
a bhikkhu who is free from the mental defilements.

Endowed with these qualities,
|untroubled::undisturbed, calm, free from affliction [anīgha]| and free from doubt;
Not bound by anything in the world,
They call him one who has abandoned all.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
