This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single barrier, obstructed by which, beings have wandered on and undergone |repeated existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]| for a long time, like this barrier of |ignorance::fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]|. Indeed, bhikkhus, it is because beings are obstructed by the barrier of ignorance that they have wandered on and undergone repeated existence for a long time.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“There is no other single thing,
surrounded by which, beings,
wander on day and night,
as when surrounded by |delusion::illusion, misperception, erroneous belief, false idea, misapprehension; a fundamental distortion of reality that sustains confusion, clouds discernment, and fuels further doubt [moha]|.

But those who have put an end to delusion,
and have shattered the mountain of ignorance;
They do not undergo repeated existence,
for the cause no longer exists for them.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
