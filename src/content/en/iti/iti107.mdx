This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, the |brahmins::priests, men of the Brahmin caste [brāhmaṇa]| and householders who support you with robes, alms food, lodgings, and medicinal requisites are very helpful to you. You too, bhikkhus, are very helpful to the brahmins and householders, in that you teach them the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|—beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end—meaningful and well-expressed, that proclaims the perfectly complete and purified |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures [brahmacariya]|. In this way, bhikkhus, this spiritual life is lived in mutual dependence, for the sake of crossing over the flood, for the sake of the complete ending of |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Householders and those gone forth,
relying on each other;
Accomplish the true Dhamma,
the unsurpassed security from bondage.

Householders provide robes,
requisites, and a place to dwell;
The monastics receive these gifts,
to dispel danger and distress.

Relying on the Accomplished One,
lay persons, seeking household life;
Place faith in the |Arahants::fully awakened ones, free from all mental defilements; worthy of offerings and veneration; also an epithet of the Buddha [arahant]|,
|meditators::yogis [jhāyi]| possessing noble wisdom.

Having practiced the Dhamma here,
the path that leads to a good destination;
They delight [after death] in a heavenly world,
pleased, enjoying sensual pleasures.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
