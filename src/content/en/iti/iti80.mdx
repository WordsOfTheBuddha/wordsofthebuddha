This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these three |unwholesome thoughts::unskillful thoughts, unbeneficial thinking, karmically unprofitable thoughts [akusalavitakka]|. Which three? 1) A thought |concerning one's reputation::about one's social standing [anavaññattipaṭisaṃyutta]|, 2) a thought |concerning with acquisitions, respect, and popularity::about material gains or possessions, honor or reverence, and fame or praise [lābhasakkārasilokapaṭisaṃyutta]|, and 3) a thought associated |with [inappropriate] concern for others::with excessive compassion for others [parānuddayatāpaṭisaṃyutta]|. These, indeed, are three unwholesome thoughts."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

Concerned with one's reputation,
|valuing acquisitions and respect::respecting material gains or profit and honor or reverence [lābhasakkāragārava]|;
Rejoicing together with |associates::colleagues, friends, co-workers [amacca]|,
Such a one is far away from the |exhaustion of the fetters::wearing away of the bonds that bind one to the cycle of existence [saṃyojanakkhaya]|.

Having left behind |children and cattle::sons and livestock [puttapasu]|,
marriage and |acquisitions::possessions [saṃhara]|;
Such a bhikkhu is capable of,
attaining the |highest awakening::supreme enlightenment [sambodhimuttama]|.

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
