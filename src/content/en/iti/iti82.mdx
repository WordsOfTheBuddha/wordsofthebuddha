This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are three divine sounds that arise among the gods, based on specific occasions. Which three? Whenever, bhikkhus, a disciple of the Noble Ones, having shaved off hair and beard, and having donned ochre robes, resolves to go forth from the household life into homelessness, at that moment, a divine sound arises among the gods: ‘This disciple of the Noble Ones is preparing for battle with |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]|.’ This, bhikkhus, is the first divine sound that arises among the gods at such occasions.

Again, bhikkhus, whenever at the time a disciple of the Noble Ones dwells devoted to the cultivation of the seven factors of awakening, at that time a divine sound arises among the gods: ‘This disciple of the Noble Ones is fighting with Māra!’ This, bhikkhus, is the second divine sound that arises among the gods on such occasions.

Again, bhikkhus, whenever at the time a noble disciple, through the wearing away of the |mental defilements::mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]|, dwells having attained the taintless |liberation of mind::mental liberation, emancipation of heart, a meditation attainment [cetovimutti]| and |liberation by wisdom::emancipation by insight [paññāvimutti]|, realizing it for himself with |direct knowledge::experiential understanding [abhiññāya]| here and now, at that time a divine sound arises among the gods: ‘This noble disciple, victorious in battle, having conquered the very forefront of the battlefield, now dwells at ease.’ This, bhikkhus, is the third divine sound that arises among the gods on such occasions. These, bhikkhus, are the three divine sounds that arise among the gods at specific times.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having seen the one victorious in battle,
the disciple of the perfectly Awakened One;
even the deities pay homage,
to the great, |self-assured::confident; lit. without inexperience [vītasārada]| one.

Homage to you, O thoroughbred among men!
You who have overcome the hard-to-overcome;
Having conquered the army of Death,
You are unbound through liberation.’

Thus indeed the deities pay homage,
To one |whose mind has reached the goal::who attained one’s intention, (comm) who reached arahantship [pattamānasa]|;
For they do not see that in him,
By which he might come under Death’s control.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
