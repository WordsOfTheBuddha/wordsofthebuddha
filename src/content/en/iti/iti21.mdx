This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Here, bhikkhus, I discern with the mind, after examining a certain person with a |settled mind::mentally full of confidence, a bright, pure, or pleased mind [pasannacitta]| as follows: 'If this person were to die at this very moment, they would be reborn in heaven, just as if they were carried and |placed::dropped, set aside [nikkhitta]| there.' What is the reason for this? Because, bhikkhus, their mind is settled. Due to mental clarity, bhikkhus, some beings, with the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a |good destination::fortunate condition [sugati]|, in a heavenly world.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Having known a certain person here,
to have a settled mind;
The Buddha explained this matter,
in the presence of the bhikkhus —

If this person were to die,
at this very moment;
They would be reborn in heaven,
for their mind is settled.

Just as one might carry something and |set it down::puts down, places it down [nikkhipati]|,
so too is such a person [placed in heaven];
Indeed, due to mental clarity,
beings go to a good destination.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
