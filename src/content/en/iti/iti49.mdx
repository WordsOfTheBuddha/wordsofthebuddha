This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, overcome by two kinds of wrong views, gods and humans—|some get stuck::lag behind, get bogged down [olīyati]|, while others |overreach::overshoot the mark, go too far [atidhāvati]|. But those with |clear eyes::vision [cakkhumant]| see.

And how, bhikkhus, do some get stuck? Because of taking pleasure in |[continued] existence::being, becoming [bhava]|, delighting in existing, and enjoying existence, when the Dhamma is being taught for the |ending of continued existence::ending of becoming [bhavanirodha]|, the minds of some gods and humans are not |inspired::leap forth [pakkhandati]|, they do not |gain confidence:: become clear [pasīdati]|, do not |settle down::remain still [santiṭṭhati]| and do not become resolved. In this way, bhikkhus, some lag behind.

And how, bhikkhus, do some overreach? Some, distressed by existence, ashamed of it, and being disgusted by it, delight in |annihilation::nonexistence, extermination [vibhava]|, thinking: 'Since this self, after the breakup of the body, after death, is annihilated, perishes, and does not exist after death—this is peaceful, this is excellent, this is the truth.' In this way, bhikkhus, some overreach.

And how, bhikkhus, do those with vision see? Here, a bhikkhu sees |continued conditional existence::what has come to be [bhūta]| as it actually is. Having seen continued conditional existence as it actually is, he is practicing for |disenchantment::de-illusionment, disinterest, dispassion [nibbidā]|, |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|, and |gradual ending::cessation, termination [nirodha]|."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Having seen continued conditional existence as it actually is,
those who transcend continued conditional existence;
They are freed in accordance with |actuality::reality, suchness [yathābhūta]|,
with the |complete exhaustion::gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]| of |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|.

That one, completely comprehending continued conditional existence,
is free from craving for |any state of existence::continued existence [bhavābhave]|;
With the ending of continued conditional existence,
does not arrive at any future becoming."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
