This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“There are three kinds of sagacity, bhikkhus. Which three? Physical sagacity, verbal sagacity, and mental sagacity. These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of sagacity.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Physical sagacity, verbal sagacity,
and the |taint-less::undefiled, free from effluents [anāsava]| sagacity of the mind;
A |sage::seer, hermit, monk [munī]| accomplished in sagacity,
is said to have cleansed off all |injurious [actions]::harmful, bad, potentially evil intentions or actions [pāpa]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
