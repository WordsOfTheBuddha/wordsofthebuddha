This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, a |wise person::someone who is astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]| |aspiring::wishing, desiring [patthayamāna]| for the three kinds of |happiness::ease, comfort, pleasure, contentment [sukha]| should safeguard their |virtue::moral conduct, ethical behavior [sīla]|. What three? 1) ‘May |praise::approval, acclaim, admiration [pasaṁsa]| come to me’—for this, a wise person should safeguard their virtue. 2) ‘May |wealth::possessions, property, riches [bhoga]| arise for me’—for this, a wise person should safeguard their virtue. 3) ‘Upon the breaking up of the body, after death, may I be reborn in a good destination, a |heavenly world::a blissful realm, celestial world [sagga]|'—for this, a wise person should safeguard their virtue. These are the three kinds of happiness for which a wise person should safeguard their virtue.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“A wise one should guard their virtue,
aspiring for the three kinds of happiness;
Praise, gain of wealth,
and after death, happiness in heaven.

Even if one does no |injurious actions::harmful, bad, potentially evil intention or action [pāpa]| oneself,
if one associates with another who does;
One is still suspected of injurious actions,
and one’s |bad reputation::dispraise, blame, discredit [avaṇṇa]| grows.

Whatever kind of friend one makes,
whatever kind one associates with;
So one becomes likewise,
for associating together molds one’s nature.

When associating, people affect each other,
one influences the other, while being |influenced::touched [samphuṭṭho]| too;
Like a smeared arrow, when held in a quiver,
contaminates the uncontaminated;
So too, fearing contamination, the |steadfast one::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]|,
should not befriend the wicked.

When a person wraps up,
rotten fish in |kusa grass::In ancient India, kusa grass was revered in Vedic and Buddhist rituals. It is often used in meditation seats, sacred ceremonies, and symbolic contexts. [kusa]|;
The blades of grass themselves come to smell rotten,
such is association with fools.

When a person wraps up,
|tagara::a fragrant wood or powder [tagara]| in a leaf;
The leaves themselves come to smell fragrant,
such is association with the wise.

Therefore, just as the leaf-wrap [smell],
having known the consequences of actions for oneself;
A wise person should not associate with the unvirtuous,
and should associate with the virtuous;
The unvirtuous lead to |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|,
the virtuous lead to a good rebirth.

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
