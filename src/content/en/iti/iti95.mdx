This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three |rebirths in the sensual realm::kinds of occurrences of sensual pleasures [kāmūpapatti]|. Which three? 1) Those who enjoy pleasures that have presented themselves, 2) those who delight in their own creations, and 3) those who wield power over the creations of others—these, bhikkhus, are the three rebirths in the sensual realm.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“Those who enjoy pleasures that have presented themselves,
and the gods who wield power over others' creations;
Deities who delight in their own creations,
and others indulging in sensual pleasures;
In this existence or in another form of being,
they do not go beyond |cyclic existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]|.

Having understood this |drawback::disadvantage, unsatisfactoriness, inadequacy, danger [ādīnava]|,
in |sensual gratification::enjoyment of sensual pleasures, hedonistic pleasure [kāmabhoga]|, the |wise one::astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]|—
lets go all sensual pleasures,
whether divine or human.

Formerly |bound to the pleasure of beloved forms::ensnared by delight in the attractive [piyarūpasātagadhita]|,
and later |having forded::having cut across, having breasted [chetvā]| the current hard to cross;
Without remainder, they |die their final death::attain final Nibbāna, is completely quenched [parinibbāti]|,
having fully transcended |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.

Seers of the noble truths, accomplished in wisdom,
the wise who possess perfect knowledge;
Having directly known the |wearing away of rebirth::extinction of rebirth [jātikkhaya]|,
they no longer return to renewed |existence::continued conditional existence, the karmically conditioned mode of being that leads to future rebirth [bhava]|.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
