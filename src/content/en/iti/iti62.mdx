This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

“Bhikkhus, there are these three mental faculties. What are the three? 1) The faculty that senses ‘I will know the unknown,’ 2) |the faculty of awakening::the power of final knowledge [aññindriya]|, and 3) the faculty of one |who is awakened::who has final knowledge, lit. who has understood [aññātāvī]|. These, bhikkhus, are the three mental faculties.”

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

“For a |trainee::learner, one of the seven stages of a noble person before full awakening [sekha]| who is practicing,
following the direct path;
Knowledge of the |wearing away::exhaustion, depletion, gradual destruction [khaya]| arises first,
followed next by awakening.

For one liberated through final knowledge,
there arises insight in the stable one;
'My liberation is |unshakeable::unassailable, indisputable [akuppa]|,'
|wearing away the chain of existence::exhausting the bond of further becoming [bhavasaṁyojanakkhaya]|.

One mentally accomplished,
|tranquil::peaceful, calm [santa]|, devoted to the state of peace;
They bear their final body,
having conquered |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| along with his army.”

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
