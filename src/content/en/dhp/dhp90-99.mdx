### 90

One who has completed the journey is free of sorrow,
fully liberated in all respects;
He who has eliminated all fetters,
[in him] no |affliction::mental torment, distress, strong desire, discomfort [Pariḷāha]| can be found.

### 91

The mindful ones |depart::set out, go away, leave home [uyyuñjanti]|,
they do not delight in a home;
Like a swan having left a pond behind,
they give up home after home.

### 92

For whom there is no accumulation,
who have completely comprehended nourishment [wrt existence];
Whose \|field of activity::grazing ground, domain [gocara]| is liberation,
which is \|uninhabited::without essence, abiding of emptiness [suññato]| and \|free of mental images::signless, featureless [animitto]|;
Like birds in the sky,
their trajectory is hard to trace.

### 93

Whose |defilements::outflows, discharges, taints [āsavā]| are completely exhausted,
who is not dependent on |nourishment::sustenance, food [āhāra]|;
Whose \|field of activity::grazing ground, domain [gocara]| is liberation,
which is \|uninhabited::without essence, abiding of emptiness [suññato]| and \|free of mental images::signless, featureless [animitto]|;
Like birds in the sky,
their steps are hard to trace.

### 94

Whose senses have become tranquil,
like horses well-tamed by a charioteer;
Giving up conceit and free from defilements,
even the gods hold dear such a person.

### 95

One who does not get disturbed, just like a solid rock,
such a virtuous person, immovable as a \|city post::a strong pillar [indakhīla]|;
Like a lake cleansed of mud,
such a person does not pass from one state of existence to another.

### 96

His mind is peaceful,
and peaceful are his speech and actions;
Of one fully liberated by perfect understanding,
of the tranquil and unshakable one.

### 97

Who is not gullible and who knows the |unborn::uncreated [akataññū]|,
and who has severed connection [to continued existence];
One with no more opportunities, who has vomited up desires,
Such a one is indeed the best of persons.

### 98

Whether in a village or in the forest,
whether in a valley or on a hill;
Wherever the awakened ones dwell,
that place is pleasing.

### 99

Delightful are the forests,
where no people delight;
\|Those free from passion::free from desires, without lust [vītarāgā]| will delight there,
not those who seeking sensual pleasures.
