#### 90

One who has completed the journey is free of sorrow,
fully liberated in all respects;
He has removed all knots,
[in him] no |fever::mental torment, distress, strong desire, discomfort [pariḷāha]| can be found.

#### 91

The |mindful::attentive, fully present [satīmant]| ones |depart::set out, go away, leave home [uyyuñjanti]|,
they do not delight in a home;
Like a swan having left a pond behind,
they give up home after home.

#### 92

For whom there is no |accumulation::hoarding, stockpiling [sannicaya]|,
who has completely comprehended |nutriment::nourishment, food, fuel [bhojana]| [of existence];
Whose |field of activity::grazing ground, domain [gocara]| is liberation,
which is |uninhabited::without essence, abiding of emptiness [suññato]| and |free of mental images::signless, featureless [animitto]|;
Like birds in the sky,
their |trajectory::going, passing on, path, course, destination [gati]| is hard to trace.

#### 93

Whose |defilements::outflows, discharges, taints [āsavā]| are completely exhausted,
who is not dependent on |nourishment::sustenance, food [āhāra]|;
Whose |field of activity::grazing ground, domain [gocara]| is liberation,
which is |uninhabited::without essence, abiding of emptiness [suññato]| and |free of mental images::signless, featureless [animitto]|;
Like birds in the sky,
their steps are hard to trace.

#### 94

Whose senses have become tranquil,
like horses |well-tamed::well trained, well controlled [sudanta]| by a charioteer;
Giving up |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]| and free from defilements,
even the gods hold dear such a person.

#### 95

One who does not get disturbed, just like a solid rock,
such a virtuous person, immovable as a |city post::a strong pillar [indakhīla]|;
Like a lake cleansed of mud,
such a one does not undergo |cyclic existence::wandering on from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]|.

#### 96

His mind is peaceful,
and peaceful are his speech and actions;
Of one fully liberated by perfect understanding,
of the tranquil and unshakeable one.

#### 97

Who is beyond mere faith, who knows the |unborn::uncreated [akataññū]|,
and who has severed connection [to cycle of existence];
Destroyed the possibility, |given up all wants::given up hope, vomited one’s food [vantāsa]|,
Such a one is indeed the best of persons.

#### 98

Whether in a village or in the forest,
whether on |lowlands::valley [ninna]| or on |highlands::high ground, plateau [thala]|;
Wherever the awakened ones dwell,
that place is pleasing.

#### 99

Delightful are the forests,
where no people delight;
|Those free from passion::free from desires, without lust [vītarāgā]| will delight there,
not those who seeking sensual pleasures.
