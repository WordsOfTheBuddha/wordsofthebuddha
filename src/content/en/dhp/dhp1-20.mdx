#### 1

Mind precedes all |things::phenomena, mental qualities [dhammā]|,
Mind is their chief, they are mentally produced;
If with a |corrupted::often angry, upset, or offended [paduṭṭha]| mind,
one speaks or acts;
|Suffering::discontentment, discomfort, stress [dukkhamanveti]| follows them,
like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.

#### 2

Mind precedes all things,
mind is their chief; they are mentally produced;
If with a |pure::bright, clear [pasanna]| mind,
one speaks or acts;
|Happiness::contentment, ease [sukhamanveti]| follows them,
like a never-departing shadow.

#### 3

He insulted me, he hurt me,
he defeated me, he robbed me.
Those who hold onto resentment
do not still their hatred.

#### 4

He insulted me, he hurt me,
he defeated me, he robbed me;
Those who let go of resentment,
still their hatred.

#### 5

|Hostility::hatred, ill will, animosity, enmity [vera]| is never |settled::calmed, appeased [sammati]| by hostility,
in this world at any time;
Only by non-hostility is hostility settled,
this is an eternal principle.

#### 6

Others do not realize,
that we all must die;
But those who do realize this,
their |conflicts::arguments, disputes, differences [medhaga]| are settled.

#### 7

Living perceiving the |attractive::beautiful [subha]|,
unrestrained in the senses;
Not knowing moderation in eating,
|lazy::procrastinating, inactive person, indolent [kusīta]| and |weak in effort::low in energy, lacking in endurance [hīnavīriya]|;
|Māra::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]| overpowers that one,
like the wind overpowers a weak tree.

#### 8

Living |perceiving the unattractive::seeing the disagreeable, considering the drawbacks to beautiful [asubhānupassī]|,
well-restrained in the senses;
Knowing moderation in eating,
with |faith::confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]| and |with energy aroused::with initiative [āraddhavīriya]|;
Māra does not overpower that one,
like the wind does not overpower a mountain rock.

#### 9

If one is impure,
and wears the bhikkhu's |ochre::organic brown, color of a bhikhu's robe [kāsāva]| robe;
Lacking self-restraint and honesty,
they are not worthy of the robe.

#### 10

One who has discarded impurity,
|who is virtuous::has regard for ethical conduct| and |collected::well-composed, completely calm, totally settled, attentive [susamāhita]| [in mind];
Endowed with self-restraint and honesty,
is indeed worthy of the robe.

#### 11

Those who perceive essence in the |essenceless::without essence, without substance [asāra]|,
and see the |essential::fundamental, substantial [sāra]| as having no essence;
They do not attain the essential,
being in the domain of |wrong intentions::with wrong notions, wrong ideas [micchāsaṅkappā]|.

#### 12

And those who know the essential as essential,
and the essenceless as essenceless;
They attain the essence,
being in the domain of |right intentions::with correct intentions, having right volitions, with correct notions [sammāsaṅkappā]|.

#### 13

Just as a poorly covered house,
is penetrated by rain;
So is an |undeveloped::not cultivated [abhāvita]| mind,
penetrated by |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|.

#### 14

Just as a well-covered house,
is not penetrated by rain;
So is a |fully developed::well cultivated [subhāvita]| mind,
not penetrated by passion.

#### 15

Here he |sorrows::grieves [socati]|, after death he sorrows,
the evil-doer sorrows in both cases;
He sorrows, he is |troubled::afflicted, worried [vihaññati]|,
having seen the impurity of his own actions.

#### 16

Here he is |pleased::glad [modati]|, after death he is pleased,
the doer of good deeds is pleased in both cases;
He is pleased, he is |delighted::very happy, joyful [pamodati]|,
having seen the purity of his own actions.

#### 17

Here he |regrets::suffers remorse, burns [tappati]|, after death he regrets,
the evildoer regrets in both cases;
Regrets with the thought "Evil has been done by me",
and regrets even more after reaching a |bad destination::state of misery [duggati]|.

#### 18

Here he is |happy::delighted [nandati]|, after death he is happy,
the doer of good is happy in both cases;
He is happy with the thought, "Merit has been done by me",
and he is happy even more after reaching a blissful state.

#### 19

Even if a person speaks many eloquent words,
if they do not act accordingly, being |negligent::inattentive, careless, intoxicated [pamatta]|;
Like a cowherd counting others' cows,
they do not partake in the true ascetic life.

#### 20

Even if a person speaks few eloquent words,
If they act according to the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|;
Abandoning passion, |aversion::ill will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]|, and |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misapprehension, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|,
|Clearly comprehending::fully understanding [sammappajāna]| with a well-liberated mind,
|Not clinging to::not taking as mine, not grasping onto, not taking possession of [anupādiyāna]| here or there,
They partake in the true ascetic life.
