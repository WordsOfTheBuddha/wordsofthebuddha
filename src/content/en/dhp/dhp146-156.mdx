title: Jarā vagga - Chapter 11 - Old Age
description: Dhammapada verses 146–156 explore impermanence, the nature of the body, and the inevitability of aging and death. Through metaphors of a world ablaze, a decaying body, the house-builder and a city of bones, they point to life’s transience and the futility of clinging to sensual pleasures. The verses highlight the cultivation of wisdom, detachment, and the pursuit of an unconditioned state beyond constructs, contrasting fleeting youth and inevitable old age with the timeless teachings that lead to liberation.

#### 146

What is the laughter, what is the joy,
when the world is |perpetually ablaze::burning with desire, aversion, and delusion [niccaṁ + pajjalite]|;
Enveloped by |darkness::blindness, ignorance of how things have come to be [andhakāra]|,
why do you not seek the |light::lamp, cultivate wisdom of how things have come to be, ultimate reality [padīpa]|?

#### 147

Behold this form, a mind-made |adornment::image [bimba]|,
propped up in a body full of sores;
Afflicted, |full of plans::with many intentions, the object of many considerations [bahusaṅkappa]|,
of which, there is nothing |enduring::continuous, regular [dhuva]| or |stable::constant, persistent [ṭhiti]|.

#### 148

This body is |worn out::become old, decayed [parijiṇṇa]|,
a nest of disease, |fragile::perishable [pabhaṅgura]|;
This |putrid accumulation::decaying mass [pūtisandeha]| breaks apart,
for life surely ends in death.

#### 149

Like discarded |bottle gourds::long melon, calabash [alābu]|,
in the |autumn season::season after the rains, when the leaves fall [sārada]|;
Are these greyish bones,
seeing them, what is the delight?

#### 150

This body is a city built of bones,
plastered with flesh and blood;
Within it dwell old age and death,
along with |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]| and |contempt::ungratefulness, depreciation, denigration, disrespect, belittlement, disparagement [makkha]|.

#### 151

The beautifully designed royal chariots wear out,
and the body too experiences old age;
But the |teaching of the sages::the teaching of the Buddhas that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sataṃ + dhamma]| does not age,
the wise |make it known::pass it on, proclaim [pavedayati]| to the virtuous persons.

#### 152

A person of |little learning::having ignorance of how things have come to be, not knowing the nature of reality [appassuta]|,
grows old just like an ox;
They grow in mass,
but their wisdom does not grow.

#### 153

Through countless births in |cyclic existence::wandering on, moving on continuously, passing from one state of existence to another, stream of existence [saṃsāra]|,
I have wandered without finding [a way out];
Seeking the |house-builder [of this body]::creator of the body, the one who constructs the body, a metaphor for craving [gahakāra]|,
experiencing the suffering of birth again and again.

#### 154

I have seen you, house-builder,
you will not build a house again;
All your |rafters::beams [phāsukā]| are dismantled,
your |ridgepole::top beam, metaphor for ignorance [gahakūṭa]| is |dismantled::deconstructed [visaṅkhata]|;
The mind has |gone beyond all conditions::become unconditioned, unfabricated, unconstructed [visaṅkhāragata]|,
having |exhausted::wore away, slowly destroyed [khayamajjhagā]| |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]|.

#### 155

Not having lived the |spiritual life::a life of celibacy, contemplation, and ethical discipline lived for the sake of liberation; oriented toward inner development rather than sensual pleasures  [brahmacariya]|,
and not having obtained wealth in youth;
They |brood::obsess, think moodily [jhāyati]| like |old herons::old cranes [jiṇṇakoñca]|,
in a pond depleted of fish.

#### 156

Not having fulfilled the spiritual life,
and not having obtained wealth in youth;
They sit, |spent and exhausted::worn out [cāpātikhīṇa]|,
|lamenting over::moaning about, sighing about [anutthunanta]| the |past::old times [purāṇa]|.
