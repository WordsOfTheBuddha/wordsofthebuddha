#### 33

The mind is |trembling::quivering, in agitation [phandana]|, |unsteady::wavering, fickle, inconsistent [capala]|,
difficult to guard and hard to hold back;
The wise one makes it |exact::upright [uju]|,
like a |fletcher::arrow-maker [usukāra]| sharpens an arrow.

#### 34

Like a fish tossed on dry land,
when pulled out from its home in water;
The mind shakes and trembles,
struggling to escape |Māra's realm::death's domain [māradheyya]|.

#### 35

Tricky to pin down and swift,
landing wherever it likes;
The |taming::mastery, self-control [damatha]| of the mind is good,
for a tamed mind brings happiness.

#### 36

The mind is subtle, very difficult to see,
landing wherever it likes;
The |wise one::who has good judgement [medhāvī]| should protect the mind,
for a protected mind brings happiness.

#### 37

Wandering far and moving on its own,
|intangible::incorporeal [asarīra]|, with its abode concealed;
Those who restrain the mind,
will be freed from the |shackles of death::Māra's bonds [mārabandhana]|.

#### 38

For one whose mind is |unstable::ungrounded, not dependable, unreliable [anavaṭṭhita]|,
and who does not understand the true |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|;
For one |whose confidence wavers::whose faith fluctuates [pariplavapasāda]|,
wisdom does not reach fullness.

#### 39

For one whose mind is |not oozing [with lust]::unmoved, not corrupted [anavassuta]|,
and whose thoughts are not afflicted;
For one who has transcended merit and demerit,
there is no fear for the |awake::alert, lucid [jāgara]|.

#### 40

Having known this body as [fragile] like a clay pot,
and set up this mind like a well-fortified city;
One should fight |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| with the sword of wisdom,
then guarding victory, remain without attachment.

#### 41

Before long, this body,
will lie upon earth;
Discarded, |devoid of consciousness::insensate [apetaviññāṇa]|,
like a useless log.

#### 42

Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy,
or a hostile person may do to another;
A mind that is wrongly oriented,
inflicts on oneself greater harm.

#### 43

Not even one's mother or father,
or any other relatives;
Can do as much good,
as a mind that is rightly oriented.
