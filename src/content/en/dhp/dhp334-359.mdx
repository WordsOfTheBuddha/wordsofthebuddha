title: Taṇhā vagga - Chapter 24 - Craving
description: Dhammapada verses 334–359 depict craving as a binding force, likening it to a creeping vine, a trapped hare, and a spider’s web. The wise cut these bonds, free from passion, aversion, illusion, and longing, crossing beyond birth and aging. The highest gift is the Dhamma, surpassing all wealth and pleasures, and the destruction of craving is the greatest victory. Offerings to those free from defilements bear the greatest fruit.

#### 334

For a human who lives with |negligence::carelessness, heedlessness [pamāda]|,
|craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]| grows like a |māluvā::a fast-growing, parasitic vine that climbs onto trees. As it grows, it tightens its grip, restricting the host tree’s growth and often strangling it to death. [māluvā]| creeper;
He swings from this life to the next,
like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.

#### 335

Whoever is overcome by this |despicable::awful [jammi]| seeking,
this |entangling::ensnaring [vissatika]| craving in the world;
For him |sorrow::grief, sadness [soka]| grows,
like |vetiver grass::a fragrant grass known for its deep, tangled root system. It spreads aggressively when watered. [bīraṇa]| flourishing after the rain.

#### 336

But whoever overcomes this despicable seeking,
this |difficult to overcome::hard to escape [duraccaya]| craving in the world;
For him sorrow falls away,
like a drop of water from a lotus leaf.

#### 337

This I say to you, 'Good luck,
to all of you who have gathered here;'
Dig up the root of craving,
like one seeking the root of vetiver grass;
Lest |Māra::the ruler of the sensual realm, often depicted as a tempter who tries to obstruct beings from the path to liberation [māra]| break you,
again and again, like a |reed::tall, thin plants that grow in marshes or near water. They are weak and hollow inside and prone to easily bending or breaking from external forces. [naḷa]| in a stream.

#### 338

Just as, when the root remains firm and undamaged,
though the tree was cut down, it grows again;
Likewise, if the underlying tendency to craving is not rooted out,
|suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| springs up again and again.

#### 339

In whoever the |thirty-six currents [of craving]::the eighteen ways of craving pertaining to the internal bases and the eighteen ways of craving pertaining to the external bases are described in the [AN 4.199 Taṇhā sutta - Craving](/an4.199) discourse. [chattiṃsati + sotā]|,
strongly flow towards what is pleasing;
They swiftly carry away one of |wrong view::distorted perceptions, untrue views, false beliefs [micchādiṭṭhi]|,
due to his |passionate intentions::volitions, choices, decisions rooted in passion, intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāganissita]|.

#### 340

Everywhere, these currents [of craving] flow,
creepers sprout and take root;
Seeing that the creeper has sprung up,
cut off its root with |wisdom::distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]|.

#### 341

Flowing in [from all objects] and lovely,
|feelings of joy::pleasure, gladness, positive state of mind [somanassa]| arise in beings;
|Clinging to comfort::attached to pleasure [sātasita]| and seeking happiness,
these persons are headed to birth and old age.

#### 342

Beings, beset by |craving::wanting, desire, lit. thirst [tasiṇā]|,
wriggle like a trapped hare;
Bound fast by mental fetters,
they experience suffering again and again, for a long time.

#### 343

Beings, beset by craving,
wriggle like a trapped hare;
Therefore, one should |drive out::dispel, remove [vinodayati]| craving,
aspiring for the |fading of desire::dispassion, detachment [virāga]|.

#### 344

One who claims to be free from craving, |inclined to the forest::devoted to renunciation [vanādhimutta]|,
yet, though freed, rushes back to craving;
Look at that person!
Freed, yet he hurries back to his very |chains::attachment, bondage, connection, fetter [bandhana]|!

#### 345

The wise don't call that a strong bond,
that which is made of iron, wood, or hemp;
But the infatuation for jewels and ornaments,
and longing for children and wives.

#### 346

This, the |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]| ones call a strong bond,
weighing one down, loose yet hard to escape;
Having cut even this, they wander forth
unconcerned, having abandoned the |comfort of sensual pleasures::enjoyment of sense desire [kāmasukha]|.

#### 347

Those |filled with passion::infatuated with lust [rāgaratta]| are swept away by the current,
like a spider in its self-spun web;
Having cut even this, the stable ones wander forth,
unconcerned, having abandoned all suffering.

#### 348

Let go of the past, let go of the future,
let go of the present, and cross over to the father shore beyond existence;
With a mind fully liberated in every way,
you will not again undergo birth and old age.

#### 349

For a person whose mind is agitated by thoughts,
and pierced by passion, contemplating the attractive;
Craving increases even more,
this indeed is what makes the bond strong.

#### 350

But whoever delights in the |stilling of thoughts::settling the mind [vitakkūpasama]|,
and is ever mindful, contemplating the unattractive;
This one will bring an end to craving,
this one will cut Māra's bonds.

#### 351

Having reached surety, |fearless::unshaken, not alarmed, unstartled [asantāsī]|,
without craving and |blemish free::spotless [anaṅgaṇa]|;
He has cut off the barbs of existence,
this is the final body.

#### 352

Without craving, |without clinging::free from attachment, not grasping, not taking anything as one's own [anādāno]|,
skilled in words and their explanations;
Knowing how syllables are arranged,
which come before and which after;
The one in his final body is said to be,
'a profoundly wise one, a great man.'

#### 353

Victorious over everything, all I have known,
yet I remain |untainted::unstained, unsullied [anūpalitta]| by all things conquered and known;
Having abandoned all, liberated through the |complete ending of craving::gradual wearing awy of craving, depletion of desire, extinction of longing [taṇhakkhaya]|,
thus directly knowing by myself—whom should I call as my teacher?

#### 354

The gift of the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| surpasses all other gifts,
the taste of the Dhamma surpasses all flavors;
The delight in the Dhamma surpasses all delights,
the ending of craving overcomes all suffering.

#### 355

|Riches::property, possessions [bhoga]| destroy the |undiscerning one::one lacking discernment, who has not cultivated wisdom, unwise [dummedha]|,
but not the one who seeks liberation;
The undiscerning person, driven by craving for riches,
destroys not just others, but himself as well.

#### 356

Fields are spoiled by weeds,
this population is spoiled by |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|;
Therefore, in those free from desire,
a gift bears great fruit.

#### 357

Fields are spoiled by weeds,
this population is spoiled by |aversion::ill will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]|;
Therefore, in those free from aversion,
a gift bears great fruit.

#### 358

Fields are spoiled by weeds,
this population is spoiled by |illusion::delusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view; that which fuels further confusion and doubt [moha]|;
Therefore, in those free from illusion,
a gift bears great fruit.

#### 359

Fields are spoiled by weeds,
this population is spoiled by |longing::wish, desire [iccha]|;
Therefore, in those free from longing,
a gift bears great fruit.
