#### 60

Long is the night for one who is awake,
long is a |yojana::a unit of distance used in ancient India, ranging from 3.5 to 15 km [yojana]| for one who is tired;
Long is the |cyclic existence::wandering on, moving on continuously, passing from one state of existence to another, stream of existence [saṃsāra]| for the |immature::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]|,
those who do not understand the true |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|.

#### 61

If, while wandering, one does not find,
a companion who is better or equal;
One should steadfastly pursue a |solitary life::going about or living alone [ekacariyā]|,
there is no fellowship with the immature.

#### 62

“These are my children, this is my wealth,”
with such thoughts the immature person |is afflicted::is troubled by, is worried about, is distressed by, suffers anguish from [vihaññati]|;
One’s self is not even one’s own,
how then can there be sons? How then, wealth?

#### 63

The immature person who knows his |immaturity::childishness, ignorance [bālya]|,
is wise to that extent;
The immature person who believes they are wise,
is truly said to be “immature.”

#### 64

Even if for a whole lifetime, an immature person,
|associates closely with::honors, respects [payirupāsati]| a wise person;
They do not understand the Dhamma,
just as a spoon does not know the taste of soup.

#### 65

Even if for only a moment, a |discerning person::intelligent, who can distinguish [viññū]|,
associates closely with a wise person;
They swiftly understand the Dhamma,
just as the tongue knows the taste of soup.

#### 66

Immature persons who lack discernment,
act as their own enemies;
Performing harmful deeds,
which |bear bitter fruits::with painful results [kaṭuka + phala]|.

#### 67

That action is not well done,
which, having done, one |later regrets::suffers remorse from [anutappati]|;
With a tearful face, one weeps,
experiencing its result.

#### 68

And that action is well done,
which, having done, one does not regret;
One is satisfied and cheerful,
experiencing its result.

#### 69

An immature person |conceives::thinks, imagines, presumes, supposes [maññati]| it is like honey,
until the misdeed does not ripen;
but when the misdeed ripens,
then they fall into |suffering::pain, discomfort, unease, unpleasantness, trouble, stress [dukkha]|.

#### 70

Even if, month by month, an immature person,
were to eat their food |with the tip of a grass blade::a reference to undertaking an extreme austerity [kusagga]|;
Yet compared to the |one who has comprehended the nature of reality::one who has understood the Dhamma, the truth, an Arahant, awakened being [saṅkhātadhamma]|,
they are not worth a sixteenth part.

#### 71

Indeed, an |injurious action::harmful, bad, potentially evil intention or action [pāpa]|, once performed,
does not solidify quickly, like fresh milk thickening;
Smoldering, it shadows the immature person,
like fire hidden beneath ashes.

#### 72

Only for the sake of |harm::misfortune, damage, injury, hurt, detriment [anattha]|,
does knowledge arise in an immature person;
It afflicts their good fortune,
and shatters their head.

#### 73

He would desire praise for the qualities he does not possess,
and |precedence::esteem [purekkhāra]| among the bhikkhus;
Authority in dwelling places,
and |veneration::homage, honor [pūjā]| from other households.

#### 74

Let both householders and renunciants
think, “This was done by me alone,”
Let them be dependent on me,
in whatever should or should not be done;
Such is the |intention::thought, volition, conception, plan [saṅkappa]| of an immature person,
their |longings::wishes, desires [icchā]| and |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]| only grow.

#### 75

For the pursuit of |acquisitions::gain, money, profit, possessions [lābha]| is one thing,
and the path to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]| is another;
Experientially understanding this,
a bhikkhu, disciple of the Buddha;
Should not take delight in |respect::honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]|,
but should cultivate |seclusion::solitude, detachment [viveka]|.
