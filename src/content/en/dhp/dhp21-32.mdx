#### 21

Diligence (quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]) is the path to the deathless (Nibbāna [amata]),
Negligence (not having regard for diligence, carelessness, heedlessness [pamāda]) is the path to death;
The diligent do not die,
The negligent are as if dead.

#### 22

Thus, understanding this distinction,
The wise excel in diligence;
They rejoice in heedfulness,
Engaged in the domain of the noble ones.

#### 23

Those meditators who are practicing continuously,
consistently firm in effort;
The stable (firm, wise [dhīra]) ones attain liberation,
The unsurpassed (highest, incomparable [anuttara]) safety from the bonds (yoke, attachment, which binds one to the cyclical existence [yoga]).

#### 24

One who is energetic (ready for action [uṭṭhānavant]) and mindful,
pure in actions, who acts calmly;
Self-restrained and living ethically,
The fame (glory, prestige [yasa]) of such a diligent one surpasses.

#### 25

By initiative and diligence,
with self-restraint and discipline;
The \{wise one} (who has good judgement [medhāvī]) should make an island,
Which no flood can submerge.

#### 26

Immature (lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]), unwise (one lacking discernment, who has not cultivated wisdom [dummedhī]) persons,
indulge in negligence (do not have regard for diligence);
But the wise one guards diligence,
like the \{most important} (foremost, supreme [seṭṭha]) wealth.

#### 27

Do not indulge in negligence,
Do not delight or associate with sensual pleasures;
The diligent one, meditating,
experiences expansive contentment (ease, contented abiding [sukha]).

#### 28

When with diligence,
the wise one dispels negligence;
Climbing the tower of wisdom,
free from sorrow, seeing the sorrowful persons;
Like one on a mountain top sees those on the ground,
the stable one sees the immature, undiscerning persons.

#### 29

The diligent amongst the negligent,
wide awake amongst the asleep;
Like a swift horse amongst the feeble,
the wise one proceeds leaving them behind.

#### 30

Through diligence, Maghavant (Indra, the chief of the gods),
attained eminence amongst the gods;
They praise diligence,
negligence is always blamed.

#### 31

A bhikkhu who is devoted to diligence,
who sees danger in negligence;
Burns away all fetters (chains, bonds, things which binds [saṁyojanā]), both subtle (fine [aṇu]) and gross (coarse [thūla]),
like a blazing fire that consumes everything.

#### 32

A bhikkhu who is devoted to diligence,
who sees danger in negligence;
Is incapable of decline,
and is near to Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]).
