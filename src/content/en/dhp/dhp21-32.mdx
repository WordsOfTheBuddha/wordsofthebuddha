#### 21

|Diligence::quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]| is the path to the |deathless::deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amata]|,
|negligence::carelessness, heedlessness [pamāda]| is the path to death;
The diligent do not die,
The negligent are as if dead.

#### 22

Thus, understanding this clearly,
The |wise::astute, intelligent, learned, skilled [paṇḍita]| excel in diligence;
They rejoice in diligence,
|delighting in::devoted to [rata]| the domain of the |noble ones::distinguished, an ethically noble person, an awakened being [ariya]|.

#### 23

Those |meditators::yogis [jhāyi]| who are practicing continuously,
consistently firm in effort;
The |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]| ones attain |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|,
The |unsurpassed::highest, incomparable [anuttara]| safety from the |bonds::yoke, attachment, which binds one to the cyclical existence [yoga]|.

#### 24

One who is |energetic::ready for action [uṭṭhānavant]| and |mindful::attentive, fully present [satīmant]|,
pure in actions, who acts calmly;
|Self-controlled::self restrained [attadanta]| and living ethically,
The |fame::glory, prestige [yasa]| of such a diligent one surpasses.

#### 25

By initiative and diligence,
with |restraint::self-control [saṁyama]| and |discipline::taming [dama]|;
The |wise one::who has good judgement [medhāvī]| should make an island,
Which no flood can submerge.

#### 26

|Immature::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]|, |unwise::one lacking discernment, who has not cultivated wisdom [dummedhī]| persons,
indulge in negligence;
But the wise one guards diligence,
like the |most important::best, foremost [seṭṭha]| wealth.

#### 27

Do not indulge in negligence,
Do not delight or associate with sensual pleasures;
The diligent one, meditating,
experiences expansive |contentment::ease, contented abiding [sukha]|.

#### 28

With diligence,
the wise one dispels negligence;
Ascending the palace of wisdom,
free from sorrow, seeing sorrowful persons;
Like one standing on a mountain sees those on the ground,
the stable one sees the |immature persons::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāle]|.

#### 29

The diligent amongst the negligent,
wide awake amongst the asleep;
Like a swift horse amongst the feeble,
the wise one proceeds leaving them behind.

#### 30

Through diligence, |Maghavant::Indra, the chief of the gods|,
attained eminence amongst the gods;
They praise diligence,
negligence is always blamed.

#### 31

A bhikkhu who is devoted to diligence,
who sees danger in negligence;
Burns away all |fetters::chains, bonds, things which binds [saṁyojanā]|, both |subtle::fine [aṇu]| and |gross::coarse [thūla]|,
like a blazing fire that consumes everything.

#### 32

A bhikkhu who is devoted to diligence,
who sees danger in negligence;
Is incapable of decline,
and is near to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.
