### 167

One should not pursue a |base::inferior, low, deficient [hīna]| \|way of life::teachings, principles, practices [dhamma]|,
nor should one live with |negligence::carelessly, heedlessly [pamāda]|;
One should not embrace a \|wrong view::a distorted perception, an untrue view, a false belief [micchādiṭṭhi]|,
and one should not \|indulge in the world::attached to the world, fostering worldliness [lokavaḍḍhana]|.

### 168

One should rise up and not be negligent,
one should live in accordance with the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|, with good conduct;
Living in accordance with the Dhamma, one rests in |ease::contentment, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]|,
both in this world and the next.

### 169

One should live in accordance with the Dhamma, with good conduct,
and not live with \|unwholesome conduct::misbehavior, bad conduct, misconduct [duccarita]|;
Living in accordance with the Dhamma, one rests in |ease::contentment, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]|,
both in this world and the next.

### 170

As one would see a bubble,
as one would see an |illusion::a mirage, a trick of the eye [marīcika]|;
One who |regards::sees, views [avekkhanta]| the world in this way,
is not seen by the Lord of Death.

### 171

Come, see this world,
adorned like a royal chariot;
Here, the immature \|sink [in attachment]::flounder, become dejected [visīdati]|,
but \|those who understand::for those who discern [vijānataṃ]| remain unbound.

### 172

One who, having been negligent before,
is no longer negligent afterward;
|Illuminates::brightens [pabhāseti]| the world,
like the moon freed from clouds.

### 173

For one whose |injurious::harmful, bad, potentially evil [pāpa]| actions,
are |superseded::supplanted [pidhīyati]| by |wholesome::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]| actions;
That person illuminates the world,
like the moon freed from clouds.

### 174

This world is |blind::ignorant of or misunderstanding the true nature of reality [andhabhūta]|,
only a few here \|see clearly::understand with insight [vipassati]|;
Like a bird \|freed from the net::escaped from the snare [jālamutta]|,
only a few reach heaven.

### 175

|Swans::metaphorically representing sages [haṁsā]| travel the pathway of the sun,
they move through the sky with their \|psychic abilities::spiritual powers, supernormal abilities [iddhi]|;
The |wise::intelligent one, stable, steady [dhīra]| are emancipated from the world,
having conquered |Māra::embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]| and his army.

### 176

For one who has transgressed a single principle,
a person who engages in \|false speech::lying [musāvāda]|;
\|Who has disregarded the afterlife::who has rejected, given up or neglected the next world [vitiṇṇaparaloka]|,
there is no injurious action that is \|not do-able::impossible to do [akāriya]|.

### 177

Truly, the stingy do not go to the heaven,
for \|immature persons::childish persons, lacking discernment [bālā]| do not praise giving;
The wise one rejoices in giving,
just by that he finds ease |hereafter::afterwards, later [parattha]|.

### 178

Better than sole sovereignty over the earth,
better than going to heaven;
Better than \|lordship over all the worlds::rulership over the entire universe [sabbalokādhipacca]|,
is the fruit of \|entering the stream::stream-entry, first stage of enlightenment [sotāpatti]|.
