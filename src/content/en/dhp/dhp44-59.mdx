#### 44

Who will discern (understand, discriminate [vicessati]) this earth,
as well as \{the world of the dead} (Yama's world [yamaloka]) and the world of the gods;
Who will understand the \{state of awakening} (path of the Dhamma, the teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhammapada]),
like a skillful one picking flowers.

#### 45

The trainee (one of the seven stages of a noble person before awakening [sekha]) will discern this earth,
as well as the world of the dead and the world of the gods;
The trainee will understand the state of awakening,
like a skillful one picking flowers.

#### 46

Having understood this body as \{like foam} (similar to froth [pheṇūpama]),
and having realized its \{illusory nature} (insubstantial, mirage like nature [marīcidhamma]);
Having cut off \{Māra's} (embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]) flowery snares,
one goes beyond the sight of the King of Death.

#### 47

While gathering flowers,
\{with an attached mind} (with mental obsession, infatuated [byāsattamanasa]);
Like a great flood sweeps away a sleeping village,
so does death carry such a person away.

#### 48

While gathering flowers,
with an attached mind;
Still unsatisfied (discontent [atitta]) with sensual pleasures,
such a person comes under death's control.

#### 49

Just as a bee approaches a flower,
\{without harming} (not hurting, not disturbing [aheṭhayanta]) its beauty and fragrance;
And leaves having taken the nectar,
so should a sage (seer, hermit, monk [munī]) wander in the village.

#### 50

Not the faults of others,
nor what others have or have not done;
One should consider one's own actions,
deeds, both done and not done.

#### 51

Just as a beautiful flower,
full of color but \{lacking fragrance} (without scent [agandhaka]);
So too, well-spoken words,
\{bear no fruit} (are in vain, are of no use [aphala]) for one who does not act.

#### 52

Just as a beautiful flower,
full of color and fragrance;
So too, well-spoken words,
are fruitful (constructive, worthwhile [saphala]) for one who acts.

#### 53

Just as from a heap of flowers,
one could make many garlands;
So too, by one who is born and mortal,
much good (wholesomeness, beneficialness, skillfulness [kusala]) should be done.

#### 54

The fragrance of flowers does not blow against the wind,
nor does the fragrance of sandalwood, tagara, or jasmine;
But the fragrance of a \{virtuous person} (wise person, sage [santa]) rises against the wind,
the \{virtuous person's} (good person, arahant, awakened being [sappurisa]) fragrance radiates in all directions.

#### 55

Sandalwood, tagara,
lotus, and also jasmine;
Of all these kinds of fragrances,
the fragrance of virtue (ethical conduct, moral integrity [sīla]) is unsurpassed.

#### 56

Insignificant is this fragrance,
the scent of tagara and sandalwood;
But the fragrance of the virtuous person spreads far,
unsurpassed among the gods.

#### 57

Of those with perfected virtue,
who dwell with diligence (quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]);
\{Who are freed through complete comprehension} (who is liberated by perfect understanding, epithet of an Arahant [sammadaññāvimutta]),
their path is not found by Māra.

#### 58

Just as in a heap of garbage,
discarded by the roadside,
A lotus blooms,
pure in fragrance, delightful, and pleasing.

#### 59

So, among those \{who are like a heap of garbage} (concocted, put together of the five aggregates [saṅkārabhūtesu]),
blind and ignorant, ordinary people;
One illuminates with wisdom—
a disciple of the Fully Awakened One.
