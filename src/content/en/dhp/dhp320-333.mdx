#### 320

Like an elephant in battle,
who |endures::withstands, bears, tolerates [titikkhati]| an arrow shot from a bow;
So will I endure |verbal abuse::blame [ativākya]|,
for many people are |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]|.

#### 321

The |well-tamed [beast]::trained, mastered [danta]| is led to the assembly,
The tamed [elephant] is the one the king mounts;
The tamed person is the best among humans,
one who endures verbal abuse.

#### 322

Well-trained mules,
thoroughbred horses from |Sindh::A historic region (now in Pakistan) famed for its high-quality thoroughbred horses, prized for their speed and endurance.|,
majestic elephants and great tuskers,
but better than these is one who is |self-controlled::self restrained [attadanta]|.

#### 323

Not by these vehicles,
could one travel to the |untraveled destination::ultimate unreached goal, Nibbāna [agata disa]|;
But by one's own well-tamed self,
the self-controlled one reaches the goal.

#### 324

Dhanapāla, the elephant,
who is in |musth::A periodic condition in male elephants marked by heightened aggression and secretion of a pungent fluid from the temples.| and difficult to restrain;
Bound, he does not eat the morsel given to him,
but only longs for the elephant forest.

#### 325

When one is drowsy and a glutton,
a sleeper who tosses and turns in bed;
Like a great pig fattened on fodder,
the |dull-witted one::tender, weak, undeveloped [manda]| is reborn again and again.

#### 326

Previously, this mind wandered on its own,
wherever it wished, wherever it liked, and wherever it found pleasure;
Today, I shall restrain it |wisely::properly, prudently, thoroughly, carefully [yoniso]|,
like a mahout controlling an elephant in rut with a hook.

#### 327

|Delight in diligence::devote to conscientiousness, take pleasure in alertness [appamādarata]|,
|look after::guard, protect [anurakkhati]| your own mind;
Lift yourself out of this pit,
just like an elephant draws himself out of the mud.

#### 328

If one finds a |wise::discerning, astute [nipaka]| companion,
a virtuous and discerning fellow traveler;
Let one walk together, overcoming all dangers,
with a pleased mind and |mindfulness::full awareness and recollection of the body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities, observing them clearly with sustained attention, free from craving and distress [sati]|.

#### 329

If one does not find a wise companion,
a virtuous and discerning fellow traveler;
Let one walk alone, like a king leaving his conquered realm,
like an elephant roaming the |Mātaṅga::A mythical or historical forest known for being a habitat of wild elephants. Here, it symbolizes solitude and the freedom of a great tusker, a metaphor for a wise person living independently [mātaṅga]| forest.

#### 330

A solitary life is better,
there is no companionship with |immature persons::lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāle]|;
Let one walk alone, not partaking in |injurious actions::harmful, bad, potentially evil intention or action [pāpa]|,
calm and unconcerned, like an elephant in the Mātaṅga forest.

#### 331

Friends bring |ease::contentment, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]| when a need arises,
Contentment is ease in all situations;
|Merit::good deeds, spiritual wealth [puññā]| is ease at life's end,
The |giving up::letting go, abandoning, removal [pahāna]| of all |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| is the highest ease.

#### 332

In this world, good is devotion to one's mother,
and good is devotion to one's father;
In this world, good is devotion to |renunciants::ascetics, monks [samaṇa]|,
and good is devotion to the |holy men::Arahants [brahman]|.

#### 333

Good is |virtue::morality, ethical conduct [sīla]| lasting until old age,
good is faith that is |well established::firmly grounded [patiṭṭhita]|;
Good is the acquisition of wisdom,
and good is the non-doing of |injurious actions::harmful, bad, potentially evil intention or actions [pāpā]|.
