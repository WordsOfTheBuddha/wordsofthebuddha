### 209

One who engages in what is \{not suitable} (to be avoided [ayoga]),
and neglects what is suitable;
Clinging to what is pleasing, having given up their true welfare (good, benefit, profit [attha]),
envies those \{devoted to diligent effort} (practicing for development, with carefulness, care and alertness [attānuyogī]).

### 210

Do not associate with what is pleasing,
nor with what is displeasing;
For separation from the beloved is suffering,
and so too is the sight of the unloved (disagreeable [appiya]).

### 211

Therefore, do not hold anything as beloved,
for separation from the beloved is painful;
There are no bonds (ties, knots [gantha]) for those,
for whom there is neither \{the beloved nor the unloved} (pleasant and unpleasant [piyāppiya]).

### 212

From beloved arises sorrow (grief, sadness [soka]),
from beloved arises fear (dread, terror [bhaya]);
For one who is freed from the beloved,
there is no sorrow—whence fear?

### 213

From fondness (affection, dearness [pema]) arises sorrow,
from fondness arises fear;
For one who is freed from fondness,
there is no sorrow—whence fear?

### 214

From delight (relish, liking, pleasure [rati]) arises sorrow,
from delight arises fear;
For one who is freed from delight,
there is no sorrow—whence fear?

### 215

From \{sensual pleasures} (sense desires, wishing, wanting, delighting in [kāma]) arises sorrow,
from sensual pleasures arises fear;
For one who is free from sensual pleasures,
there is no sorrow—whence fear?

### 216

From craving (wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]) arises sorrow,
from craving arises fear;
For one who is free from craving,
there is no sorrow—whence fear? 

### 217

Endowed with virtue (morality, ethical conduct [sīla]) and vision (realization [dassana]),
firmly established in the Dhamma, \{who knows the truth} ( who understands the reality, knowing the four noble truths by personal experience [saccavedī]);
Who does what ought to be done,
such a person is dear to the people.

### 218

One who aspires for the ineffable (indescribable, indefinable [anakkhāta]),
and is suffused (permeated, filled [phuṭa]) by it in their mind;
whose mind is unattached to sensual pleasures—
such a one is said to "\{flow upstream} (rising above the current [uddhaṃsota])".

### 219

When one who has been away for a long time,
returns safely from afar;
Their relatives, friends, and well-wishers,
welcome them back with delight (happiness [abhinandati]).

### 220

In the same way, when one who has made merit (good deeds, spiritual wealth [puññā]),
passes on from this world to the next;
Their merits welcome them,
like relatives welcoming a dear one home.
