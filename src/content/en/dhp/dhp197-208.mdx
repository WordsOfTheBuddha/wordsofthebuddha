#### 197

Truly, we live happily,
|free from hatred::free from animosity, friendly [averī]| among the hateful;
Among those who are hostile,
we dwell free from animosity.

#### 198

Truly, we live happily,
|unafflicted::untroubled, free from suffering [anātura]| among the diseased;
Among those who are afflicted,
we dwell free from suffering.

#### 199

Truly, we live happily,
unworried among the |restless::zealously desiring, ambitious, anxiously striving for [ussuka]|;
Among those who are anxious,
we dwell |without anxious striving::not zealously desiring, unagitated [anussuka]|.

#### 200

Truly, we live happily,
for those who have nothing to call their own;
We shall be nourished by |joy::heartfelt or intense joy, feeling of love, rapture lit. lovely feeling [pīti]|,
like the |radiant gods::a class of gods in the pure abodes [ābhassarā + devā]|.

#### 201

Victory breeds hatred,
for the defeated sleep uncomfortably;
|The composed::calmed, tranquil [upasanta]| sleep with ease,
having abandoned |victory and defeat::conquest and loss [jayaparājaya]|.

#### 202

There is no fire like |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]|,
no |distress::calamity, misfortune [kali]| like hatred;
No suffering like the |aggregates::pile of matter and mind that are held onto as a self [khandha]|,
and no happiness greater than |peace::calm, tranquility [santi]|.

#### 203

Hunger is the worst disease,
|conditioned phenomena::fabrications, concoctions, intentional constructions, karmic activity [saṅkhārā]| the worst suffering;
for one who knows this as it actually is,
|Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]| is the highest bliss.

#### 204

|Health::freedom from disease [ārogya]| is the highest gain,
|contentment::satisfaction [santuṭṭhi]| is the greatest wealth;
|Confidence::trust [vissāsa]| is the ultimate kin,
Nibbāna is the highest bliss.

#### 205

Having sipped the flavor of |seclusion::solitude [paviveka]|,
and savored the taste of peace;
One becomes fearless, and free of |harm::injury causing actions, either to oneself or to others [pāpa]|,
while drinking the joy of the Dhamma.

#### 206

Good is the sight of the Noble Ones,
dwelling with them is ever blissful;
Not encountering |immature persons::ones lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]|,
one would always be at ease.

#### 207

One who associates with the immature persons,
|sorrows::grieves [socati]| for a long time;
|Living together with::co-habitation with, close association with [saṃvāsa]| the immature is unpleasant,
like being with an enemy;
But living with the |steadfast::firm, stable, wise [dhīra]| is joyful,
like reunion with one's kin.

#### 208

Therefore—
One should associate with the stable, wise, and well-learned,
the |patient::enduring [dhorayhasīla]|, virtuous, and noble;
Seek and follow such a person,
as the moon follows the path of the zodiac.
