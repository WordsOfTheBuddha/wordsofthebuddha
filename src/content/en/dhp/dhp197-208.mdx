### 197

Truly, we live happily,
\{free from hatred} (free from animosity, friendly [averī]) among the hateful;
Among those who are hostile,
we dwell without animosity.

### 198

Truly, we live happily,
unafflicted (untroubled, free from suffering [anātura]) among the diseased;
Among those who are afflicted,
we dwell unaffected.

### 199

Truly, we live happily,
unworried among the restless (zealously desiring, ambitious, anxiously striving for [ussuka]);
Among those who are anxious,
we dwell without anxiety.

### 200

Truly, we live happily,
for those who have nothing to call their own;
We shall be nourished by joy (heartfelt joy, feeling of love, delight [pīti]),
like the \{radiant gods} (a class of gods in the pure abodes [ābhassarā + devā]).

### 201

Victory breeds hatred,
for the defeated sleep uncomfortably;
\{The composed} (calmed, tranquil [upasanta]) sleep with ease,
having abandoned \{victory and defeat} (conquest and loss [jayaparājaya]).

### 202

There is no fire like passion (desire, infatuation, lust [rāga]),
no distress (calamity, misfortune [kali]) like hatred;
No suffering like the aggregates (pile of matter and mind that are held onto as a self [khandha]),
and no happiness greater than peace (calm, tranquility [santi]).

### 203

Hunger is the worst disease,
\{conditioned things} (fabrications, concoctions, volitional formations, karmic activity [saṅkhāra]) the worst suffering;
for one who knows this as it actually is,
Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]) is the highest bliss.

### 204

Health (freedom from disease [ārogya]) is the highest gain,
contentment (satisfaction [santuṭṭhi]) the greatest wealth;
Confidence (trust [vissāsa]) the ultimate kin,
Nibbāna the highest bliss.

### 205

Having sipped the flavor of seclusion (solitude [paviveka]),
and savored the taste of peace;
One becomes fearless, and free of harm (injury causing actions, either to oneself or to others [pāpa]),
while drinking the joy of the Dhamma.

### 206

Good is the sight of the noble ones,
dwelling with them is ever blissful;
Not encountering \{immature persons} (ones lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]),
one would always be at ease.

### 207

One who associates with the immature persons,
grieves (sorrows [socati]) for a long time;
\{Living together with} (co-habitation with, close association with [saṃvāsa]) the immature is painful,
like being with an enemy;
But living with the stable (firm, wise [dhīra]) is joyful,
like a reunion with one's kin.

### 208

Therefore—
One should associate with the stable, wise, and well-learned,
the patient (enduring [dhorayhasīla]), virtuous, and noble;
Seek and follow such a person,
as the moon follows the path of the stars.
