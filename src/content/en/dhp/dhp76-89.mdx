#### 76

As one who reveals hidden treasure,
one should regard a person who shows your faults;
A wise person who reproves and admonishes,
one should associate with such a wise person;
For one associating with such a person,
things become better, not worse.

#### 77

One should advise and instruct [others],
and reign in whatever is |impolite::vulgar, coarse, bad manners [asabbha]|;
For one is dear to the virtuous,
but to the unvirtuous, one is not dear.

#### 78

Do not associate with |bad::harmful, injurious, destructive, or evil [pāpaka]| friends,
do not associate with |base::vile, mean [adhama]| people;
one should associate with good friends,
one should associate with |best::highest, supreme [uttama]| amongst people.

#### 79

One who is joyous in |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]| dwells at ease,
with a clear and tranquil mind;
In the Dhamma taught by the noble ones,
the wise person always |rejoices::enjoys, takes delight in [ramati]|. 

#### 80

Irrigators direct the water,
|fletchers::arrow makers [usukāra]| shape arrows;
Carpenters shape the wood,
And the wise |tame::master, control [damayanti]| themselves.

#### 81

Just as a solid rock,
is not shaken by the wind;
So too in blame and praise,
the wise do not |waver::shake, fold back [samiñjati]|.

#### 82

Just as a deep lake,
clear and undisturbed;
So too, having heard the teachings,
the wise |become tranquil::become serene, bright, radiant [vippasīdanti]|.

#### 83

Indeed, the |virtuous::good, arahant, awakened being [sappurisā]| renounce [attachment for] everything,
the peaceful do not |babble::chat up, appeal [lapayanti]|, craving sensual pleasures;
When touched |by pleasure::by comfort, by ease [sukhena]| or |by displeasure::by discomfort, by pain [dukhena]|,
the wise do not exhibit |elation or dejection::highs and lows, ups and downs [uccāvacaṃ]|.

#### 84

Not for one's own sake, nor for another's,
nor desiring son, wealth, or land;
One should not wish for prosperity through |misconduct::immoral behavior, unjust means, cheating [adhammena]|,
one should be ethical, righteous and wise.

#### 85

Few among humans are those,
who cross over to the further shore;
But the rest of the people
merely run along the bank.

#### 86

And those who follow the Dhamma,
well-taught and rightly expounded;
Those people will cross over
the realm of death, which is so difficult to escape.

#### 87

Abandoning the dark qualities,
the wise one should cultivate the bright;
Having gone from home to homelessness,
in solitude, which is hard to enjoy.

#### 88

One should desire |delight::pleasure, happiness [abhirati]| there,
having abandoned sensual pleasures, |with nothing::possession-less [akiñcana]|;
The wise one should purify oneself,
from |defilements::impurities [klesa]| of the mind.

#### 89

For those whose mind are |well cultivated::fully developed [subhāvita]|,
in the |factors of awakening::the seven factors of awakening, factors of enlightenment [sambodhiyaṅga]|;
Who, free from attachment,
are devoted to |not grasping::not holding (onto), detaching (from), not taking possession (of) [anupādāya]|;
The ones with taints destroyed, |radiant::luminous, magnificient [jutimant]|,
those are fully quenched in the world.
