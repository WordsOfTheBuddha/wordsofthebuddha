#### 221

One should abandon anger and renounce |conceit::self-view expressed as comparison—seeing oneself as superior, inferior, or equal; the persistent “I am” conceit (asmimāna) that underlies identification and fuels rebirth [māna]|,
and break free from every |fetter::chain, bond, link, thing which binds [saṃyojana]|;
For one unattached to |name and form::mentality and materiality—the integrated structure of mental capacities (intention, attention, contact, feeling, perception) and physical form that together constitute and sustain an individual being [nāmarūpa]|,
owning nothing, |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| does not follow.

#### 222

One who restrains arisen |anger::rage, wrath, fury, indignation [kodha]|,
as one halts a veering chariot;
I call that person a |charioteer::driver [sārathi]|,
others are merely holding the reins.

#### 223

Overcome anger with |non-anger::patience, forbearance, tolerance [akkodha]|,
the bad with what is |good::virtuous, wholesome, beneficial [sādhu]|;
Overcome |stinginess::miserliness, tight-fistedness [kadariya]| with |giving::the act of giving or donating, with an intention to give [dāna]|,
and false speech with truth.

#### 224

Speak what is |true::accurate, correct [sacca]|, yield not to anger,
when asked, give even if you only have a little;
By [cultivating] these three qualities,
one goes to the company of the gods.

#### 225

Those sages who |do not harm::humane, non-violent [ahiṁsaka]|,
continuously |restrained::guarded, controlled [saṃvuta]| in body;
Go to the |stable::epithet of Nibbāna; lit. not fallen [accuta]| state,
where, having gone, |they grieve::they sorrow, they mourn [socare]| no more.

#### 226

For those ever |watchful::alert, vigilant, lucid [jāgaramāna]|,
|training themselves by day and night::practicing in continuously [ahorattānusikkhī]|;
Firmly resolved on |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating; lit. blowing away [nibbāna]|,
the |taints::defilements, pollutants [āsava]| come to an end.

#### 227

This is an ancient saying, Atula,
not something only said today—
They are |blamed::criticized [nindati]| who sit silently,
who often speak are also blamed;
Even one who speaks moderately is blamed,
there is no one in the world |who is not blamed::who is not reproached, who is not impeached [anindita]|.

#### 228

There never was, there never will be,
nor is there now found;
A person who is entirely blamed,
or one who is wholly |praised::approved of, commended [pasaṃsi]|.

#### 229

The one whom the wise praise,
|having examined::investigating, learning about [anuvicca]| day by day;
Of |flawless conduct::unbroken conduct [acchiddavutti]| and |sound judgement::one who is discerning [medhāvī]|,
endowed with virtue, |collectedness::composure, concentration [samāhita]|, and wisdom—

#### 230

Like pure gold |from the Jambu River::Jambu River may have been inspired by real rivers in the Indian subcontinent known for deposits of gold, such as the Son River or Swarna Rekha River, both of which have historical associations with gold deposits [jambonada]|,
who is worthy to criticize such a person?
Even the gods praise that one,
and by |Brahma::God, the first deity to be born at the beginning of a new cosmic cycle and whose lifespan lasts for the entire cycle [brahma]| too, he is praised.

#### 231

One should guard against |irritability in bodily action::harmful bodily behavior, physical agitation [kāyappakopa]|,
be restrained in bodily actions;
Having abandoned |bodily misconduct::killing living beings, harming others, theft, or sexual misconduct [kāyaduccarita]|,
one should practice good bodily conduct.

#### 232

One should guard against |irritability in speech::being agitated when speaking, using harmful speech [vacīpakopa]|,
be restrained in speech;
Having abandoned |verbal misconduct::false speech, harsh speech, divisive speech, idle chatter [vacīduccarita]|,
one should practice good conduct in speech.

#### 233

One should guard against |irritability in thought::mental agitation, mental irritation [manopakopa]|,
be restrained in mind;
Abandoning |mental misconduct::thoughts of sensuality, ill will, harm [manoduccarita]|,
one should practice good conduct in thought.

#### 234

The wise are restrained in bodily action,
restrained in speech;
and restrained in thought,
they are truly well-restrained.
