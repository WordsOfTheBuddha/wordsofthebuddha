### 179

For whom victory cannot be undone,
whose victory no one in the world can undo;
That Buddha, \|whose domain is boundless::having infinite range [anantagocara]|,
\|the traceless one::trackless, having no desires [apada]|—by what path \|will you lead him astray::will misguide, will harm [nessati]|?

### 180

For whom there is no |entanglement::attachment [visattikā]| or |snare::deception [jālinī]|,
and no |craving::wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇhā]| to be found anywhere;
That Buddha, whose domain is boundless,
the traceless one—by what path will you lead him astray?

### 181

Those wise ones who are \|intent on jhāna::devoted to meditation [jhānapasuta]|,
who delight in \|tranquility of renunciation::peace of giving up sensual pleasure [nekkhammūpasama]|—
Even the gods \|hold them dear::care for them [piyāyati]|,
the \|Awakened Ones::epithet of the Buddha, one who has fully understood [sambuddha]|, who are |mindful::fully present [satīmant]|.

### 182

|Hard::difficult, troublesome, rare [kiccha]| it is to acquire a human birth,
hard is the life of mortals;
Rare is the hearing of the true |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
rare is the arising of the Buddhas.

### 183

To avoid all \|injurious [intentions and actions]::harmful, bad, potentially evil [pāpa]|,
to cultivate \|wholesome [intentions and actions]::healthy, beneficial, useful [kusala]|;
And \|purifying one's mind::removing the five hindrances [sacittapariyodapanā]|—
this is the teaching of the Buddhas.

### 184

|Enduring::perseverance in the face of physical or mental hardships [titikkhā]| |patience::acceptance, receptivity in emotional or interpersonal contexts [khantī]| is the highest \|spiritual practice::austerity, ascetic practice [tapa]|,
|Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]| is the \|very best::highest, ultimate [parama]|, the Buddhas declare;
One \|who harms others::who injures others [parūpaghātī]| is not a true renunciant,
nor is one who troubles others a true |ascetic::recluse, holy man, epithet of the Buddha [samaṇa]|.

### 185

\|Not speaking ill::refraining from slander, not blaming others [anūpavāda]| of others, \|not harming::not hurting, non-violence [anūpaghāta]| others,
restraint according to the \|moral code of conduct::monastic code of discipline which promotes harmonious and pure conduct with others [pātimokkha]|;
Knowing \|moderation in::knowing the correct amount of [mattaññutā]| eating,
dwelling in secluded places;
Dedication to the \|higher mind::meditation, mental development, higher consciousness, [adhicitta]|,
this is the teaching of the Buddhas.

### 186

Not by a shower of coins,
can one find satisfaction in \|sensual desire::sensual pleasure [kāma]|;
Sensual pleasures bring little enjoyment and much |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|,
thus the wise understand.

### 187

Even in heavenly sensual pleasures,
he finds no |delight::relish, liking, pleasure [rati]|;
He delights in the \|wearing away of craving::depletion of desire, extinction of longing [taṇhakkhaya]|,
Such is the disciple of the Fully Awakened One.

### 188

Many people take refuge,
in mountains and forests;
Parks, trees and shrines,
\|shaken up::startled [tajjita]| by fear.

### 189

This is not a safe refuge,
that is not the highest refuge;
That is not a refuge,
which brings release from all suffering.

### 190

But one who takes refuge,
in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the |Saṅgha::the community of followers of the Buddha, whether lay or monastic, who have attained to one of the four stages of awakening [saṅgha]|;
Sees the Four Noble Truths,
\|with right wisdom::correct understanding [sammappaññāya]|.

### 191

Suffering, the \|arising of suffering::source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]|,
the \|ending of suffering::ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]|;
And the Noble Eightfold Path,
that leads to the ending of suffering.

### 192

This is a safe refuge,
this is the highest refuge;
Taking refuge here,
one is released from all suffering.

### 193

Rare is the birth of a \|thoroughbred person::extraordinary person, a noble person, Buddha [purisājañña]|,
he is not born everywhere;
Where such a \|stable one::firm, wise [dhīra]| one is born,
that family \|gains ease::thrives comfortably [sukhamedhati]|.

### 194

Good is the arising of the Buddhas,
good is the teaching of the true Dhamma;
Good is the harmony of the Saṅgha,
Good is the spiritual practice of those who live in harmony.

### 195

One who honors those \|worthy of honor::worthy of veneration, reverence [pūjāraha]|,
whether the Buddhas or their disciples;
Who has surmounted \|mental proliferation::various opinions, endless conceptualization [papañca]|,
who has gone beyond \|sorrow and lamentation::wailing and weeping [tiṇṇasokapariddava]|.

### 196

One who honors such ones,
the |quenched::liberated from mental defilements [nibbuta]| and \|fearless ones::who have nothing to fear from anywhere [akutobhaya]|;
No one can measure their gained merit,
saying, 'there is just this much.'
