title: Brāhmaṇa vagga - Chapter 26 - The Sage
description: Dhammapada verses 383–423 redefine 'Brāhmaṇa' (sage) by inner attainment, not birth or appearance. Through effort, a true sage cuts craving, understands reality, and realizes Nibbāna. Fearless, detached, pure, and restrained, they embody non-violence and patience. Free from defilements and attachments, having overcome suffering and rebirth, the sage achieves the ultimate goal, radiating wisdom and peace.

#### 383

With continuous effort, cut off the stream,
dispel sensual desires, O |sage::Brāhmaṇa, a title used by the Buddha for an Arahant, an awakened being [brāhmaṇa]|;
Having known the |wearing away::exhaustion, depletion, gradual destruction [khaya]| of |conditioned phenomena::fabrications, concoctions, intentional constructions, karmic activity [saṅkhārā]|,
be one who knows the |unmade::not created [akata]|.

#### 384

When a sage, through the two qualities [of collectedness and insight],
has gone beyond;
Then all |fetters::bondages, associations, attachments, involvements [saṁyogā]| come to an end,
for one who knows fully.

#### 385

One for whom the far shore, the near shore,
as well as the |far and near shore::other world and this world, duality [pārāpāra]| are not present;
Fearless and |disentangled::disengaged, unfettered [visaṁyutta]|,
him, I call a true sage.

#### 386

One who is meditative, |unblemished::pure, stainless [viraja]| and settled,
|taint-less::undefiled, free from effluents [anāsava]|, having done what needed to be done;
who has reached the ultimate goal,
him I call a true sage.

#### 387

The sun shines by day,
the moon brightens the night;
The warrior shines in his armor,
the sage in meditation;
The Buddha shines resplendent,
all day and all night.

#### 388

One who has renounced evil is called a sage,
through even conduct, he is called an ascetic;
Having cast off his own defilements,
he is thus called one who has gone forth.

#### 389

One should not strike a sage,
nor should a sage retaliate;
Shame on the one who harms a sage,
greater shame still on the one who retaliates.

#### 390

Nothing is better for a sage than,
restraining the mind from what is |dear::beloved [piya]|;
To the extent the intent to harm wears away,
to that extent |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]| subsides.

#### 391

One who has no wrongdoing,
in body, speech, or mind;
Who is fully |restrained::guarded, controlled [saṃvuta]| in all three,
him I call a sage.

#### 392

From whom one would learn the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
as taught by the perfectly Awakened One;
That one should be revered with respect,
like a brahmin [priest] honors the sacred fire.

#### 393

Not by matted hair, nor by lineage,
nor by birth does one become a sage;
In whom truth and Dhamma dwell,
he is pure, he is truly a sage.

#### 394

What use are your matted locks, O |undiscerning one::one lacking discernment, who has not cultivated wisdom, unwise [dummedha]|?
What of your fur garment?
Within you is the |tangle::thicket, jungle, lit. grasping [gahana]| [of passion],
yet you only groom the outside.

#### 395

A rag-robed wanderer,
lean, with veins standing out;
Meditating alone in the forest,
him I call a true sage.

#### 396

I do not call him a sage,
merely because of his lineage or high-born mother;
Such a one is simply called |bhovādi::'bhovādi' serves as a label for a person identified as a Brahmin by birth or social convention, based on such characteristic social markers like using this form of address.|,
If he has |worldly attachments::baggage, possessions [sakiñcana]|;

him I call a true sage.

him I call a true sage.

#### 398

He who has cut off the strap [hatred] and the leather tie [craving],
the halter along with bridle and rein;
He who has lifted the obstacle [ignorance],
him I call a true sage.

#### 399

He who bears without being offended,
abuse, beating, and imprisonment;
whose power, real might, is patience,
him I call a true sage.

#### 400

|Without anger::not cranky, not irritable [akkodhana]|, dutiful,
|virtuous::ethical, moral [sīlavant]|, and |humble::not arrogant, lit. not sinking up [anussada]|;
|Tamed::trained, mastered [danta]|, and bearing the final body,
him I call a true sage.

#### 401

Like water on a lotus leaf,
or a mustard seed on a needle’s tip—
He who does not cling to sensual pleasures,
him I call a true sage.

#### 402

One who knows clearly the wearing away of suffering,
right here and now, within himself;
Who has cast off the burden, is disentangled,
him I call a true sage.

#### 403

One of deep wisdom, |who has cultivated discernment::who has good judgement [medhāvī]|,
who is skilled in knowing what is and what is not the path;
Who has arrived at the |ultimate goal::summum bonum; supreme goal; epithet of Nibbāna [uttamattha]|,
him I call a true sage.

#### 404

Who is |not entangled with::not mixed-up with, aloof from [asaṃsaṭṭha]| householders,
as well as homeless wanderers;
Who does not delight in a dwelling place,

One who has renounced violence,
toward all beings, whether |frail::trembling, with craving [tasa]| or |firm::stable, stationary, without craving [thāvara]|;
who neither |kills::beats, strikes, thrashes, stabs, executes [hanati]| nor causes to kill,
him I call a true sage.

#### 406

Friendly amidst the hostile,
peaceful amidst the violent;
Not grasping where others grasp,
him I call a true sage.

#### 407

One for whom |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]| and |aversion::ill will, hate, hatred, fault-finding attitude, resentment [dosa]|,
and |pride::conceit, egotism, superiority, comparing oneself [māna]| and |contempt::ungratefulness, depreciation, denigration, disrespect, belittlement, disparagement [makkha]| have fallen away;
Like a mustard seed from the tip of a needle,
him I call a true sage.

#### 408

He who utters gentle, instructive,
and truthful words;
|Without insulting::without angrily cursing, without abusing [nābhisajati]| anyone,
him I call a true sage.

#### 409

Whoever in this world does not take what is not given,
whether long or short;
Small or large, attractive or repulsive,
him I call a true sage.
