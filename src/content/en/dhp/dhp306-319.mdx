#### 306

One who speaks falsely falls into |hell::a place of intense suffering, lit. no good fortune [niraya]|,
as does one who, having done wrong, claims, ‘I did not do it’;
Both of them, having passed away, become alike,
people of base actions in the hereafter.

#### 307

Many who wear the ochre robes,
are |endowed with harmful qualities::one who has had a long association of harmful mental qualities - of negligence, laziness, having many wishes, irrational application of mind, lack of situational awareness, having bad friends, pursuing bad habits [pāpadhamma]|, |unrestrained::uncontrolled [asaññata]|;
Endowed with unwholesomeness, through |harmful::injurious, destructive, bad, or evil [pāpaka]| actions,
they are reborn in hell.

#### 308

Better to swallow an iron ball,
blazing like a fiery flame;
Than for an |unprincipled::without regard for ethical conduct [dussīla]| and unrestrained person,
to consume alms given by the people.

#### 309

Four states are experienced by a man who dwells |negligently::inattentively, carelessly [pamatta]|,
who |gets involved with another’s partner::commits adultery [paradārūpasevī]|;
Accumulation of demerit, loss of pleasant sleep,
|blame::criticism, disapproval [nindā]|, and rebirth in hell.

#### 310

Accumulation of demerit and a bad destination,
and brief is the pleasure of one who is frightened;
For this, |authorities::king, ruler, government [rāja]| impose a heavy punishment,
a man therefore should not get involved with another’s partner.

#### 311

Just as |kusa grass::sharp-bladed grass used in the ancient India in ceremonies and symbolic contexts [kusa]|, if wrongly grasped,
cuts the hand;
So too, the |spiritual life::ascetic life, monkhood [sāmañña]|, if wrongly undertaken,
drags one down to hell.

#### 312

Any |unaspirated::lax, slack [sithila]| action,
or any impure observance;
Or a spiritual life that is lived |with uncertainty::with doubt, hesitation, or indecision [saṅkassara]|,
does not bear great fruit.

#### 313

If one acts, one should act with |firmness::unwaveringly [daḷhaṃ]|,
one should apply persistent effort;
For one who is slack after |having gone forth::a homeless spiritual seeker [paribbāja]|,
|just stirs up dust all the more::merely increases mental defilements [bhiyyo ākirate rajaṁ]|.

#### 314

Better is a wrong action not done,
for one later |regrets::suffers remorse, burns [tappati]| a wrong action;
Better is a good action that is done,
for having done it, one does not regret.

#### 315

Just as a |border::frontier, outlying [paccanta]| city,
is |guarded::protected, kept watch over [gutta]| both inside and outside,
so should you watch yourselves,
lest the |opportunity::moment [khaṇa]| slip away;
For those who let their opportunity pass,
grieve, having fallen into hell.

#### 316

|Ashamed of::embarrassed about [lajjati]| what is not shameful,
and not ashamed of what is shameful;
Having adopted wrong views,
beings go to a |bad destination::state of misery [duggati]|.

#### 317

|Fearing::being wary of, being apprehensive of [bhayadassī]| in what is not fearful,
and not fearing in what is truly fearful;
Having adopted wrong views,
beings go to a bad destination.

#### 318

|Seeing fault::perceiving as blameworthy [vajjamatī]| where there is none,
and seeing no fault where there is fault;
Having adopted wrong views,
beings go to a bad destination.

#### 319

Recognizing |fault::error, mistake, wrong [vajja]| in what is faulty,
and no fault in what is faultless;
Having adopted right views,
beings go to a good destination.
