### 273

Of all the paths, the eightfold path is the foremost (best, most important [seṭṭha]),
of all the truths, the four noble truths are the foremost;
of all the mental qualities, the \{fading of desire} (dispassion, detachment [virāga]) is the foremost,
of all the two-footed beings, the \{clear-eyed one} (who can see, gifted with sight [cakkhumant]) is the foremost.

### 274

This is the path—there is no other,
for the purification of vision (perception, spiritual vision [dassana]);
Tread this path,
and you will bewilder Māra (embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]).

### 275

Walking upon this path,
you will make an end of suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]);
I have declared the path,
for the \{removal of thorns} (surgical removal of the dart, an analogy for the afflictions [sallakantana]) with knowing.

### 276

Effort (exertion, application [ātappa]) should be made by you,
the Tathāgatas (one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of the Buddhas [tathāgatā]) only show the way;
The meditators (yogis [jhāyi]) who practice this path,
are liberated (freed [pamokkhati]) from \{Māra's bonds} (shackles of death [mārabandhanā]).

### 277

"All \{conditioned things} (fabrications, concoctions, volitional formations, karmic activity [saṅkhāra]) are impermanent (unstable, transient, unreliable [anicca]),"
when one sees this with wisdom (distinctive knowledge, discernment [pañña]);
Then one becomes \{disenchanted with} (disinterested in, disillusioned with [nibbindati]) suffering,
this is the path to purification.

### 278

"All conditioned things are unsatisfactory ([dukkha]),"
when one sees this with wisdom;
Then one becomes disenchanted with suffering,
this is the path to purification.

### 279

"All phenomena (things, mental qualities [dhammā]) are not-self (essenceless, not suitable to identify with [anatta]),"
when one sees this with wisdom;
Then one becomes disenchanted with suffering,
this is the path to purification.

### 280

One who \{fails to rise up} (does not make an effort [anuṭṭhahāna]) at the right time for making effort,
though young and strong, overcome by laziness (idleness [ālasiya]);
With a mind weighed down by despondent (downcast [saṃsanna]) thoughts, sluggish in action,
such an indolent person does not find the path to wisdom.

### 281

Guarding one's speech, well-restrained in mind,
and doing no unwholesome (unhealthy, unskillful, unbeneficial, or karmically unprofitable [akusala]) actions with the body;
Purify these three modes of action,
and succeed in the path taught by the sage.

### 282

Through meditation (diligence, practice [yoga]), wisdom (discernment [bhūri]) arises,
without meditation, wisdom wanes;
Having known these crossroads,
of development (well-being, prosperity [bhava]) and decline (loss, regress [vibhava]);
One should establish oneself in such a way,
that wisdom continues to grow.

### 283

Cut off the forest (a reference to desire, craving [vana]), not just the tree,
for fear arises from the forest;
Having cut off both the forest and the undergrowth,
become one who is \{without craving} (cool, quenched, freed from the fires of greed, hatred, and illusion [nibbana]), bhikkhus.

### 284

For as long as the undergrowth (subtle attachments, entanglements [vanatha]) is not cut,
even the smallest amount, in a man's heart towards women;
His mind remains enamoured (infatuated, smitten [paṭibaddhamana]),
like a calf suckling its mother.

### 285

Cut off any fondness for oneself,
like a lotus in autumn is plucked by hand;
Cultivate only the path to peace (calm, tranquility [santi]),
Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]), as taught by the \{Fortunate One} (well gone, Accomplished One, epithet of the Buddha [sugata]).

### 286

'Here I will dwell during the rains,
here during winter and summer;'
thus the \{immature person} (lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]) thinks,
not understanding the danger.

### 287

That person, \{obsessed with sons and cattle} (intoxicated by children and possessions [puttapasusammatta]),
with an attached mind;
Like a great flood sweeps away a sleeping village,
death seizes and carries them away.

### 288

There are no sons for refuge (shelter, defense, protection [tāṇa]),
nor father, nor even relatives;
For one \{seized by} (overpowered by [adhipanna]) death,
there is no refuge among kin.

### 289

Understanding the truth of this,
the wise one, restrained by \{ethical conduct} (virtue, moral integrity [sīla]);
should swiftly purify by the way of practice,
leading to Nibbāna.
