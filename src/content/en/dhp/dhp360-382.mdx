#### 360

Restraint with the eye is good,
good is restraint by the ear;
Restraint with the nose is good,
good is restraint by the tongue.

#### 361

Restraint with the body is good,
good is restraint by speech;
Restraint with the mind is good,
good is restraint in all aspects;
A bhikkhu restrained in all aspects,
is freed from all |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.

#### 362

With hands restrained, with feet restrained,
with speech restrained, fully restrained;
With inner joy and a |collected::composed, settled [samāhita]| mind,
content in solitude—him they call a true bhikkhu.

#### 363

A bhikkhu who is restrained in speech,
who speaks wisely, |without agitation::calm, unruffled, not puffed up with pride [anuddhata]|;
Who clarifies both benefit and the |Dhamma::teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]|,
his speech is truly sweet.

#### 364

One who delights and is devoted to the Dhamma,
who thinks and ponders on the Dhamma;
The bhikkhu who recollects the Dhamma,
does not |fall away from::decline in [parihāyati]| the good Dhamma.

#### 365

One |should not look down on::should not have contempt for [nātimaññati]| one's own |gain::benefit, profit [lābha]|,
nor live |envying::wanting, yearning, desiring [pihayanta]| belongings of others;
A bhikkhu who envies others,
does not attain |stillness of mind::stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure, collectedness [samādhi]|.

#### 366

Even if a bhikkhu receives little gain,
but does not look down on his own gain;
Him the gods praise,
one pure in livelihood, who is |energetic::effortful, active [atandita]|.

#### 367

In one who sees no |mine-ness::possession, cherishing, sense of ownership [mamāyita]|,
with respect to |name and form::combination of mental processes [intending, attention, contact, sensation, and perceiving] and physical form that constitute an individual being, the mental and physical objects of consciousness [nāmarūpa]| in every way;
And who does not grieve over what is absent,
he, indeed, is rightly called a "bhikkhu".

#### 368

A bhikkhu who dwells with |loving-kindness::goodwill, friendliness, benevolence [mettā]|,
and has confidence in the Buddha's teaching;
Attains the peaceful state,
the contentment of the |stilling of mental activities::quieting of conditions, Nibbāna [saṅkhārūpasama]|.

#### 369

Bail out this boat, bhikkhu,
when bailed out, it will sail swiftly;
Having cut off |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]| and |aversion::ill will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]|,
from here, one goes to |Nibbāna::complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]|.

#### 370

|Let one cut off five::Five lower fetters of view of personal existence, doubt, adherence to rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill will should be cut off.|, and |abandon five::Five higher fetters of desire for fine-material existence, desire for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance should be abandoned.|,
|and cultivate five further::Five spiritual faculties of confidence, energy, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom should be developed and cultivated.|;
A bhikkhu who overcomes |five kinds of clinging::Clinging at the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness should be overcome.|,
he is called "one who has crossed the flood."

#### 371

Meditate, bhikkhu! Do not be |negligent::inattentive, careless, intoxicated [pamāda]|,
Let not your mind delight in the sense pleasures;
Do not, in negligence, swallow the iron ball,
and cry "This is suffering!" while burning [from it].

#### 372

There is no |jhāna::right collectedness, stillness of mind. Read more in the [AN 5.28 - fivefold right collectedness](/an5.28) discourse. [jhāna]| for the |unwise::lacking in discernment or good sense, immature [apañña]|,
and no wisdom for one who does not [train for] jhāna;
But in whom both jhāna and wisdom are found,
he is truly near to Nibbāna.

#### 373

For a bhikkhu who has entered an |empty dwelling::uninhabited place, a physical home devoid of a self, e.g. a hut, a cave, forest [suññāgāra]|,
with a calm mind;
There arises a divine joy,
from rightly discerning the Dhamma.

#### 374

Whenever one knows with right mindfulness,
the |arising and passing away::appearance and disappearance, formation and dissolution [udayabbaya]| of the |aggregates::the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness; components of mind and body [khandha]|;
There one gains joy and gladness,
that is |deathless::deathless state, epithet of Nibbāna [amata]| for one who knows.

#### 375

This is the foundation,
for a wise bhikkhu;
guarding the sense faculties, contentment,
and restraint per the |moral code of conduct::monastic code of discipline which promotes harmonious and pure conduct with others [pātimokkha]|.

#### 376

Associate with good friends,
of pure livelihood, energetic;
|Be one of welcoming nature::one should be cordial by nature, one should have a friendly disposition [paṭisanthāravutyassa]|,
well mannered;
Then filled with joy,
you will bring suffering to its end.

#### 377

Just as the jasmine,
sheds its withered flowers;
So too, bhikkhus, you should,
shed away |passion::intense desire, strong emotion, infatuation, obsession, lust [rāga]| and |aversion::ill will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]|.

#### 378

Calm in body, calm in speech,
calm in mind and |collected::well-composed, completely calm, totally settled, attentive [susamāhita]|;
a bhikkhu who has renounced the world's bait,
is rightly said to be “one at peace.”

#### 379

By oneself should one stir oneself,
by oneself should one examine oneself;
He who is self-restrained and |mindful::who has recollection, is aware, present [satimant]|,
is a bhikkhu who lives happily.

#### 380

The self is indeed one's own refuge,
for who else could be a refuge?
The self is indeed the destination of oneself;
Therefore, restrain yourself,
as a merchant restrains his thoroughbred horse.

#### 381

A bhikkhu full of joy,
who has confidence in the Buddha's teaching;
Attains the peaceful state,
the contentment of the stilling of mental activities.

#### 382

A young bhikkhu,
who |applies himself to::endeavors in [yuñjati]| the Buddha's teaching,
|Illuminates::brightens [pabhāseti]| the world,
like the moon freed from clouds.
