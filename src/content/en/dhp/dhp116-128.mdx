#### 116

One should hasten to do |good::what is beneficial, wholesome, skillful, meritorious [kalyāṇa]|,
and restrain the mind from |harm::evil, wrong, worthless, bad [pāpaka]|;
For when one is slow in doing good,
the mind takes delight in harm.

#### 117

If a person |commits harm::produces harm to oneself, harm to others, or harm to both|,
they should not do it again and again;
One should not take delight in it,
for the accumulation of harm brings |suffering::discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]|.

#### 118

If a person |does good::produces good for oneself, good for others, or good for both|,
they should do it again and again;
One should take delight in it,
for the accumulation of good brings |contentment::ease, comfort, happiness, pleasure [sukha]|.

#### 119

Even a person who causes harm may see good fortune,
as long as the harm has not ripened;
But when the harm ripens,
then the harm-doer experiences the consequences of harm.

#### 120

Even a doer of good may experience harm,
as long as the good has not ripened;
But when the good ripens,
then the doer of good experiences good results.

#### 121

Do not underestimate harm,
thinking, 'It will not come back to me';
Just as falling drops of water,
fill up a bucket;
So too, the |undiscerning one::childish person, immature person [bāla]| is filled with evil,
accumulating it little by little.

#### 122

Do not underestimate good,
thinking, 'It will not come to me';
Just as falling drops of water,
fill up a bucket;
So too, the |steadfast one::intelligent one, stable, wise [dhīra]| is filled with good,
accumulating it little by little.

#### 123

Just as a merchant with few companions and great wealth,
avoids a dangerous road;
So too, should one wishing to live,
avoid harmful actions like avoiding poison.

#### 124

If there is no wound on the hand,
one may carry poison with the hand;
Poison does not affect one without a wound,
and there is no consequence for one who does not do harm.

#### 125

Whoever |harms::injures, opposes, hates, detests [dussati]| a |blameless::without fault, who is not angry, not upset [appaduṭṭha]| person,
a pure person without blemish;
the harm comes back to that undiscerning one,
like fine dust that is thrown against the wind.

#### 126

Some are born in a womb,
evil-doers arise in hell;
The |well-conducted::virtuous [sugatino]| go to heaven,
and those |free from defilements::without mental effluents, taintless [anāsavā]| attain final liberation.

#### 127

Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the sea,
nor by entering a mountain cave;
No place exists in the world,
where staying, one might escape from the result of their |evil deeds::unwholesome actions, harmful actions, misconduct [pāpakammā]|.

#### 128

Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the sea,
nor by entering a mountain cave;
No place exists in the world,
where staying, one might escape from death.
