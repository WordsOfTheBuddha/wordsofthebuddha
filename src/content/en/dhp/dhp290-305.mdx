### 290

If, by giving up a \{limited happiness} (small comfort [mattāsukha]),
one sees vast happiness;
The wise one should renounce the limited happiness,
\{having seen} (considering [sampassanta]) the vast happiness.

### 291

\{Imposing suffering on another} (causing another discomfort [paradukkhūpadhāna]),
one seeks their own happiness;
Living entangled with animosity (hatred, ill-will, hostility [vera]),
they are not freed from animosity.

### 292

When what should be done is neglected,
and what should not be done is done instead;
For those who are arrogant (conceited, haughty [unnaḷa]) and negligent (inattentive, careless, intoxicated [pamatta]),
their \{mental defilements} (mental outflows, discharges, taints [āsava]) grow.

### 293

For those who are well-established in effort,
with mindfulness of the body always present;
Who do not pursue (practice, cultivate [sevati]) what should not be done,
and are persistent (acting continuously [sātaccakārī]) in what should be done;
For those mindful and \{fully aware} (with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]),
their mental defilements come to an end.

### 294

Having slain mother (this is a reference to craving) and father (this is a reference to conceit),
and \{two kings of the warrior class} (this is a reference to eternalism and annihilationism);
Having wiped out the kingdom (this is a reference to sense organs and sense objects) along with its treasurer (this is a reference to attachment and lust),
the brahmin proceeds untroubled (undisturbed, calm, free from affliction [anīgha]).

### 295

Having slain mother and father,
and two brahman kings;
And a tiger (a reference to the five mental hindrances, symbolizing a perilous path infested with tigers) as the fifth,
the brahmin proceeds untroubled.

### 296

The disciples of Gotama,
always wake up thoroughly [refreshed];
Those who day and night,
are continuously (regularly, reliably [nicca]) immersed in the Buddha.

### 297

The disciples of Gotama,
always wake up thoroughly refreshed;
Those who day and night,
are continuously immersed in the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]).

### 298

The disciples of Gotama,
always wake up thoroughly refreshed;
Those who day and night,
are continuously immersed in the Saṅgha (the community of followers of the Buddha, whether lay or monastic, who have attained to one of the four stages of awakening [saṅgha]).

### 299

The disciples of Gotama,
always wake up thoroughly refreshed;
Those who day and night,
are continuously immersed in the mindfulness of body.

### 300

The disciples of Gotama,
always wake up thoroughly refreshed;
Those who day and night,
have a mind that delights in non-violence (harmlessness [ahiṃsā]).

### 301

The disciples of Gotama,
always wake up thoroughly refreshed;
Those who day and night,
have a mind that delights in cultivation (development, meditation [bhāvanā]).

### 302

Difficult to undertake is the homeless life, difficult it is to delight in it,
also difficult and sorrowful to stay in is the household life;
Suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]) arises from living together with those different [in minds],
suffering pursues the traveler [wandering in the cyclic existence];
Therefore, do not be [an aimless] traveler,
do not let suffering pursue you.

### 303

Endowed with faith (confidence, conviction [saddha]) and virtue (ethical conduct, moral integrity [sīla]),
who has fame and wealth;
Wherever he goes,
there he is honored (venerated [pūjita]).

### 304

The peaceful shine (illuminate, radiate [pakāseti]) from afar,
like the Himalayan peaks;
But the \{not still} (not calm, unpeaceful [asanta]) are not seen,
like arrows shot in the night.

### 305

Sitting alone, sleeping alone,
who wanders alone, who is energetic (without laziness [atandita]);
Who restrains himself alone,
will find delight in \{solitude in the wilderness} (edge of the forest [vananta]).
