	`Keen on speaking in the midst of an assembly,\ndesiring praise, one becomes anxious;\nWhen refuted, one feels humiliated,\nshaken by blame, one seeks faults in others. - SnP 4.8`,
	`When their argument is found wanting,\nand the judges consider it refuted;\nThe defeated debater laments in sorrow,\nthinking, ‘I have been surpassed,’ he moans. - SnP 4.8`,
	`These disputes have arisen among ascetics,\nin these, there is both elation and dejection;\nAlso seeing this, one should refrain from debates,\nfor there is no other benefit than praise and gain. - SnP 4.8`,
	`If, however, one is praised there,\nhaving declared their doctrine before the assembly;\nOne is elated by this and swells with pride,\nhaving obtained the end their mind desired. - SnP 4.8`,
	`That pride becomes the ground for their downfall,\nfilled with conceit, they speak arrogantly;\nHaving seen this too, one should not dispute,\nfor the wise say this does not bring purity. - SnP 4.8`,
	`Just as a hero, nourished on the king’s food,\nstrides forth roaring, craving a foe;\nBy that same urge, one should withdraw instead [from a debate],\nfor there was no prior reason for this fight. - SnP 4.8`,
	`Those who cling to their views and argue,\nsaying ‘this alone is true,’ and disputing;\nTell them, “There’s no point in that,”\nfor with debate arises a debater. - SnP 4.8`,
	`But those wander having disarmed,\nnot opposing one view with another;\nWhat can you gain from them [by debating],\nfrom those who have grasped nothing as supreme? - SnP 4.8`,
	`Not by view, not by learning, not by knowledge,\nnor by rules and observances does one claim purity;\nBy lack of view, by lack of learning,\nby lack of knowledge, by lack of rules and observances—not by that either;\nLetting go of these, not grasping,\nthe tranquil one, not depending on, does not yearn for existence. - SnP 4.9`,
	`One who thinks themself equal, superior, or inferior,\nmight engage in disputes because of this;\nNot shaking among these three distinctions,\nthe sage does not think of being equal or superior. - SnP 4.9`,
	`Having left home to roam without abode,\nin the village, the sage forms no intimate ties;\nVoid of sense desires, without preferences,\nthey would not engage in contentious talk with people. - SnP 4.9`,
	`As a thorny-stemmed lotus, born in the water,\nis unstained by water and mud;\nSo too, the sage, a proponent of peace, without greed,\nis unstained by sensual pleasures and the world. - SnP 4.9`,
	`One who has complete understanding is not dependent on a view or personal belief,\nthey do not attain pride, for they are not identified with those things;\nThey are not led by doing, nor by learning,\nthey are not drawn to any abodes. - SnP 4.9`,
	`For one detached from perception, there are no ties,\nFor one liberated by wisdom, there are no delusions;\nBut those who cling to perceptions and views,\nwander in the world entangled in conflicts. - SnP 4.9`,
	`Not attached to what is yet to come,\nnot sorrowful over what has gone by;\nWho examines distinctions in all contacts,\nthat one is not led astray by views. - SnP 4.10`,
	`One who is equanimous, ever mindful,\nhe does not think himself to be equal,\nsuperior or inferior in the world:\nfor him, there is no prominence. - SnP 4.10`,
	`I call him ‘peaceful’,\nwho is indifferent to sensual pleasures;\nIn him, no knots are found,\nfor he has crossed beyond attachment. - SnP 4.10`,
	`Whether he is called this or that,\nby ordinary persons, or by ascetics and brahmins;\nOne who gives no importance to any of it,\nthus, remains unmoved amid views. - SnP 4.10`,
	`Free of craving and without stinginess,\nthe sage does not speak [of himself],\nas superior, equal, or inferior;\nNot holding to a construct—he is unconstructed. - SnP 4.10`,
	`For whom there is no ‘mine’ in the world,\nwho does not sorrow over what is not present;\nNot wandering about or holding to mental objects,\nhe is truly said to be ‘peaceful’. - SnP 4.10`,
	`Quarrels and disputes arise from what is pleasing,\nas do lamentation, sorrow, and mutual envy,\nconceit and arrogance along with mutual slander;\nQuarrels and disputes are tied up with selfishness,\nand when disputes arise, divisive talk follows. - SnP 4.11`,
	`Pleasing things in the world arise from desire,\nas do states of greed that wander in the world;\nHopes and aims likewise arise from this—\nwhich a person holds concerning the future. - SnP 4.11`,
	`When people in the world say, ‘this is pleasant, this is unpleasant,’\ndesire arises depending on that;\nHaving seen the decline and coming-to-be of forms,\na person forms judgment in the world. - SnP 4.11`,
	`Anger, false speech, and doubt,\nthese things, too, arise when the duality of pleasant and unpleasant exists;\nOne doubtful should train on the path of insight,\nhaving known, the ascetic has stated these things. - SnP 4.11`,
	`The pleasant and unpleasant arise from contact,\nwhen contact does not exist, they do not come to be;\nAs to this matter of decline and coming-to-be,\nit originates from this. - SnP 4.11`,
	`Contact arises dependent on name and form,\nPossessions spring from wishing;\nWhen wishing does not exist, there is no taking as ‘mine’;\nwhen form has ceased, contacts do not touch one. - SnP 4.11`,
	`Neither aware of perception, nor with deluded perception,\nnot non-percipient, nor percipient of what has ceased;\nFor one who attends thus, form ceases,\nfor proliferation of concepts are based on perception. - SnP 4.11`,
	`Having known these [views] to be ‘dependent,’ and,\nknowing what they depend on, the sage, inquiring;\nHaving understood, is freed, and enters no dispute,\nthe steadfast one does not settle upon any state of existence. - SnP 4.11`,
	`If one who does not approve another’s doctrine,\nis said to be a worthless fool, deficient in wisdom;\nThen surely all are fools, utterly deficient in wisdom,\nfor all are entrenched in their own views. - SnP 4.12`,
	`If by their own view, they are purified,\nwith perfected understanding, skill, and intelligence;\nThen there is none among them lacking in wisdom,\nfor their views are similarly reached. - SnP 4.12`,
	`When one takes their own view as true,\nthey regard the other a fool. - SnP 4.12`,
	`Truth, indeed, is one—there is no second,\nwhich, if understood, would end disputes among beings;\nYet ascetics each proclaim their own diverse ‘truths,’\nthat is why they do not all speak as one. - SnP 4.12`,
	`Truths surely are not many and diverse,\nexcept by [mistakenly] perceiving permanence in the world;\nRelying on speculation, they theorize their views,\nand thus declare a duality of ‘truth’ and ‘falsehood.’ - SnP 4.12`,
	`Through what is seen, heard, sensed, or by ethics and observances—\ndependent on these, they perceive disrespect;\nTaking a stand upon judgment, being thrilled,\nthey declare: ‘The other is a fool, unskilled.’ - SnP 4.12`,
	`They regard another as a fool on the same grounds,\nby which they proclaim themselves as skilled;\nClaiming to be an expert by their own authority,\nthey disparage another while conveying the same thing. - SnP 4.12`,
	`Caught up in an extreme view,\nintoxicated by conceit, imagining oneself as perfected;\nOne mentally anoints oneself,\nfor that view of theirs is adopted in such a manner. - SnP 4.12`,
	`If one is deficient because of another’s word,\nthen that other is similarly deficient in wisdom;\nIf by one’s own authority, one can be declared steadfast, with perfect knowledge,\nthen no one would be a fool among ascetics. - SnP 4.12`,
	`‘Those who assert a teaching different from this,\nhave failed to reach purity, and are incomplete’—\nThus the sectarians speak in diverse ways,\nfor they are infatuated with passion for their own views. - SnP 4.12`,
	`‘Here alone is purity,’ so they claim,\nthey say there is no purification in other teachings;\nThus the sectarians, diversely entrenched,\nstand firm in asserting their own path. - SnP 4.12`,
	`Asserting firmly in one’s own way,\nwhom here could they call a fool?\nIt is they themselves who would stir up dispute,\nby calling another a fool of impure character. - SnP 4.12`,
	`Based on a judgment, taking themselves as the measure,\nthey enter upon further disputes in the world;\nHaving abandoned all judgments,\na person does not stir disputes in the world. - SnP 4.12`,
	`Praise won by arguing is a small thing, not sufficient for peace,\nI say praise and blame are two fruits of a dispute;\nHaving seen this too, one should not start arguments,\nseeing safety in the ground of non-dispute. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Whatever common opinions there are,\na wise person does not get involved in them;\nUninvolved, what entanglement could they have,\nwhen not basing their acceptance on what is seen or heard. - SnP 4.13`,
	`They who hold conduct supreme claim purity via restraint,\nhaving taken up a vow, they devote themselves [to it];\n[thinking]: ‘Let’s train here, then there will be purity,’\nthough speaking expertly, they are led back to existence. - SnP 4.13`,
	`If one falls away from their precepts and vows,\nthey shake, having failed in their task;\nThey pray and crave for purity,\nlike one on a journey who has lost their travel group. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Having abandoned all precepts and vows,\nand deeds, whether blameworthy or blameless;\nNot aspiring for either purity or impurity,\none should be detached, for the sake of peace. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Relying on what is shunned,\nor either on what is seen, heard, or sensed;\nthey cry out for purity with lofty voices,\nyet remain bound by craving for various states of existence. - SnP 4.13`,
	`For one who longs, there are yearnings,\nand trembling too over ideas they have formulated;\nBut for one here who has no passing away or rebirth,\nWhy would they tremble? For what would they long? - SnP 4.13`,
	`They declare their own teaching perfect,\nand another’s teaching inferior;\nThus, entering disputes, they argue,\neach proclaiming their own opinion as truth. - SnP 4.13`,
	`If one is inferior when ridiculed by another,\nno one in any teaching could be distinguished;\nFor many speak against another’s teaching,\nwhile firmly advocating their own. - SnP 4.13`,
	`They venerate their own teachings,\njust as they praise their own paths;\nIf so, then all doctrines would be true,\nyet to them, purity is exclusively theirs. - SnP 4.13`,
	`For the sage, there is no being led by others,\nno evaluating among teachings and grasping tightly;\nTherefore they have gone beyond disputes,\nfor they do not see another’s teaching as supreme. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Saying, ‘I know, I see, it is like this in actuality,’\nsome here fall back on purity through a view;\nBut if they have really seen, what good is that view to them,\noverlooking [what matters], they assert purity by another. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Seeing, a person will find name and form,\nand having seen, it is just these that they could know;\nWhether they see much or little, as per their liking,\nnot by that do the skilled declare purity. - SnP 4.13`,
	`One entrenched in a view is not easily instructed,\nholding their own formulated view foremost;\nWhatever they depend on, calling it good,\nclaiming purity there—they think they have truly seen. - SnP 4.13`,
	`The sage does not speculate on concepts,\nthey are not a follower of views nor an adherent of knowledge;\nHaving known common opinions,\nthey regard with equanimity where others grasp. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Having untied the knots here in the world,\nthe sage does not take sides when disputes occur;\nPeaceful among the unpeaceful, they remain equanimous,\nnot grasping where others grasp. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Having abandoned former taints and not making new ones,\nnot driven by desire nor a proponent of dogma;\nReleased from speculative views, that steadfast one,\nuntainted by the world, is free of self-blame. - SnP 4.13`,
	`One is disarmed with respect to all states of mind,\nin whatever is seen, heard, or sensed;\nWith their burden dropped, the sage is freed,\nnot constructing ideas, not abstaining, not wishing. - SnP 4.13`,
	`Reflecting on the source of conceptual proliferation,\nthe wise should cut off the notion ‘I am;’\nWhatever cravings there may be internally,\none should train ever mindfully for their removal. - SnP 4.14`,
	`Whatever things one might know,\nwhether internally or externally;\nOne should not be rigid on account of that,\nfor that is not called quenching by the wise. - SnP 4.14`,
	`Because of this one should not think oneself better,\nnor should one consider oneself inferior or equal;\nWhen touched by various kinds of experiences,\none should not regard them personally, nor construct [concepts and opinions]. - SnP 4.14`,
	`It is internally that one should achieve peace,\none should not seek peace through another;\nFor one who is at peace within themself,\nthere is nothing taken up, much less cast aside. - SnP 4.14`,
	`Just as in the middle of the ocean,\nno wave arises and the ocean remains steady;\nSo too, one should be steady, unruffled,\nnot making any swelling [of conceit] anywhere. - SnP 4.14`,
	`One should not have longing in the eyes,\nand should block street talk with the ears;\nOne should not crave for flavors,\nand one should not cherish anything in the world as ‘mine.’ - SnP 4.14`,
	`When touched by an experience,\none should not lament anywhere;\nOne should not yearn for existence,\nnor should one tremble amid fearful conditions. - SnP 4.14`,
	`One should be a meditator, and not cultivate wanderlust,\none should abstain from remorse and avoid negligence;\nIn tranquil seats and resting places,\none should dwell. - SnP 4.14`,
	`One should not overindulge in sleep,\nand should cultivate wakefulness with continuous effort;\nLaziness, hypocrisy, laughter, and amusement,\nsexual activity, and self-adornment—one should abandon these. - SnP 4.14`,
	`One should not practice sorcery, nor interpret dreams,\nauspicious signs, nor practice astrology;\nNor interpret animal howls, nor promote conception,\nor healing—a disciple should not practice these. - SnP 4.14`,
	`One should not be stirred by blame,\nnor should one become arrogant when praised;\nGreed along with stinginess,\nanger and divisive talk—one should dispel these. - SnP 4.14`,
	`A bhikkhu should not engage in buying and selling,\nand should not speak ill at all;\nOne should not be overly fond of the village,\nnor should one address people out of desire for gain. - SnP 4.14`,
	`One should not be boastful,\nnor should one speak with an ulterior motive;\nOne should not train in brashness,\nnor should one engage in contentious talk. - SnP 4.14`,
	`One should not be led into false speech,\nnor should one intentionally do anything deceptive;\nWhether by livelihood or by wisdom,\nor by ethics and observances—one should not look down on another. - SnP 4.14`,
	`When provoked, having heard many words,\nwhether from ascetics or from common folk;\nOne should not respond harshly,\nfor those at peace do not retaliate. - SnP 4.14`,
	`Having comprehended the Dhamma,\ninvestigating, a bhikkhu should train ever mindfully;\nHaving known quenching as peace,\none should be diligent in Gotama’s dispensation. - SnP 4.14`,
	`He is unvanquished for he is the supreme being,\nwho is self-realized in Dhamma, not hearsay;\nTherefore, in the Blessed One’s dispensation,\none should train ever diligently with reverence. - SnP 4.14`,
	`Fear arises from arming oneself,\nobserve the people involved in conflict. - SnP 4.15`,
	`Having seen the population floundering,\nlike fish in a pool with little water;\nHaving seen them at odds with one another,\nfear came upon me. - SnP 4.15`,
	`The world was completely essenceless,\nall the directions were shaken [by impermanence];\nDesiring a sanctuary for myself,\nI did not see any place uninhabited. - SnP 4.15`,
	`Having seen those hostile even at the end,\ndissatisfaction came upon me;\nThen I discerned the dart here,\nhard to perceive, nestled within the heart. - SnP 4.15`,
	`Whoever is struck by the dart [of suffering],\nruns astray in all directions;\nBut having drawn out that very dart,\none does not run or sink down. - SnP 4.15`,
	`Whatever things are clung to in the world,\none should not be engrossed in them;\nCompletely piercing through sensual pleasures,\nOne should train for one’s own quenching. - SnP 4.15`,
	`One should be truthful, unassuming,\nwithout deceit, and devoid of divisive speech;\nWithout anger, the sage should cross beyond,\nthe evil of greed and acquisitiveness. - SnP 4.15`,

	`Greed, I say, is the great flood,\nits current, I say, is longing;\nIts support is conceptualization,\nthe swamp of sensuality is difficult to escape. - SnP 4.15`,
	`Not straying from the truth, the sage,\nthe Awakened One stands on firm ground;\nHaving relinquished all,\nhe is indeed called peaceful. - SnP 4.15`,
	`One indeed is wise who has perfect knowledge,\nhaving known the Dhamma, one is independent;\nConducting themself rightly in the world,\nthey do not long for anything here. - SnP 4.15`,
	`Whoever here has overcome sensual pleasures,\nthe bond in the world so hard to overcome;\nThey do not grieve, do not fret,\nhaving cut the stream [of craving], they are unchained. - SnP 4.15`,
	`Dry up what pertains to the past,\nlet there be nothing for you afterwards;\nIf you do not grasp in the middle,\nyou will fare on in peace. - SnP 4.15`,
