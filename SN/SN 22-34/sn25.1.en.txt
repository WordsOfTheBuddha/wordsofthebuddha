Discourse on Eye

At SƒÅvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the ear is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the nose is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the tongue is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the body is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; the mind is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

Bhikkhus, one who has faith and conviction in these phenomena (dhammas) in this way is called a faith-follower, who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of awakened beings, has left behind the plane of ordinary individuals; such a one is incapable of performing an action that would lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts; and is incapable of dying without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.

Bhikkhus, one for whom these phenomena are accepted through wisdom after pondering over them to a sufficient degree is called a dhamma-follower, who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of awakened beings, has left behind the plane of ordinary individuals; such a one is incapable of performing an action that would lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts; and is incapable of dying without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.

Bhikkhus, one who knows and sees these phenomena in this way is called a stream-enterer, no longer subject to rebirth in lower realms, fixed in destiny, and bound for full awakening."
