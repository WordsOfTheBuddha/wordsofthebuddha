Seeing Impermanence leads to Nibbāna

"I will teach you the path that leads to Nibbāna, bhikkhus. Listen closely.

And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to Nibbāna?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees the eye as impermanent, sees forms as impermanent, sees eye-consciousness as impermanent, sees eye-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as impermanent.

He sees the ear as impermanent, hears sounds as impermanent, sees ear-consciousness as impermanent, sees ear-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises with ear-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as impermanent.

He sees the nose as impermanent, smells as impermanent, sees nose-consciousness as impermanent, sees nose-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises with nose-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as impermanent.

He sees the body as impermanent, tactile sensations as impermanent, sees body-consciousness as impermanent, sees body-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises with body-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as impermanent.

He sees the tongue as impermanent, tastes as impermanent, tongue-consciousness as impermanent, tongue-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as impermanent.

He sees the mind as impermanent, phenomena as impermanent, mind-consciousness as impermanent, mind-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he sees that too as impermanent.

This, bhikkhus, is the path leading to Nibbāna."
