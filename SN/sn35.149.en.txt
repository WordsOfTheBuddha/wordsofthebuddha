Seeing Not-self leads to Nibbāna

"I will teach you the path that leads to Nibbāna, bhikkhus. Listen closely.

And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to Nibbāna?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees the eye as not-self, sees forms as not-self, sees eye-consciousness as not-self, sees eye-contact as not-self. Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he sees that too as not-self.

He sees the ear as not-self, hears sounds as not-self, sees ear-consciousness as not-self, sees ear-contact as not-self. Whatever feeling arises with ear-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he sees that too as not-self.

He sees the nose as not-self, smells as not-self, sees nose-consciousness as not-self, sees nose-contact as not-self. Whatever feeling arises with nose-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he sees that too as not-self.

He sees the tongue as not-self, tastes as not-self, sees tongue-consciousness as not-self, sees nose-contact as not-self. Whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as its condition - whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he sees that too as not-self. 

He sees the body as not-self, tactile sensations as not-self, sees body-consciousness as not-self, sees body-contact as not-self. Whatever feeling arises with body-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he sees that too as not-self.

He sees the mind as not-self, phenomena as not-self, mind-consciousness as not-self, mind-contact as not-self. Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as its condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he sees that too as not-self.

This, bhikkhus, is the path leading to Nibbāna."
