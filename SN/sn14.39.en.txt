The Third Discourse on Ascetics and Brahmins

At SƒÅvatthi.

"Those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand the earth element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; the water element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; the fire element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; the air element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, such, bhikkhus, among ascetics or brahmins are neither considered ascetics among ascetics nor brahmins among brahmins; nor do they, having realized it for themselves with direct knowledge, abide in peace in this very life.

But, bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who understand the earth element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; the water element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; the fire element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; the air element, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, such, bhikkhus, among ascetics or brahmins are considered ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins; and they, having realized it for themselves with direct knowledge, abide in peace in this very life."
