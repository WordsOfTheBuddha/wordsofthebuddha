By seeing these aggregates in this way, one becomes disenchanted with form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Through disenchantment, one becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, one is liberated. With liberation, there comes the knowledge that one is liberated, and one understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'"}]}

Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu, through solitude from attachments and by abandoning unwholesome mental qualities, with the complete internal stilling of bodily agitation, secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental qualities, enters and dwells in the first jhāna. This jhāna is characterized by reflection and examination of thoughts, and is filled with joy (rapture) and pleasure that are born from seclusion. In this state, he perceives whatever phenomena are present — whether form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness — as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that world.
