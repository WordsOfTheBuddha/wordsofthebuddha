But when this person becomes old, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, he declines from that lucidity of wisdom.' But it should not be seen like this, Sāriputta. I, Sāriputta, am now old, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, being eighty years old. Here, Sāriputta, I have four disciples who live for a hundred years, endowed with the highest mindfulness, retention, persistence, and lucidity of wisdom. Just as, Sāriputta, a strong archer, trained, practiced, experienced, with little difficulty could shoot an arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, so too, with such highest mindfulness, retention, persistence, and lucidity of wisdom, they might repeatedly ask me questions about the four foundations of mindfulness. Each time they asked, I would answer, and having answered, they would remember my answers and would not ask again about what had been answered. Except when eating, drinking, chewing, or savoring food, performing bodily functions, or resting to dispel fatigue, the Tathāgata's teaching of the Dhamma would remain uninterrupted, as would the Tathāgata's speech on the Dhamma and responses to questions. Even if these four disciples, who live for a hundred years, were to attend to me on a stretcher after a hundred years pass, there would be no change in the lucidity of the Tathāgata's wisdom."}]}
