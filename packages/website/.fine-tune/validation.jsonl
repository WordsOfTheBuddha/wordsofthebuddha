Seated at one side, the venerable Kacc\u0101nagotta said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"'Right view, right view,' it is said, venerable sir. To what extent, venerable sir, is there right view?\"\n\n\"The world, Kacc\u0101na, for the most part depends on a duality \u2014 on the notion of existence and non-existence.\n\nBut for one who sees the arising of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, the notion of non-existence in regard to the world does not occur. And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, the notion of existence in regard to the world does not occur.\n\nThis world, Kacc\u0101na, is for the most part bound by engagement, grasping, and insistence.\n\nBut one who does not approach, grasp, or insist upon any mental standpoint, adherence, or underlying tendency, who has no uncertainty or doubt that what arises is only suffering arising and what ceases is only suffering ceasing, his knowledge about this is independent of others.\n\nIn this way, Kacc\u0101na, there is right view.\n\n'Everything exists,' Kacc\u0101na, this is one extreme.\n\n'Everything does not exist,' this is the second extreme.\n\nAvoiding these two extremes, the Tath\u0101gata teaches the Dhamma by the middle way:\n\n'With ignorance as condition, formations arise; with formations as condition, consciousness arises; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form arises; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases arise; with the six sense bases as condition, contact arises; with contact as condition, feeling arises; with feeling as condition, craving arises; with craving as condition, clinging arises; with clinging as condition, continued existence arises; with continued existence as condition, birth arises; with birth as condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise. Thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.\n\nWith the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of formations; with the cessation of formations, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of continued existence; with the cessation of continued existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus there is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.'\""}

And what, bhikkhus, is the proximate cause for birth? 'Continued existence' should be said. Indeed, bhikkhus, I declare continued existence to be with proximate cause, not without proximate cause. And what, bhikkhus, is the proximate cause for continued existence? 'Clinging (grasping/holding on)' should be said. Indeed, bhikkhus, I declare clinging to be with proximate cause, not without proximate cause. And what, bhikkhus, is the proximate cause for clinging? 'Craving' should be said. Indeed, bhikkhus, I declare craving to be with proximate cause, not without proximate cause.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the proximate cause for craving? 'Feeling' should be said... 'Contact' should be said... 'The six sense bases' should be said... 'Name and Form' should be said... 'Consciousness' should be said... 'Formations' should be said. Indeed, bhikkhus, I declare formations to be with proximate cause, not without proximate cause. And what, bhikkhus, is the proximate cause for formations? 'Ignorance (misapprehension of how things have come to be)' should be said.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, ignorance is the proximate cause for formations, formations are the proximate cause for consciousness, consciousness is the proximate cause for name-and-form, name-and-form is the proximate cause for the six sense bases, the six sense bases are the proximate cause for contact, contact is the proximate cause for feeling, feeling is the proximate cause for craving, craving is the proximate cause for clinging, clinging is the proximate cause for continued existence, continued existence is the proximate cause for birth, birth is the proximate cause for suffering, suffering is the proximate cause for faith, faith is the proximate cause for joy, joy is the proximate cause for rapture, rapture is the proximate cause for tranquility, tranquility is the proximate cause for ease, ease is the proximate cause for collectedness, collectedness is the proximate cause for knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be, knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be is the proximate cause for disenchantment, disenchantment is the proximate cause for dispassion, dispassion is the proximate cause for release, and release is the proximate cause for the knowledge of ending.\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, when a great downpour occurs atop a mountain, the cascading water naturally progresses, filling up the mountain's hollows, gullies, and crevices. These, once filled, replenish the small ponds. The small ponds, upon reaching their capacity, replenish the larger ponds. The larger ponds, once full, replenish the streams. The streams, having been replenished, fill the rivers. The rivers, upon being filled, replenish the great ocean.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, ignorance is the proximate cause for formations, formations are the proximate cause for consciousness, consciousness is the proximate cause for name-and-form, name-and-form is the proximate cause for the six sense bases, the six sense bases are the proximate cause for contact, contact is the proximate cause for feeling, feeling is the proximate cause for craving, craving is the proximate cause for clinging, clinging is the proximate cause for continued existence, continued existence is the proximate cause for birth, birth is the proximate cause for suffering, suffering is the proximate cause for faith, faith is the proximate cause for joy, joy is the proximate cause for rapture, rapture is the proximate cause for tranquility, tranquility is the proximate cause for ease, ease is the proximate cause for collectedness, collectedness is the proximate cause for knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be, knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be is the proximate cause for disenchantment, disenchantment is the proximate cause for dispassion, dispassion is the proximate cause for release, and release is the proximate cause for the knowledge of ending."}

He teaches the Dhamma that is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with both the meaning and the phrasing; he proclaims the spiritual life that is entirely complete and pure. This, bhikkhus, is the first kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.\n\nAgain, bhikkhus, a disciple of that same teacher is an Arahant with taints exhausted, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the highest goal, exhausted the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through right wisdom. He teaches the Dhamma that is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with both the meaning and the phrasing; he proclaims the spiritual life that is entirely complete and pure. This, bhikkhus, is the second kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, a disciple of that same teacher who is a trainee, on the path, learned, and endowed with virtuous conduct.

This, bhikkhus, is the third kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans. These three kinds of persons, bhikkhus, arise in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.\"\n\nThe Blessed One spoke thus, it is said:\n\n\"Indeed, the teacher, the first great seer in the world,\nhis follower, a disciple with a developed mind;\nAnd another, on the path, still in training,\nlearned and endowed with virtuous conduct.\n\nThese three, the best among gods and humans,\nilluminators, expounding the Dhamma;\nThey open the door to the deathless state,\nreleasing many people from their bonds.\n\nWho, guided by the unsurpassed teacher,\nfollow the well-taught path;\nHere itself, they make an end to suffering,\nthose diligent in the Blessed One's teaching.\"\n\nThis matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard."}

At that time, the venerable Khemaka was residing at the Jujube Tree Park, and he was sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill.\n\nThen, in the evening, those elder bhikkhus, having come out of seclusion, addressed the venerable D\u0101saka: \"Come, friend D\u0101saka, go to the bhikkhu Khemaka and speak to him thus: 'The elders, friend Khemaka, ask whether you are bearing up, whether you are enduring, whether your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and whether there is a sign of their subsiding and not increasing.'\"\n\n\"Yes, friends,\" the venerable D\u0101saka replied to the elder bhikkhus, and he went to the venerable Khemaka. Having gone there, he spoke to the venerable Khemaka thus:\n\n\"The elders, friend Khemaka, ask whether you are bearing up, whether you are enduring, whether your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and whether there is a sign of their subsiding and not increasing.\"\n\n\"Friend, I am not bearing up, not enduring, my painful feelings are not subsiding but increasing, and there is no sign of their subsiding,\" replied Khemaka.\n\nThen the venerable D\u0101saka returned to the elder bhikkhus and reported: \"Friend Khemaka said: 'I am not bearing up, not enduring, my painful feelings are not subsiding but increasing, and there is no sign of their subsiding.'\"\n\nThe elders said: \"Come, friend D\u0101saka, go again to Khemaka and speak to him thus: 'The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. Do you, venerable Khemaka, regard any of these five aggregates as self or as belonging to self?'\"\n\n\"Yes, friends,\" D\u0101saka replied to the elder bhikkhus and went again to Khemaka. Having gone there, he spoke to Khemaka as instructed: \"The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. Do you, venerable Khemaka, regard any of these five aggregates as self or as belonging to self?\"\n\n\"Friend, the Blessed One has indeed spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. In these five aggregates, I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self,\" replied Khemaka.\n\nThen the venerable D\u0101saka returned to the elder bhikkhus and reported: \"Friend Khemaka said: 'The Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. In these five aggregates, I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self.'\"\n\nThe elders said: \"Come, friend D\u0101saka, go again to Khemaka and speak to him thus: 'The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. If you, venerable Khemaka, do not regard anything in these five aggregates as self or as belonging to self, then you are an arahant, one whose taints are exhausted.'\"\n\n\"Yes, friends,\" D\u0101saka replied to the elder bhikkhus and went again to Khemaka. Having gone there, he spoke to Khemaka as instructed: \"The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. If you, venerable Khemaka, do not regard anything in these five aggregates as self or as belonging to self, then you are an arahant, one whose taints are exhausted.\"\n\n\"Friend, the Blessed One has indeed spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. In these five aggregates, I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self, nor am I an arahant whose taints are exhausted. However, in these five aggregates, there remains the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency.\"\n\nThen the venerable D\u0101saka returned to the elder bhikkhus and reported: \"Friend Khemaka said: 'The Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate.

However, in these five aggregates, there remains the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency.'\"\n\nThe elders said: \"Come, friend D\u0101saka, go again to Khemaka and speak to him thus: 'The elders, friend Khemaka, ask: What do you mean by saying, 'I am'? Do you mean that form is 'I am,' or do you mean something other than form? Do you mean that feeling is 'I am,' or something other than feeling? Do you mean that perception is 'I am,' or something other than perception? Do you mean that formations are 'I am,' or something other than formations? Do you mean that consciousness is 'I am,' or something other than consciousness? What exactly do you mean by saying, 'I am'?\"\n\n\"Yes, friends,\" D\u0101saka replied to the elder bhikkhus and went again to Khemaka. Having gone there, he spoke to Khemaka as instructed: \"The elders, friend Khemaka, ask: What do you mean by saying, 'I am'? Do you mean that form is 'I am,' or do you mean something other than form? Do you mean that feeling is 'I am,' or something other than feeling? Do you mean that perception is 'I am,' or something other than perception? Do you mean that formations are 'I am,' or something other than formations? Do you mean that consciousness is 'I am,' or something other than consciousness? What exactly do you mean by saying, 'I am'?\"\n\n\"Enough, friend D\u0101saka, why this roundabout talk? Bring a staff; I will go to the elders myself,\" replied Khemaka.\n\nThen the venerable Khemaka took a staff and went to the elders. Having approached them, he exchanged greetings with the elder bhikkhus and, after a courteous conversation, sat down to one side.\n\nThe elder bhikkhus then asked him: \"What do you mean by saying, 'I am'? Do you mean that form is 'I am,' or do you mean something other than form? Do you mean that feeling is 'I am,' or something other than feeling? Do you mean that perception is 'I am,' or something other than perception? Do you mean that formations are 'I am,' or something other than formations? Do you mean that consciousness is 'I am,' or something other than consciousness? What exactly do you mean by saying, 'I am'?\"\n\n\"Friends, I do not say that form is 'I am,' nor that something other than form is 'I am.' I do not say that feeling is 'I am,' nor that something other than feeling is 'I am.' I do not say that perception is 'I am,' nor that something other than perception is 'I am.' I do not say that formations are 'I am,' nor that something other than formations is 'I am.' I do not say that consciousness is 'I am,' nor that something other than consciousness is 'I am.' However, in these five aggregates, there remains the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency.\"\n\n\"Friends, consider the scent of a lotus, water lily, or white lotus. If someone were to say, 'The scent belongs to the petals,' or 'The scent belongs to the color,' or 'The scent belongs to the stamens,' would they be correct?\"\n\n\"No, friend.\"\n\n\"Then, how, friend, would one rightly explain it?\"\n\n\"One would rightly explain, friend, 'It is the scent of the flower.'\"\n\n\"In the same way, friend, I do not say that form is 'I am,' nor do I say that something other than form is 'I am.' I do not say that feeling is 'I am,' nor that something other than feeling is 'I am.' I do not say that perception is 'I am,' nor that something other than perception is 'I am.' I do not say that formations are 'I am,' nor that something other than formations is 'I am.' I do not say that consciousness is 'I am,' nor that something other than consciousness is 'I am.' However, in these five aggregates subject to clinging, there remains the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency.\"\n\n\"Friend, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, still the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency remains. Over time, he contemplates the arising and passing away of the five aggregates: 'Such is form, such is the arising of form, such is the passing away of form; such is feeling, such is the arising of feeling, such is the passing away of feeling; such is perception, such is the arising of perception, such is the passing away of perception; such are formations, such is the arising of formations, such is the passing away of formations; such is consciousness, such is the arising of consciousness, such is the passing away of consciousness.' Contemplating thus, the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency is fully eradicated.\"\n\n\"Just as, friend, a cloth that is soiled and stained with dirt is given by its owners to a washer. The washer, having rubbed it with saline cleaning salt, lye, or cow dung, washes it clean in water. Even though the cloth becomes clean and bright, a residual odor of saline cleaning salt, lye, or cow dung may remain. The washer then returns the cloth to the owners, who store it in a fragrant box. Whatever residual odor remains, eventually, that too disappears.\"\n\n\"In the same way, friend, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, still the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency remains. Over time, he contemplates the arising and passing away of the five aggregates: 'Such is form, such is the arising of form, such is the passing away of form; such is feeling, such is the arising of feeling, such is the passing away of feeling; such is perception, such is the arising of perception, such is the passing away of perception; such are formations, such is the arising of formations, such is the passing away of formations; such is consciousness, such is the arising of consciousness, such is the passing away of consciousness.' Contemplating thus, the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency is fully eradicated.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus, the elder bhikkhus said to the venerable Khemaka: \"Friend Khemaka, we did not ask you these questions to trouble you, but because you are capable of explaining, teaching, establishing, revealing, analyzing, and elucidating the Blessed One's teaching in detail. And this, venerable Khemaka, you have done: you have explained, taught, established, revealed, analyzed, and elucidated the Blessed One's teaching in detail.\"\n\nThe venerable Khemaka spoke these words, and the elder bhikkhus rejoiced in the venerable Khemaka's words. As this discourse was being given, the minds of sixty elder bhikkhus were liberated from the taints without grasping, including that of the venerable Khemaka."}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:\n\n\"All is burning, bhikkhus. And what, bhikkhus, is all that is burning?\n\nThe eye, bhikkhus, is burning; forms are burning; eye-consciousness is burning; eye-contact is burning. Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? 'It is burning with the fire of passion (desire, attachment), with the fire of aversion (ill-will, hatred), with the fire of delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification); it is burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.\n\nThe ear is burning; sounds are burning; ear-consciousness is burning; ear-contact is burning. Whatever feeling arises with ear-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? 'It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of aversion, with the fire of delusion; it is burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.\n\nThe nose is burning; odors are burning; nose-consciousness is burning; nose-contact is burning. Whatever feeling arises with nose-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? 'It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of aversion, with the fire of delusion; it is burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.\n\nThe tongue is burning; tastes are burning; tongue-consciousness is burning; tongue-contact is burning. Whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? 'It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of aversion, with the fire of delusion; it is burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.\n\nThe body is burning; tactile sensations are burning; body-consciousness is burning; body-contact is burning. Whatever feeling arises with body-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? 'It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of aversion, with the fire of delusion; it is burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.\n\nThe mind is burning; mental phenomena (thoughts, emotions, memories, and perceptions) are burning; mind-consciousness is burning; mind-contact is burning. Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? 'It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of aversion, with the fire of delusion; it is burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.\n\nSeeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, with forms, with eye-consciousness, with eye-contact, and with whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant; with that too, he becomes disenchanted.\n\nWith that too, he becomes disenchanted regarding whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition \u2014 whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant.\n\nBecoming disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he liberated; when liberated, there is the insight: 'Liberated.'\n\nHe understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\"\n\nThis was said by the Blessed One. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in the Blessed One's words. And while this discourse was being given, the minds of the thousand bhikkhus were liberated from the taints through non-clinging."}

Then D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u, a young Koliyan man, approached the Blessed One. Having approached and paid respects to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Sitting down to one side, D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u, the young Koliyan man, said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, we are householders who enjoy sensual pleasures live with children around us. We use sandalwood from K\u0101si, wear garlands, perfumes, and ointments, and enjoy gold and money. Therefore, venerable sir, may the Blessed One teach us the Dhamma in such a way that it will lead to our benefit and happiness in this life and in the future life.\"\n\n### Benefit and Happiness in This Life\n\n\"Byagghapajja (epithet of the Koliyans), there are these four qualities that lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of good family in this life. What are these four?\n\nAccomplishment in initiative, accomplishment in protection, good friendship, and balanced livelihood.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in initiative? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family supports his livelihood through various occupations - whether by farming, trading, cow herding, archery, government service, serving the king, or other crafts. He is skillful and not lazy, endowed with investigation and examination, capable of completing and organizing. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in initiative.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in protection? Here, Byagghapajja, the wealth of a son of good family is acquired through initiative and persistence, accumulated through the strength of arms, earned by sweat, righteous and lawfully obtained. He maintains this wealth with protection and guarding, thinking: 'How can my wealth not be seized by authorities, not stolen by thieves, not burned by fire, not carried away by water, and not seized by unfriendly heirs?' This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in protection.\n\nWhat, Byagghapajja, is good friendship? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family, wherever he lives, whether in a village or a town, there, he should associate with householders or their sons, whether young or old with moral virtue, whether endowed with faith, virtue, generosity, and wisdom. He should stand with them, converse with them, and engage in discussions with them. He should emulate the faith of those endowed with faith, the virtue of those endowed with virtue, the generosity of those endowed with generosity, and the wisdom of those endowed with wisdom. This, Byagghapajja, is called good friendship.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is balanced livelihood? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family, knowing both his income and his expenses, sustains a balanced livelihood, neither overly extravagant nor too frugal: 'Thus my income will cover my expenses, and my expenses will not exceed my income.' Just as, Byagghapajja, a scale holder or a scale holder's apprentice, having taken up the scale, knows: 'It is lowered by this much, or it is raised by this much, in the same way, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family, knowing both his income and his expenses, sustains a balanced livelihood, neither overly extravagant nor too frugal: 'Thus my income will cover my expenses, and my expenses will not exceed my income.' If, Byagghapajja, this son of a good family, having a small income, lives extravagantly, people will say: 'This son of a good family devours his wealth like a fig tree parasite.' If, Byagghapajja, this son of a good family, having a large income, lives miserably, people will say: 'This son of a good family will die without enjoying his wealth, like one who dies of hunger despite having plenty.' But when, Byagghapajja, this son of a good family, knowing both his income and his expenses, sustains a balanced livelihood, neither overly extravagant nor too frugal: 'Thus my income will cover my expenses, and my expenses will not exceed my income.' This, Byagghapajja, is called balanced livelihood.\n\nThus, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four drains: being promiscuous, a drunkard, a gambler, and associating with bad friends, bad companions, and being influenced by bad people. Just as, Byagghapajja, a large pond has four inlets and four drains, if a person would block the inlets and open the drains; and if the rain does not fall properly, then, Byagghapajja, for that large pond, only decline can be expected, not growth; in the same way, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four drains: being a womanizer, a drunkard, a gambler, and associating with bad friends, bad companions, and being influenced by bad people.\n\n### Benefit and Happiness in the Future Life\n\nThus, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four inlets: not being a womanizer, not being a drunkard, not being a gambler, and having good friends, good companions, and being influenced by good people. Just as, Byagghapajja, a large pond has four inlets and four drains, if a person were to open the inlets and block the drains, and if the rain falls properly, then, Byagghapajja, for that large pond, growth can be expected, not decline; in the same way, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four inlets: not being a womanizer, not being a drunkard, not being a gambler, and having good friends, good companions, and being influenced by good people.\n\nIndeed, Byagghapajja, these four qualities lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of a good family in this life.\n\nByagghapajja, there are these four qualities that lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of a good family in the future life. Which four? Accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in ethical conduct, accomplishment in generosity, accomplishment in wisdom.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in faith? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family is endowed with faith, and has faith in the enlightenment of the Tath\u0101gata: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant and perfectly awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide for trainable individuals, a teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in faith.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in ethical conduct? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family refrains from killing living beings, refrains from taking what is not given, refrains from sexual misconduct, refrains from false speech, and refrains from intoxicants leading to heedlessness. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in ethical conduct.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in generosity? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family lives at home with a mind free from the stain of stinginess, generous, open handed, enjoying relinquishment, responsive to requests, and joyful in sharing gifts. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in generosity.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in wisdom? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family is wise, endowed with wisdom that discerns the arising and passing away (of phenomena), which is noble and penetrative, leading to the complete ending of discontentment. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in wisdom.\n\nIndeed, Byagghapajja, these four qualities lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of a good family in the future life.\n\n### Verse\n\nIndustrious in one's duties,\ndiligent and skillful;\nOne sustains a balanced livelihood\nand protects what is acquired.\n\nFaithful, endowed with virtue,\ngenerous and free from stinginess;\nAlways purifying the path,\nensuring safety in the future life.\n\nThus these eight qualities,\nfor the faithful householder;\nAre explained by the one who is truly named,\nto bring happiness in both respects.\n\nFor the benefit in this life,\nand for happiness in the future life;\nThis is how for a householder,\nmerit grows by generosity."}

It has eight parts below well-fixed, and eight parts above. If strong wind and rain were to come from the east, it would neither shake nor tremble; if strong wind and rain were to come from the west, from the north, from the south, it would neither shake nor tremble. And why is that? Because of the depth and the well-planted nature of the stone pillar.

Then the venerable S\u0101riputta approached the Blessed One, paid respects, and sat down to one side. Sitting there, the venerable S\u0101riputta said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin more superior in direct knowledge than the Blessed One in full awakening.\"\n\n\"Truly remarkable, S\u0101riputta! You have spoken exalted speech, declared an absolute truth, and roared a lion's roar: 'Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin who is superior in direct knowledge than the Blessed One in full awakening.'\n\nWhat about those who were fully enlightened ones in past times, S\u0101riputta? Did you know all those blessed ones by encompassing their minds with your mind: 'Such was their virtue, such was their teaching, such was their wisdom, such was their conduct, such was their liberation'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What about those who will be fully enlightened ones in future times, S\u0101riputta? Will you know all those blessed ones by encompassing their minds with your mind: 'Such will be their virtue, such will be their teaching, such will be their wisdom, such will be their conduct, such will be their liberation'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What about me, S\u0101riputta, now, the fully enlightened one? Am I known to you by having encompassed my mind with your mind: 'Such is my virtue, such is my teaching, such is my wisdom, such is my conduct, such is my liberation'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And in this case, S\u0101riputta, regarding the past, future, and present fully enlightened ones, you have no mental knowledge. Then what about the exalted speech that has been spoken, the absolute truth that has been taken, the lion's roar that has been uttered: 'Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin superior in direct knowledge to the Blessed One in full awakening'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir, I have no mental knowledge regarding the past, future, and present fully enlightened ones, but I have discerned the principle through the Dhamma. Just as, venerable sir, in a border city of the king, well fortified with strong walls and gates, with one gate, there the gatekeeper is wise, competent, and intelligent. He prevents strangers and admits acquaintances. Walking around the city, he does not see any gap or opening in the wall, not even a hole for a cat to get through. He thinks: 'Whatever large creatures enter or exit this city, all of them do so through this gate.'\"\n\n\"Just so, venerable sir, it is known to me by the principle: 'Those who were fully enlightened ones in the past, all those blessed ones, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. Those who will be fully enlightened ones in the future, all those blessed ones, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, will fully awaken to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. The Blessed One also, now, the fully enlightened one, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with mind well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, has fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.'\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent, S\u0101riputta. Therefore, you should frequently speak this teaching to the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen. For, S\u0101riputta, if there are any misguided persons who have doubts or uncertainties about the Tath\u0101gata, upon hearing this discourse, their doubts and uncertainties about the Tath\u0101gata will be dispelled.\""}

Indeed, there are eighteen ways of craving pertaining to the internal bases, and eighteen ways of craving pertaining to the external bases.\n\nWhat are these eighteen ways of craving pertaining to the internal bases? When there is the notion 'I am' bhikkhus, there are the notions 'I am thus'; 'I am like this'; 'I am otherwise (different)'; 'I am everlasting'; 'I truly exist'; 'There exists'; 'It is thus'; 'It is like this'; 'It is otherwise (different)'; 'May I exist'; 'May I be thus'; 'May I be like this'; 'May I be otherwise (different)'; 'I will be'; 'I will be thus'; 'I will be like this'; 'I will be otherwise (different)'.

These are the eighteen ways of craving pertaining to the external bases.\n\nThus, there are eighteen ways of craving related to internal bases, and eighteen ways of craving related to external bases. These, bhikkhus, are called the thirty-six ways of craving. Thus, such thirty-six ways of craving have been in the past, thirty-six ways of craving will be in the future, and thirty-six ways of craving are present now. In this way, there exist one hundred and eight ways of craving.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is that craving which is entangling, flowing, spreading, and ensnaring, through which this world is upturned, completely enveloped, tangled like a ball of thread, knotted up, and entangled like a grass mat, leading to misery, bad states, downfall, and does not transcend the cycle of existence."}

Thereupon, the Blessed One, together with several bhikkhus, approached the Inspiration Peak.\n\nThere, a certain bhikkhu saw a great precipice at the Inspiration Peak and, having seen it, said to the Blessed One, \"This, venerable sir, is a great precipice, truly frightening, venerable sir.

They do not escape from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. I say, 'They do not escape from suffering.'\n\nAnd those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it truly is, 'This is suffering,' who understand as it truly is, 'This is the origin of suffering,' who understand as it truly is, 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and who understand as it truly is, 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,' they do not delight in volitional formations leading to rebirth, aging, death, and sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.

They escape from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" responded the bhikkhus to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then spoke:\n\n\"Once, bhikkhus, I was dwelling near Uruvel\u0101, on the bank of the Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 River, at the foot of the Ajap\u0101la banyan tree. There, having just attained enlightenment and being in solitude, a reflection arose in my mind: 'Indeed, living without respect and guidance results in suffering. What if I were to honor and rely upon an ascetic or a brahmin?'\n\nIt then occurred to me, bhikkhus: 'I should only rely on another ascetic or brahmin to complete what is lacking in my aggregate of virtue. However, I see no one in the world with its devas, M\u0101ras, and Brahmas, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, devas and humans, who possesses virtue superior to my own, to whom I could look up for respect and guidance.\n\nIn the same way, I should only depend on another ascetic or brahmin to fulfill what is lacking in my collectedness aggregate. But, I see no one in the world who surpasses my own collectedness.\n\nLikewise, to complete what is lacking in my wisdom aggregate, I would depend on another ascetic or brahmin. However, I see no one in the world who surpasses my own wisdom.\n\nFurthermore, to complete what is lacking in my liberation aggregate, I would depend on another ascetic or brahmin. Yet, I see no one in the world who possesses liberation greater than mine.\n\nThus, I considered: 'Why not honor and depend on this Dhamma that I have fully realized?'\n\nThen, bhikkhus, Brahm\u0101 Sahampati, perceiving the deliberations of my mind, as easily as a strong man might stretch out or withdraw his arm, appeared before me from the Brahma-world. Brahm\u0101 Sahampati, draping his outer robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, placed his hands together towards me, and said: 'So it is, Blessed One, so it is, Well-Gone One. Just as the past Fully Enlightened Ones honored and depended on the Dhamma, and as future Fully Enlightened Ones will do, so too should you, currently the Blessed One, the Fully Enlightened One, honor and depend on the Dhamma.'\n\nAfter speaking, Brahm\u0101 Sahampati continued:\n\n'The Buddhas of the past,\nAnd those yet to arise,\nAs well as the present Buddha,\nAll dispellers of sorrow.\n\nAll have revered the true Dhamma,\nThey lived, they live,\nand they will live [in future] thus;\nThis is the nature of the Buddhas.\n\nTherefore, those who desire their own benefit (self-liberation),\nAspiring for excellence;\nShould revere the Dhamma,\nFollowing the Buddha's teachings.'\n\nHaving spoken these words, bhikkhus, Brahm\u0101 Sahampati paid homage to me, circumambulated me with his right side towards me, and then disappeared. Thereafter, recognizing Brahm\u0101's request and what was appropriate for myself, I honored and relied upon the Dhamma that I had fully comprehended and lived accordingly. And as the Sangha was also endowed with excellence, respect grew within the Sangha.\""}

When this was said, the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Akkosaka Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja:\n\n\"What do you think, brahmin, do friends, colleagues, relatives, and guests come to you?\"\n\n\"On some occasions, sir Gotama, friends, colleagues, relatives, and guests come to me.\"\n\n\"What do you think, brahmin, do you offer them food, meals, or bedding?\"\n\n\"On some occasions, sir Gotama, I offer them food, meals, or bedding.\"\n\n\"But if they do not accept it, Brahmin, to whom does it belong?\"\n\n\"If they do not accept it, sir Gotama, it belongs to us only.\"\n\n\"Even so, Brahmin, what you have insulted us with, who do not insult, who are not angry, who do not quarrel, we do not accept it. It belongs to you, Brahmin, it is yours alone.\n\nWhoever insults back an insulting person, gets angry at an angry person, quarrels with a quarreling person, is said, Brahmin, to partake and carry on the quarrel. But we neither partake nor carry it on with you. It belongs to you, Brahmin, it is yours alone.\"\n\n\"Indeed, the assembly including the king knows Gotama as the worthy ascetic. Yet however, the Blessed One Gotama is angry.\"\n\n\"How can there be anger in one without anger,\nin one who is disciplined and lives in harmony?\nIn one with true knowledge, liberated,\ncalm, and steadfast.\n\nIt is worse for the one,\nwho retaliates against the angry one;\nNot retaliating against the angry,\none wins a battle hard to win.\n\nHe acts for the benefit of both,\nof himself and the other;\nKnowing the other is agitated,\nthe mindful one calms down.\n\nThose who heal both,\nthemselves and the other;\nare thought foolish by people,\nwho are unskilled in the teachings.\"\n\nWhen this was said, the brahmin Akkosaka Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja said to the Blessed One: \"Excellent, sir Gotama... I go for refuge to the Blessed One Gotama, to the teachings of the Blessed One (Dhamma), and to the community of bhikkhus. May I receive the ordination in the presence of the Blessed One Gotama, may I receive the full ordination.\"\n\nThe brahmin Akkosaka Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja received the ordination in the presence of the Blessed One, he received the full ordination. Having recently received full ordination, the venerable Akkosaka Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute, soon realized with direct knowledge in this very life, for the purpose of which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life to the homeless life, the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life, having personally attained it, he dwelled.\n\nHe understood: \"Ended is birth, lived is the spiritual life, done is the task, there is no more of this state of existence.\" And the venerable Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja became one among the arahants."}

After their cordial and meaningful conversation had concluded, he sat to one side. Seated to one side, the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One:\n\n### Speculative Views\n\n\"Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'the world is eternal, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'the world is eternal, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'the world is not eternal, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'the world is not eternal, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Is it then, Venerable Gotama, your view that 'the world is finite, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'the world is finite, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'the world is infinite, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'the world is infinite, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'the soul and the body are the same, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'the soul and the body are the same, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'the soul is one thing and the body another, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'the soul is one thing and the body another, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'a Tath\u0101gata exists after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'a Tath\u0101gata exists after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'a Tath\u0101gata does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'a Tath\u0101gata does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Is it then, Venerable Gotama, your view that 'a Tath\u0101gata both exists and does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'a Tath\u0101gata both exists and does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, is it your view that 'a Tath\u0101gata neither exists nor does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'?\"\n\n\"It is not my view, Vaccha, that 'a Tath\u0101gata neither exists nor does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless'.\"\n\n\"When asked this 'Venerable Gotama, is it your view that the world is eternal, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless?', you replied, 'It is not my view, Vaccha, that the world is eternal, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless.' ... 'Then, Venerable Gotama, is it your view that a Tath\u0101gata neither exists nor does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless?' When asked this, you replied, 'It is not my view, Vaccha, that a Tath\u0101gata neither exists nor does not exist after death, this alone is true, anything else is meaningless.' What danger do you see, Venerable Gotama, that leads you to avoid all these speculative views?\"\n\nVaccha, the view 'the world is eternal' is a view, a tangle of views, a thicket of views, a distortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. It is accompanied by suffering, distress, despair, and fever, and does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, tranquility, higher knowledge, awakening, or Nibb\u0101na. The view 'the world is not eternal' ... The view 'the world is finite' ... The view 'the world is infinite' ... The view 'the soul and the body are the same' ... The view 'the soul is one thing and the body is another' ... The view 'the Tath\u0101gata exists after death' ... The view 'the Tath\u0101gata does not exist after death' ... The view 'the Tath\u0101gata both exists and does not exist after death' ... The view 'the Tath\u0101gata neither exists nor does not exist after death' is a view, a tangle of views, a thicket of views, a distortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. It is accompanied by suffering, distress, despair, and feverishness, and does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, tranquility, higher knowledge, awakening, or Nibb\u0101na. Seeing this danger, Vaccha, I do not take up any of these views.\n\n### Going Beyond Speculative Views\n\n\"Is there any speculative view that the Venerabel Gotama holds?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'speculative view' is something the Tath\u0101gata has gone beyond. The Tath\u0101gata sees this: 'Such is form, its arising, its passing away; such is feeling, its arising, its passing away; such is perception, its arising, its passing away; such are volitional formations, their arising, their passing away; such is consciousness, its arising, its passing away.' Therefore, I say, the Tath\u0101gata, through giving up of all conceptions, all mental disturbance, all I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendencies to conceit and through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, relinquishment, is liberated without clinging.\"\n\n\"Being thus liberated, Venerable Gotama, where does a bhikkhu reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'reappear' does not apply.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, does he not reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'does not reappear' also does not apply.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, does he both reappear and not reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, does he neither reappear nor not reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\n\"When asked, 'Being thus liberated in mind, Venerable Gotama, where does a bhikkhu reappear?' you replied, 'Vaccha, 'reappears' does not apply.' When further asked, 'Then, does he not reappear?' you replied, 'Vaccha, 'does not reappear' does not apply.' When further asked if 'he both reappears and does not reappear,' you stated, 'Vaccha, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply.' And when asked whether 'he neither reappears nor does not reappear,' you replied, 'Vaccha, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.' At this, I have fallen into confusion, Venerable Gotama. Even the slight confidence I had from our earlier conversation has now disappeared.\"\n\n\"It is fitting for you, Vaccha, to be confused. This Dhamma, Vaccha, is profound, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, understandable only by the wise. It is difficult for you to understand this, being of another view, another faith, another inclination, following a different teacher.\n\nSo, Vaccha, let me question you instead; answer as you see fit.\n\n### Simile of Fire\n\nWhat do you think, Vaccha, if a fire were burning in front of you, would you know, 'This fire is burning in front of me'?\"\n\n\"If there were a fire burning in front of me, Venerable Gotama, I would know, 'This fire is burning in front of me.'\"\n\n\"And if someone were to ask you, 'This fire burning in front of you, on what does it depend?' how would you answer?\"\n\n\"If, Venerable Gotama, you were to ask me thus:\n\n'This fire burning before you, on what does it depend to burn?' thus questioned, I, Venerable Gotama, would answer: 'This fire burning before me depends on grass and wood as fuel to burn.'\"\n\n\"If that fire in front of you were to be extinguished, Vaccha, would you know, 'This fire in front of me has been extinguished'?\"\n\n\"If that fire in front of me were to be extinguished, Venerable Gotama, I would know, 'This fire in front of me has been extinguished.'\"\n\n\"And if someone were to ask you, 'This fire that has been extinguished, in which direction has it gone \u2014 east, south, west, or north?' how would you respond?\"\n\n\"It does not apply, Venerable Gotama. For that fire, having burned dependent on grass and wood for fuel, being consumed, and not being offered any more fuel, is said to be extinguished.\"\n\n### Freed from Classification\n\n\"In the same way, Vaccha, whatever form by which one might define the Tath\u0101gata, that form has been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by form, Vaccha, the Tath\u0101gata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\nWhatever feeling by which one might designate the Tath\u0101gata, that feeling has been abandoned by the Tath\u0101gata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so it is no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by feeling, Vaccha, the Tath\u0101gata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply. Whatever perception by which one might designate the Tath\u0101gata, that perception has been abandoned by the Tath\u0101gata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so it is no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by perception, Vaccha, the Tath\u0101gata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply. Whatever volitional formations by which one might designate the Tath\u0101gata, those volitional formations have been abandoned by the Tath\u0101gata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so they are no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by volitional formations, Vaccha, the Tath\u0101gata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply. Whatever consciousness by which one might designate the Tath\u0101gata, that consciousness has been abandoned by the Tath\u0101gata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so it is no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by consciousness, Vaccha, the Tath\u0101gata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\nAfter these words were spoken, the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Just as, Venerable Gotama, near a village or town, there stands a great sal tree. Its branches and leaves fall off, its bark peels away, and its sapwood disintegrates. In time, it stands clean, devoid of branches, bark, and sapwood, established in its heartwood. Similarly, the teaching of Venerable Gotama stands purified, free of branches, bark, and sapwood, established in its essence.\n\nMarvelous, Venerable Gotama! Allow me to take refuge in Venerable Gotama from this day forth as long as life lasts, having gone to him for refuge.\""}

Then S\u0101\u1e37ha, Mig\u0101ra's grandson, and S\u0101\u1e47o, Sekhuniya's grandson, approached the venerable Nandaka. Having approached, they paid homage to the venerable Nandaka and sat down to one side. While seated to one side, the venerable Nandaka said to S\u0101\u1e37ha, Mig\u0101ra's grandson:\n\n\"Come now, S\u0101\u1e37ha, do not [adhere merely] by tradition, by lineage, by rumor, by scripture, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by speculative reasoning, by acceptance of a view after thorough investigation, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because 'the ascetic is our revered teacher.' When you know for yourselves: 'These mental qualities are unwholesome; these mental qualities are blameworthy; these mental qualities are criticized by the wise; these mental qualities, when adopted and carried out, lead to harm and to suffering (discontentment, stress),' then you should abandon them.\n\nWhat do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, is there greed (passion, lust, desire, attachment)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means covetousness (wishing for/wanting/longing for with strong eagerness, yearning). Indeed, this covetous person, being greedy, might kill living beings, take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lie, and persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, is there aversion (hate, anger, resentment)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means ill-will. Indeed, this person filled with ill-will might kill living beings, take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lie, and persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, is there delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means ignorance (misapprehension of true reality). Indeed, this deluded person might kill living beings, take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lie, and persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, are these mental qualities wholesome or unwholesome?\"\n\n\"Unwholesome, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Blameworthy or blameless?\"\n\n\"Blameworthy, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?\"\n\n\"Criticized by the wise, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Do they, when adopted and carried out, lead to harm and to suffering, or not? How does it stand with that?\"\n\n\"They lead to harm and to suffering, venerable sir. That is how it stands.\"\n\n\"So, S\u0101\u1e37ha, as we said: 'Come now, S\u0101\u1e37ha, do not [adhere merely] by hearsay... When you know for yourselves \u2014 these mental qualities are unwholesome, blameworthy, criticized by the wise, and, when adopted and carried out, lead to harm and to suffering, then you should abandon them.' Thus was it said, and this was the reason for saying it.\n\nCome now, S\u0101\u1e37ha, do not [adhere merely] by hearsay... When you know for yourselves: 'These mental qualities are wholesome, blameless, praised by the wise, and, when adopted and carried out, lead to welfare and to ease (bliss),' then you should practice and abide in them.\n\nWhat do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, is there non-greed?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means contentment. Indeed, this contented person does not kill living beings, does not take what is not given, does not engage in sexual misconduct, does not lie, and does not persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term welfare and ease (bliss).\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, is there non-aversion?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means good-will. Indeed, this person free from ill-will does not kill living beings, does not take what is not given, does not engage in sexual misconduct, does not lie, and does not persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term welfare and ease (bliss).\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, is there non-delusion (presence of close examination and verification, due consideration)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means knowing (clear apprehension of how things have come to be). Indeed, this wise person does not kill living beings, does not take what is not given, does not engage in sexual misconduct, does not lie, and does not persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term welfare and ease (bliss).\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, S\u0101\u1e37ha, are these mental qualities wholesome or unwholesome?\"\n\n\"Wholesome, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Blameworthy or blameless?\"\n\n\"Blameless, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?\"\n\n\"Praised by the wise, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Do they, when adopted and carried out, lead to welfare and to ease (bliss), or not? How does it stand with that?\"\n\n\"They lead to welfare and to ease (bliss), venerable sir. That is how it stands.\"\n\n\"So, S\u0101\u1e37ha, as we said: 'Come now, S\u0101\u1e37ha, do not [adhere merely] by hearsay... When you know for yourselves \u2014\n\nthese mental qualities are wholesome, blameless, praised by the wise, and, when adopted and carried out, lead to long-term welfare and ease (bliss), then you should practice and abide in them.' Thus was it said, and this was the reason for saying it.\n\n\"Thus, S\u0101\u1e37ha, the noble disciple, having abandoned covetousness, ill-will, and delusion, being aware and mindful, dwells pervading one direction with a heart imbued with loving-kindness (good-will), similarly the second, similarly the third, similarly the fourth; thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a heart imbued with loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity, extensive, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill-will.\n\nHe thus understands: 'There is this, there is the inferior, there is the superior, and beyond this is liberation from the sphere of perception.' As he understands and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, from the taint of ignorance; in liberation, there arises the knowledge: 'It is liberated.'\n\n'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being,' he understands.\n\nThus he understands: 'Previously there was greed, which was unwholesome; now it is not present, thus it is wholesome; previously there was aversion... previously there was delusion, which was unwholesome; now it is not present, thus it is wholesome.'

This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the noble place, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets in motion the spiritual teaching.\n\nFurther, again, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata sees beings passing away and arising, with his divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision. He knows beings as lowly or exalted, beautiful or ugly, fortunate or unfortunate, according to their actions. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the noble place, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets in motion the spiritual teaching.\n\nFurther, again, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata dwells having personally realized with direct knowledge the wearing away of the taints, experiencing the liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, in the visible state. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the noble place, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets in motion the spiritual teaching. Bhikkhus, these are the six Tath\u0101gata powers, endowed with which the Tath\u0101gata claims the noble place, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets in motion the spiritual teaching.\n\nIf others, bhikkhus, approach the Tath\u0101gata and question him about what is possible and what is impossible as it actually is, with the knowledge that the Tath\u0101gata possesses, the Tath\u0101gata will answer accordingly. Just as, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata knows, as it actually is, what is possible and what is impossible, so too does the Tath\u0101gata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nIf others, bhikkhus, approach the Tath\u0101gata and question him about the results of actions performed in the past, future, and present according to their causes and conditions as they actually are, with the knowledge that the Tath\u0101gata possesses, the Tath\u0101gata will answer accordingly. Just as, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata knows, as it actually is, the results of actions in the past, future, and present according to their causes and conditions, so too does the Tath\u0101gata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nIf others, bhikkhus, approach the Tath\u0101gata and question him about the defilement, purification, and emergence of jh\u0101nas, liberations, and sam\u0101dhi attainments as they actually are, with the knowledge that the Tath\u0101gata possesses, the Tath\u0101gata will answer accordingly. Just as, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata knows, as it actually is, the defilement, purification, and emergence of jh\u0101nas, liberations, and sam\u0101dhi attainments, so too does the Tath\u0101gata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nIf others, bhikkhus, approach the Tath\u0101gata and question him about his manifold past lives in detail as he actually recollects them, with the knowledge that the Tath\u0101gata possesses, the Tath\u0101gata will answer accordingly. Just as, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata knows, as he actually recollects, his manifold past lives, so too does the Tath\u0101gata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nIf others, bhikkhus, approach the Tath\u0101gata and question him about beings passing away and arising with his divine eye, as he actually sees them, with the knowledge that the Tath\u0101gata possesses, the Tath\u0101gata will answer accordingly. Just as, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata knows, as it actually is, beings passing away and arising, so too does the Tath\u0101gata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nIf others, bhikkhus, approach the Tath\u0101gata and question him about the wearing away of the taints, as he actually knows and has realized it, with the knowledge that the Tath\u0101gata possesses, the Tath\u0101gata will answer accordingly. Just as, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata knows, as it actually is, the wearing away of the taints, so too does the Tath\u0101gata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, I declare that knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of the results of actions in the past, future, and present, according to their causes and conditions, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of the defilement, purification, and emergence of jh\u0101nas, liberations, and sam\u0101dhi attainments, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of manifold past lives, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of beings passing away and arising, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of the wearing away of the taints, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, collectedness is the path; non-collectedness is the wrong path.\""}

When discussions of faith occur, the faithless person clings, becomes angry, upset, resists strongly, and displays anger, aversion, and disapproval. Why is this so? It is because they do not see nor possess the accomplishment of faith within themselves, which is why they do not experience joy or delight from it. Therefore, for the faithless, talk of faith is difficult.\n\nAnd why, bhikkhus, is talk of morality a difficult topic for the immoral? An immoral person, when morality is being discussed, clings, becomes angry, upset, resists strongly, and displays anger, aversion, and disapproval. What is the reason for this? Indeed, they do not see or possess the accomplishment of morality within themselves, nor do they derive any joy or delight from it. Therefore, for the immoral, talk of morality is difficult.\n\nAnd why, bhikkhus, is talk of much learning a difficult topic for the less learned? A less learned person, when discussions of extensive scholarship are taking place, clings, becomes angry, upset, resists strongly, and displays anger, aversion, and disapproval.

A stingy person, when discussions of generosity are taking place, clings, becomes angry, upset, resists strongly, and displays anger, aversion, and disapproval. What is the reason for this? Indeed, they do not see nor possess the wealth of generosity within themselves, nor do they derive any joy or delight from it.

A faithful person, when discussions of faith are taking place, does not cling, does not become angry, upset, does not resist strongly, nor displays anger, aversion, or disapproval. What is the reason for this? Indeed, they see and possess the wealth of faith within themselves, and from that cause, they derive joy and delight. Therefore, for the faithful, talk of faith is pleasant.\n\nAnd why, bhikkhus, is talk of morality a pleasant topic for the virtuous? A virtuous person, when discussions of morality are taking place, does not cling, does not become angry, upset, does not resist strongly, nor displays anger, aversion, or disapproval.

To what extent, venerable sir, is one called a being?\"\n\nThe Blessed One replied, \"R\u0101dha, in form, wherever there is desire, passion, delight, and craving, there one is a being, there one is bound, therefore, one is called a being. In feeling, wherever there is desire, passion, delight, and craving, there one is a being, there one is bound, therefore, one is called a being. In perception, wherever there is desire, passion, delight, and craving, there one is a being, there one is bound, therefore, one is called a being. In formations, wherever there is desire, passion, delight, and craving, there one is a being, there one is bound, therefore, one is called a being. In consciousness, wherever there is desire, passion, delight, and craving, there one is a being, there one is bound, therefore, one is called a being.\n\nJust as, R\u0101dha, young boys or girls play with sandcastles: as long as they possess passion, desire, affection, thirst, fervor, and craving for those sandcastles, they cling to them, engage playfully, hold them dear, and consider them as their own. But when, R\u0101dha, the young boys or girls lose their passion, desire, affection, thirst, fervor, and craving towards those sandcastles, then they scatter them with their hands and feet, demolish and destroy them, rendering them unplayable.\"\n\nIn just this way, R\u0101dha, you too should scatter, demolish, and destroy form, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving. You should scatter, demolish, and destroy feeling, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving. You should scatter, demolish, and destroy perception, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving. You should scatter, demolish, and destroy volitional formations, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving. You should scatter, demolish, and destroy consciousness, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving. Indeed, R\u0101dha, the complete wearing away of craving is Nibb\u0101na.\""}

At that time, Vis\u0101kh\u0101's (Mig\u0101ra's mother) pleasing and beloved granddaughter had passed away. Then, Vis\u0101kh\u0101, with wet clothes and hair, approached the Blessed One during the day; having approached, she paid respects to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While she was sitting to one side, the Blessed One addressed her:\n\n\"Vis\u0101kh\u0101, where have you come from, arriving here during the day with wet clothes and hair?\" \n\n\"My granddaughter, who was dear and pleasing to me, has passed away, venerable sir. That is why I have come here during the day with wet clothes and hair.\"\n\n\"Would you, Vis\u0101kh\u0101, wish to have as many sons and grandsons as there are people in S\u0101vatthi?\"\n\n\"I would, Blessed One, wish to have as many sons and grandsons as there are people in S\u0101vatthi.\"\n\n\"How many people die daily in S\u0101vatthi, Vis\u0101kh\u0101?\"\n\n\"Ten even, venerable sir, people in S\u0101vatthi die daily; nine even, venerable sir; eight even, venerable sir; seven even, venerable sir; six even, venerable sir; five even, venerable sir; four even, venerable sir; three even, venerable sir; two even, venerable sir; one even, venerable sir. S\u0101vatthi is never free from people dying, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Vis\u0101kh\u0101, would you ever be without wet clothes and hair?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir. It is enough for me to have just a few sons and grandsons.\"\n\n\"Vis\u0101kh\u0101, for those who have a hundred dear ones, they have a hundred sufferings; for those who have ninety dear ones, they have ninety sufferings; for those who have eighty dear ones, they have eighty sufferings; for those who have seventy dear ones, they have seventy sufferings; for those who have sixty dear ones, they have sixty sufferings; for those who have fifty dear ones, they have fifty sufferings; for those who have forty dear ones, they have forty sufferings; for those who have thirty dear ones, they have thirty sufferings; for those who have twenty dear ones, they have twenty sufferings; for those who have ten dear ones, they have ten sufferings; for those who have nine dear ones, they have nine sufferings; for those who have eight dear ones, they have eight sufferings; for those who have seven dear ones, they have seven sufferings; for those who have six dear ones, they have six sufferings; for those who have five dear ones, they have five sufferings; for those who have four dear ones, they have four sufferings; for those who have three dear ones, they have three sufferings; for those who have two dear ones, they have two sufferings; for those who have one dear one, they have one suffering; for those who have no dear one, they have no suffering. They are sorrow-free, untainted, and unafflicted, I say.\"\n\nThen, knowing the significance of that moment, the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:\n\n\"Whatever sorrows and lamentations there are,\nvarious kinds of suffering in the world;\nthese arise because of what is dear,\nwithout what is dear, they do not occur.\n\nTherefore, those who are free from attachment,\nwho have no dear ones anywhere in the world;\naspiring to be sorrow-free and untainted,\nshould not hold anything dear in the world.\""}

At one time, the Blessed One was residing in Kosambi at Ghosita's park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Is there a method, bhikkhus, by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, can understand: 'I am a trainee,' and an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, can understand: 'I am an arahant'?\"\n\nThe bhikkhus replied, \"Our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, venerable sir, guided by the Blessed One, and have the Blessed One as their refuge. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One himself would clarify the meaning of this statement.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said: \"There is indeed a method, bhikkhus, by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, can understand: 'I am a trainee,' and an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, can understand: 'I am an arahant'.\n\nWhat is the method, bhikkhus, by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee'? Here, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu understands as it truly is: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.' This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee.'\n\nFurthermore, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu reflects thus: 'Is there any other ascetic or brahmin outside this teaching who teaches a doctrine so true and factual as the Blessed One?' He understands thus: 'There is no other ascetic or brahmin outside this teaching who teaches a doctrine so true and factual as the Blessed One.' This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee.'\"\n\nFurthermore, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu understands the five faculties: the faculty of confidence (faith), the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness (concentration), and the faculty of wisdom. He knows their tendencies, highest points, fruits, and final goals. He does not experience them with the body but sees them clearly with wisdom. This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee.'\n\nWhat is the method, bhikkhus, by which an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, understands: 'I am an arahant'? Here, bhikkhus, an arahant bhikkhu understands the five faculties: the faculty of confidence, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. He knows their tendencies, highest points, fruits, and final goals. He experiences them with the body and sees them clearly with wisdom. This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, understands: 'I am an arahant.'\n\nFurthermore, bhikkhus, an arahant bhikkhu understands the six faculties: the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty, and the mind faculty. He knows that these six faculties will cease entirely and no new faculties will arise anywhere. This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, understands: 'I am an arahant.'\""}

Attaman\u0101 te bhikkh\u016b bhagavato bh\u0101sita\u1e41 abhinandunti.", "output": "Thus have I heard \u2014 At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the Anga country, in a market town of the Angans called Assapura. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"People recognize you as 'ascetics, ascetics,' bhikkhus. But when asked 'Who are you?' you reply 'We are ascetics.'\n\n#### Training Guidelines\n\nFor you, bhikkhus, being recognized and acknowledging yourselves in this way, it should be understood that 'We will undertake and practice those things (dhammas) that lead to being an ascetic and a Brahmin, so that our recognition and acknowledgment will be true and factual. And for us, consuming the requisites such as robes, alms food, lodgings, and medical supplies, this conduct will bring great benefit and great merit, and our going forth will not be in vain but fruitful and successful.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, are the dhammas that lead to being an ascetic and a Brahmin? 'We will be endowed with shame and moral dread.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Conduct By Body, Speech, and Mind\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'Our bodily conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure bodily conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct is pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'Our verbal conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure verbal conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct and verbal conduct are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'Our mental conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure mental conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Livelihood\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'Our livelihood will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure livelihood, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, and livelihood are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Guarding the Sense Faculties\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will guard the doors of our sense faculties. Upon seeing a form with the eye, we will not grasp at its signs or features. Since if we left the eye faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade us, we will practice its restraint, guard the eye faculty, achieve restraint over the eye faculty. Upon hearing a sound with the ear ... upon smelling an odor with the nose ... upon tasting a flavor with the tongue ... upon touching a tangible with the body ... upon cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind, we will not grasp at its signs or features. Since if we left the mind faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade us, we will practice its restraint, guard the mind faculty, achieve restraint over the mind faculty.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, livelihood are pure, and we guard the doors of our sense faculties; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Moderation in Eating\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will be moderate in eating, reflecting wisely on the food we consume, not for fun, not for pleasure, not for fattening, not for beautification, but only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body, for keeping it healthy, for helping with the spiritual life, thinking thus: 'I will terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I will be healthy and blameless and live in comfort.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, livelihood are pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Wakefulness\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will be devoted to wakefulness. During the day, we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states. During the first watch of the night [dusk to 10 PM], we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states. During the middle watch of the night [10 PM to 2 AM], we will lie down on the right side in the posture of a lion, stacking one foot over the other, maintaining mindfulness and alertness, keeping in mind the intention to awaken (whether spontaneously or at a predetermined time). In the last watch of the night [2 AM to dawn], upon rising, we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think: 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct is pure, our verbal conduct is pure, our mental conduct is pure, our livelihood is pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Mindfulness and Full Awareness\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will be equipped with mindfulness and full awareness. When going forward and returning, we will act with full awareness. When looking ahead and looking away, we will act with full awareness. When flexing and extending our limbs, we will act with full awareness. In wearing our robes and carrying our outer robe and bowl, we will act with full awareness. When eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting, we will act with full awareness. In defecating and urinating, we will act with full awareness. When walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent, we will act with full awareness.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think: 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct is pure, our verbal conduct is pure, our mental conduct is pure, our livelihood is pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, equipped with mindfulness and full awareness; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells in a secluded lodging \u2014 in the forest, at the root of a tree, on a mountain, in a ravine, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest thicket, in the open air, on a heap of straw.\n\n#### Five Hindrances\n\nAfter the meal, having returned from alms-round, a bhikkhu sits down, crosses his legs, sets his body erect, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. He lives with a mind free from longing towards the world, purifying his mind from longing; he lives with a mind free from ill-will and hatred, feeling compassion for all living beings, purifying his mind from ill-will and hatred; he lives free from dullness and drowsiness (complacency), perceiving light, mindful and fully aware, purifying his mind from dullness and drowsiness; he lives free from restlessness and worry (mental agitation, anxiety), with an inwardly peaceful mind, purifying his mind from restlessness and worry; he lives free from doubt, having crossed over doubt, without doubting about wholesome states, purifying his mind from doubt.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, might take a loan to invest in a business. And that business succeeds. He would then repay his old debts and still have some profit left over for his family. He would think: 'Before, I took a loan to invest in a business, and that business succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and still have some profit left over for supporting my family.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, who was sick, in pain, and seriously ill, and his food did not nourish him, and his body had no strength. Then later on he recovers from that illness, his food nourishes him, and he regains strength in his body. He would think: 'Before, I was sick, in pain, and seriously ill, my food did not nourish me, and my body had no strength. Now, I have recovered from that illness, my food nourishes me, and I have regained strength in my body.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, who was imprisoned. Then later on he is released from prison, safe and secure, without any loss of his belongings. He would think: 'Before, I was imprisoned, now I have been released from prison, safe and secure, without any loss of my belongings.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, who was a slave, not free, dependent on others, unable to go where he wants. Then later on he is freed from slavery, becomes independent, not dependent on others, free to go where he wants. He would think: 'Before, I was a slave, not free, dependent on others, unable to go where I want. Now, I am freed from slavery, independent, not dependent on others, free to go where I want.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, with wealth and possessions would travel through a dangerous path. Then later on he gets through that dangerous path safely, securely, without any loss of his belongings. He would think: 'Before, with wealth and possessions, I traveled through a dangerous path. Now, I have gotten through that dangerous path safely, securely, without any loss of my belongings.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees these five hindrances in himself as if they were a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, a dangerous path. And when these five hindrances are abandoned, he sees himself as free from debt, healthy, released from prison, free from slavery, in a place of safety.\n\n#### Four Jh\u0101nas\n\n##### First Jh\u0101na\n\nHaving abandoned these five hindrances, impediments to the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jh\u0101na, which includes reflection and examination (of thoughts), with joyful pleasure born of seclusion. He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by the joyful pleasure born of seclusion. Just as a skilled bath man or his apprentice might knead water into bath powder so that the ball of bath powder is soaked and pervaded with moisture inside and out, yet does not drip.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by the joyful pleasure born of seclusion.\n\n##### Second Jh\u0101na\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, with the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jh\u0101na, which has internal tranquility and unification of mind, is without reflection or examination, and has joyful pleasure born of collectedness. He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of collectedness, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by joyful pleasure born of collectedness. Just as in a lake with spring water welling up from below, it would fill and overflow with cool water, so that there is no part of the lake not suffused by cool water.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with the joyful pleasure born of collectedness, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by joyful pleasure born of collectedness.\n\n##### Third Jh\u0101na\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, with the fading away of joyful pleasure, a bhikkhu dwells equanimous, mindful and fully aware, and experiences ease (bliss) with the body, which the noble ones describe as, 'one who dwells happily, equanimous, and at ease.' He enters and dwells in the third jh\u0101na. He permeates, pervades, fills, and suffuses this very body with ease devoid of delight, so that there is no part of his entire body that is not suffused with ease devoid of delight. Just as, bhikkhus, in a pond of blue, red, or white lotuses, some lotuses born in the water, grown in the water, and standing with their stalks immersed in the water, would be thoroughly permeated, pervaded, filled, and suffused from their tips to their roots with cool water, so that there is no part of the entire lotus that is not suffused with cool water.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu permeates, pervades, fills, and suffuses his entire body with ease devoid of delight, so that there is no part of his body that is not suffused with ease devoid of delight.\n\n##### Fourth Jh\u0101na\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, with the abandoning of both ease (bliss) and suffering (discontentment, stress), and with the previous disappearance of joy and sorrow, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensation, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jh\u0101na which is characterized by the purity of equanimity and mindfulness. He permeates, pervades, fills, and suffuses this very body with a pure, clear mind, so that there is no part of his entire body that is not suffused with a pure, clear mind. Just as, bhikkhus, a person covered from head to toe with a white cloth would have no part of his entire body uncovered by the white cloth.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sits pervading this very body with a pure mind, so purified and clarified, that there is no part of his whole body not pervaded by the pure mind.\n\n#### Three Knowledges\n\nThus with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births ... thus with their aspects and particulars, he recollects his manifold past lives. Just as a man might go from his own village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village return to his own village. He remembers, 'I went from my own village to that village, there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way; from that village I went to yet another village ... and from that village I have returned to my own.'\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives, with their aspects and particulars.\n\nThus, with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, malleable, flexible, suitable for use, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the passing away and reappearing of beings. With the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands beings according to their actions. Just as if there were two houses with doors, and a man with good eyesight standing between them could see people coming into and going out of the houses, walking around and roaming inside.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understands beings according to their actions.\n\nThus, with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the ending of the taints (source of defilements). He understands as it actually is, 'This is suffering,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the origin of suffering,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the cessation of suffering,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it actually is, 'These are the taints,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the origin of the taints,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the cessation of the taints,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the path leading to the cessation of the taints.' Knowing and seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, the taint of being, and the taint of ignorance. In liberation, there arises the knowledge: 'It is liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, in a mountain lake that is deep, clear and undisturbed, a person with good eyesight standing on the shore can see shells, gravel, pebbles, and also fish swimming about or resting, and it would occur to him, 'This mountain lake is deep, clear, and undisturbed. Here are these shells, gravel, pebbles, and also these fish swimming about or resting.'\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it actually is, 'This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, and this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering. These are the taints, this is the origin of the taints, this is the cessation of the taints, and this is the path leading to the cessation of the taints.' Understanding thus, he realizes, 'there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who is thus a 'ascetic', a 'brahmin', a 'bathed one', a 'knower of the vedas', a 'well-learned one', a 'noble one', an 'arahant'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'ascetic'? When he has calmed down evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'ascetic'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'brahmin'? When he has expelled evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'brahmin'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'bathed one'? When he has bathed away evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'bathed one'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'knower of the vedas'? When he has understood evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'knower of the vedas'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'well-learned one'? When he has washed away evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'well-learned one'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'noble one'? When he is purified from evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'noble one'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become an 'arahant'? When he is (completely) purified from evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes an 'arahant'.\n\nThe Blessed One said this.  The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

At that time, the Venerable S\u0101riputta was dwelling in the village of N\u0101laka in Magadha, and he was sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. Cunda, the novice monk, was an attendant of the Venerable S\u0101riputta.\n\nThen the Venerable S\u0101riputta attained final Nibb\u0101na from that very illness. Then Cunda, the novice monk, having taken the alms-bowl and robe of the Venerable S\u0101riputta, went to S\u0101vatthi, to the Jeta's Grove, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika's park, to where the Venerable \u0100nanda was. Having approached, he paid respects to the Venerable \u0100nanda and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Cunda, the novice monk, said to the Venerable \u0100nanda:\n\n\"Venerable sir, S\u0101riputta has attained final Nibb\u0101na. This is his alms-bowl and robe.\"\n\n\"Friend Cunda, this topic should be brought up with the Blessed One. Come, let us go to him and report it.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" Cunda, the novice monk, replied to the Venerable \u0100nanda.\n\nThen the Venerable \u0100nanda and Cunda, the novice monk, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid respects to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable \u0100nanda said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, this novice monk Cunda said: 'Venerable sir, S\u0101riputta has attained final Nibb\u0101na; this is his alms-bowl and robe.' Moreover, venerable sir, I feel as if my body is intoxicated, the directions seem unclear to me, and the teachings do not spring to mind after hearing that 'the Venerable S\u0101riputta has attained final Nibb\u0101na.'\"\n\nWhy, \u0100nanda, when S\u0101riputta attained final Nibb\u0101na, did he take away your aggregate of virtue, your aggregate of collectedness, your aggregate of wisdom, your aggregate of liberation, or your aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir, he did not take my aggregate of virtue, or my aggregate of concentration, or my aggregate of wisdom, or my aggregate of liberation, or my aggregate of knowledge and vision of liberation. However, venerable sir, the Venerable S\u0101riputta was an advisor, one who instilled understanding, explained, demonstrated, encouraged, inspired, and uplifted. He was tireless in teaching the Dhamma and supportive to fellow practitioners. We remember the essence of the Dhamma, the wealth of the Dhamma, and the support of the Dhamma given by the Venerable S\u0101riputta.\"\n\n\"But have I not already declared, \u0100nanda, that we must be parted, separated, and severed from all who are dear and agreeable to us? How, \u0100nanda, can it be obtained: 'May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!'? That is impossible.\n\nJust as, \u0100nanda, a great tree standing sound and possessing heartwood might have its largest branch break off, so too, \u0100nanda, in the great Bhikkhu Sa\u1e45gha standing sound and possessing heartwood, S\u0101riputta has attained final Nibb\u0101na.\n\nHow, \u0100nanda, can it be obtained here: 'May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!'? That is impossible.\n\nTherefore, \u0100nanda, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge.\n\nAnd how, \u0100nanda, does a bhikkhu dwell as an island unto himself, with himself as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge, with the Dhamma as his island, with the Dhamma as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge? Here, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in the body, with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having removed craving and aversion (dissatisfaction) regarding the world. Similarly, he dwells observing feelings in feelings, the mind in the mind, and mental qualities in mental qualities, with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having removed craving and aversion regarding the world.\n\nThis is how, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu dwells as an island unto himself, with himself as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge, with the Dhamma as his island, with the Dhamma as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge.\n\nWhoever, \u0100nanda, now or after my passing, dwells as an island unto themselves, with themselves as their own refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge; with the Dhamma as their island, with the Dhamma as their refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge; they, \u0100nanda, will be the foremost of those who are keen on the training.\""}

He bowed and then sat down to one side.\n\nObserving that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after his meal, the Buddha, on that occasion, recited this verse:\n\n\"When a man is always mindful,\nknowing moderation in eating,\nhis discomfort fades,\nand he ages slowly, taking care of his life.\"\n\nNow at that time the brahmin student Sudassana was standing behind the king.\n\nKing Pasenadi then addressed him: \"Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha's presence and recite it to me whenever I am presented with a meal. I'll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred kah\u0101pa\u1e47as (currency at the time) for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" replied Sudassana. He memorized the verse in the Buddha's presence and recited it whenever the king was presented with a meal:\n\n\"When a man is always mindful,\nknowing moderation in eating,\nhis discomfort fades,\nand he ages slowly, taking care of his life.\"\n\nGradually, the king got used to having no more than a pint of rice. After some time, King Pasenadi's body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, he then expressed this inspired utterance:\n\n\"Truly, the Buddha has shown compassion towards me in both ways: for the benefit in this life and for the future.\""}

There, he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" they replied. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Bhikkhus, do you recall the five lower fetters as I have taught them?\"\n\nWhen this was said, Venerable M\u0101lukyaputta responded to the Blessed One: \"Indeed, venerable sir, I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One.\"\n\n\"How exactly do you remember the five lower fetters as I have taught them, M\u0101lukyaputta?\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, I recall the following as lower fetters taught by the Blessed One: identity-view, doubt (wrt teachings), adherence to rites and rituals, sensual desire, and ill-will. This is how I remember the five lower fetters, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"M\u0101lukyaputta, for what reason do you say that I taught these five lower fetters in this way? Surely, M\u0101lukyaputta, the wanderers of other sects might use the simile of an infant to challenge you. For a young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'self', so how could the view of identity arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards identity-view is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'teachings', so how could doubt about teachings arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards doubt is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'ethics', so how could adherance to rites and rituals arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards such attachment is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'sensual pleasures', so how could sensual desire arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards sensual desire is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'beings', so how could ill-will towards beings arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards ill-will is present within him. Wouldn't the wanderers of other sects use this simile of the infant to challenge you?\"\n\nAfter this was said, Venerable \u0100nanda addressed the Blessed One: \"It is time, Blessed One, it is time, Well-Gone One, for you to teach the five lower fetters. Upon hearing them from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember.\"\n\n\"Therefore, \u0100nanda, listen carefully and pay close attention; I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" replied Venerable \u0100nanda. The Blessed One then spoke:\n\n\"Here, \u0100nanda, an uninstructed ordinary person, who does not regard noble ones and is unskilled and untrained in their Dhamma, who does not regard virtuous people and is unskilled and untrained in their Dhamma, remains entangled and afflicted by identity view; and does not truly understand the escape from arisen identity view. For him, this identity view has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by doubt; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen doubt. This doubt has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by adherance to rites and rituals; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen adherance to rites and rituals. This attachment has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by sensual desire; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen sensual desire. This sensual desire has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by ill-will; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen ill-will. This ill-will has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nMoreover, \u0100nanda, a disciple of the noble ones, who respects the noble ones and is skilled and well-trained in their Dhamma, who respects virtuous people and is skilled and well-trained in their Dhamma, does not remain entangled or afflicted by identity view; he truly understands the escape from any arisen identity view. For him, that identity view and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by doubt; he truly understands the escape from any arisen doubt. For him, that doubt and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by adherance to rites and rituals; he truly understands the escape from any arisen adherance to rites and rituals. For him, that attachment and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by sensual desire; he truly understands the escape from any arisen sensual desire. For him, that sensual desire and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by ill-will; he truly understands the escape from any arisen ill-will. For him, that ill-will and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\n\u0100nanda, there is a path and a way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters. That one could understand, see, or abandon these five lower fetters without following this path and way of practice \u2014 this is not possible. Just as it is impossible to cut out the heartwood of a large, solid tree standing with heartwood without first cutting through its bark and sapwood, similarly, it is not possible to abandon the five lower fetters without adhering to the correct path and way of practice.\n\nFurthermore, \u0100nanda, there is indeed a path and a way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters; that one, by following this path and way of practice, can understand, see, or abandon these five lower fetters \u2014 this possibility does exist.\n\nJust as, \u0100nanda, it is indeed possible for someone to cut through the core of a great tree endowed with heartwood by first slicing through its bark and sapwood, similarly, \u0100nanda, it is indeed possible for one to understand, see, and abandon the five lower fetters by adhering to the correct path and way of practice. Just as, \u0100nanda, the Ganges River, full and overflowing, is impassable in its breadth by a frail person who thinks, 'I will cross this breadth of the Ganges River by cutting through the current safely to the other side'; such a person would not be able to cut through the current and reach the far shore safely. In the same way, \u0100nanda, for those whose minds do not leap forward, become confident, steady, and free when teachings leading to the cessation of identity-view are given, they should be seen as frail like that person. Just as, \u0100nanda, the Ganges River, full and deep, could be crossed by a strong person who thinks, 'I will cut through the current of this river and safely reach the other side'; such a person would be able to cut through the current and safely reach the far shore.\n\nSimilarly, \u0100nanda, for those whose minds do leap forward, become confident, steady, and free when teachings leading to the cessation of identity-view are given, they should be viewed as strong like that person.\n\nAnd what, \u0100nanda, is the path, what is the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters? Here, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu, through solitude from attachments and by abandoning unwholesome mental qualities, with the complete internal stilling of bodily agitation, secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental qualities, enters and dwells in the first jh\u0101na. This jh\u0101na is characterized by reflection and examination of thoughts, and is filled with joy (rapture) and pleasure that are born from seclusion. In this state, he perceives whatever phenomena are present \u2014 whether form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness \u2014 as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibb\u0101na.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibb\u0101na without ever returning from that world. This indeed, \u0100nanda, is the path, the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters.\n\nFurthermore, \u0100nanda, the bhikkhu, upon the subsiding of reflection and examination of thoughts, enters and dwells in the second jh\u0101na \u2026 continues to the third jh\u0101na \u2026 and then enters and dwells in the fourth jh\u0101na. In these states, whatever phenomena are present \u2014 whether form, feeling, perception, volitions, or consciousness \u2014 he perceives as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibb\u0101na.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibb\u0101na without ever returning from that world. This indeed, \u0100nanda, is the path, the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters.\n\nFurthermore, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu, by completely surpassing perceptions of form, with the disappearance of recognition of sense impressions and by not attending to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and dwells in the base of infinite space. Whatever phenomena are present there, whether pertaining to feelings, perceptions, formations, or consciousness - he perceives as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibb\u0101na.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibb\u0101na without ever returning from that world. This, indeed, \u0100nanda, is also the path, the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters.\n\nFurthermore, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu, having completely transcended the base of infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', enters and dwells in the base of infinite consciousness. Whatever phenomena are present there \u2014 whether pertaining to feelings, perceptions, formations, or consciousness \u2014 he perceives as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibb\u0101na.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibb\u0101na without ever returning from that world. This, indeed, \u0100nanda, is also the path, the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters.\n\nFurthermore, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu, having completely transcended the base of infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing', enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. Whatever phenomena are present there \u2014 whether pertaining to feelings, perceptions, formations, or consciousness \u2014 he perceives as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibb\u0101na.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibb\u0101na without ever returning from that world. This, indeed, \u0100nanda, is also the path, the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters.\"\n\n\"If this, venerable sir, is the path and the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters, then why are some bhikkhus said to be 'released by mind' and some bhikkhus are said to be 'released by wisdom'?\"\n\n\"The difference here, \u0100nanda, is in their faculties, I say.\"\n\nThus spoke the Blessed One. The venerable \u0100nanda was satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

Listen to it and pay close attention, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"And what, bhikkhus, is the penetrative exposition, the dhamma exposition? Sensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the result of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood.\n\nFeelings, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of feelings is to be understood; the diversity of feelings is to be understood; the result of feelings is to be understood; the cessation of feelings is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of feelings is to be understood.\n\nPerceptions, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of perceptions is to be understood; the diversity of perceptions is to be understood; the result of perceptions is to be understood; the cessation of perceptions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of perceptions is to be understood.\n\nTaints, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of taints is to be understood; the diversity of taints is to be understood; the result of taints is to be understood; the cessation of taints is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of taints is to be understood.\n\nActions (kamma), bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of actions is to be understood; the diversity of actions is to be understood; the result of actions is to be understood; the cessation of actions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of actions is to be understood.\n\nSuffering (dukkha), bhikkhus, is to be understood; the origin of suffering is to be understood; the diversity of suffering is to be understood; the result of suffering is to be understood; the cessation of suffering is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of suffering is to be understood.\n\nSensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the result of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood. And what is the basis for this statement? There are these five cords of sensual pleasure: forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing; sounds cognizable by the ear... odors cognizable by the nose... tastes cognizable by the tongue... tangibles cognizable by the body that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. However, these are not sensual pleasures; these are sensual strands, in the discipline of the noble ones, it is said:\n\nThe passion and desire for them is the sensual pleasure,\nThe things in the world that are beautiful,\nThe passion and desire for them is the sensual pleasure,\nThey remain beautiful in the world,\nBut the wise abandon desire for them.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of sensual pleasures? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of sensual pleasures.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of sensual pleasures? One kind of desire arises from forms, another kind of desire arises from sounds, another kind of desire arises from odors, another kind of desire arises from tastes, another kind of desire arises from tangibles. This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of sensual pleasures? Bhikkhus, the one who desires and delights in sensual pleasures, by that very desire, produces repeated existence in favorable or unfavorable conditions. This is called the result of sensual pleasures.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of sensual pleasures? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of sensual pleasures. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands sensual pleasures, understands the origin of sensual pleasures, understands the diversity of sensual pleasures, understands the result of sensual pleasures, understands the cessation of sensual pleasures, understands the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures. Sensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nFeelings, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of feelings is to be understood; the diversity of feelings is to be understood; the result of feelings is to be understood; the cessation of feelings is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of feelings is to be understood. And why was this said? There are, bhikkhus, these three kinds of feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of feelings? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of feelings.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of feelings? There is, bhikkhus, sensual pleasant feeling, there is non-sensual pleasant feeling, there is sensual painful feeling, there is non-sensual painful feeling, there is sensual neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, and there is non-sensual neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. This is called the diversity of feelings.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of feelings? Bhikkhus, the one who experiences feelings produces repeated existence in favorable or unfavorable conditions. This is called the result of feelings.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of feelings? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of feelings. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of feelings, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands feelings, understands the origin of feelings, understands the diversity of feelings, understands the result of feelings, understands the cessation of feelings, understands the path leading to the cessation of feelings, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of feelings. Feelings, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of feelings is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nPerceptions, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of perceptions is to be understood; the diversity of perceptions is to be understood; the result of perceptions is to be understood; the cessation of perceptions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of perceptions is to be understood. And why was this said? There are, bhikkhus, these six kinds of perceptions: perception of forms, perception of sounds, perception of odors, perception of tastes, perception of tangibles, perception of mental phenomena.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of perceptions? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of perceptions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of perceptions? One kind of perception arises from forms, another kind of perception arises from sounds, another kind of perception arises from smells, another kind of perception arises from tastes, another kind of perception arises from tangibles, another kind of perception arises from mental phenomena. This is called the diversity of perceptions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of perceptions? Bhikkhus, I say that perception results in verbal expression. As one perceives, so one speaks. Thus one becomes a perceiver. This is called the result of perceptions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of perceptions? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of perceptions. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of perceptions, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands perceptions, understands the origin of perceptions, understands the diversity of perceptions, understands the result of perceptions, understands the cessation of perceptions, understands the path leading to the cessation of perceptions, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of perceptions. Perceptions, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of perceptions is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nTaints, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of taints is to be understood; the diversity of taints is to be understood; the result of taints is to be understood; the cessation of taints is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of taints is to be understood. And why was this said? There are, bhikkhus, these three taints: the taint of sensual pleasure, the taint of existence, the taint of ignorance (unknowing of how things have come to be, unknowing of \"true reality\").\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of taints? Ignorance, bhikkhus, is the origin of taints.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of taints? There are, bhikkhus, taints that lead to rebirth in hell, taints that lead to rebirth in the animal realm, taints that lead to rebirth in the ghost realm, taints that lead to rebirth in the human world, taints that lead to rebirth in the deva world. This is called the diversity of taints.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of taints? Bhikkhus, one who is subject to ignorance produces repeated existence in favorable or unfavorable conditions. This is called the result of taints.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of taints? The cessation of ignorance, bhikkhus, is the cessation of taints. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of taints, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands taints, understands the origin of taints, understands the diversity of taints, understands the result of taints, understands the cessation of taints, understands the path leading to the cessation of taints, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of taints. Taints, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of taints is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nActions (kamma), bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of actions is to be understood; the diversity of actions is to be understood; the result of actions is to be understood; the cessation of actions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of actions is to be understood. And why was this said? I say, bhikkhus, that intention is action. Having intended, one acts by body, speech, and mind.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of actions? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of actions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of actions? There is, bhikkhus, action that leads to rebirth in hell, action that leads to rebirth in the animal realm, action that leads to rebirth in the ghost realm, action that leads to rebirth in the human world, action that leads to rebirth in the deva world. This is called the diversity of actions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of actions? I say, bhikkhus, that there are three kinds of results of actions: results that are experienced in this very life, results that are experienced upon rebirth, and results that are experienced in future lives. This is called the result of actions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of actions? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of actions. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of actions, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands actions, understands the origin of actions, understands the diversity of actions, understands the result of actions, understands the cessation of actions, understands the path leading to the cessation of actions, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of actions. Actions, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of actions is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nSuffering (dukkha), bhikkhus, is to be understood; the origin of suffering is to be understood; the diversity of suffering is to be understood; the result of suffering is to be understood; the cessation of suffering is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of suffering is to be understood. And why was this said? Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair are suffering; association with the unloved is suffering; separation from the loved is suffering; not getting what one wants is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering? Craving, bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of suffering? There is, bhikkhus, intense suffering, there is mild suffering (discontentment), there is slow-fading suffering, there is rapid-fading suffering. This is called the diversity of suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of suffering? Here, bhikkhus, someone who is overwhelmed by suffering and whose mind is exhausted grieves, laments, cries, beats their breast, becomes confused, or seeks external solutions: 'Who knows a remedy for this suffering?' I say, bhikkhus, that suffering results in either confusion or external seeking. This is called the result of suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of suffering? The cessation of craving, bhikkhus, is the cessation of suffering. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of suffering, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands suffering, understands the origin of suffering, understands the diversity of suffering, understands the result of suffering, understands the cessation of suffering, understands the path leading to the cessation of suffering, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of suffering. Suffering, bhikkhus, is to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of suffering is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the penetrative exposition, the dhamma exposition.\""}

Greed (lust, desire, attachment), aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment), and delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification).\n\nGreed is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by greed chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, due to greed, originating from greed, arising from greed, dependent on greed, many evil, unwholesome states come to be.\n\nHate is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by hate chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. And so these many bad, unwholesome things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by hate. Thus, due to hate, originating from hate, arising from hate, dependent on hate, many evil, unwholesome states come to be.\n\nDelusion is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by delusion chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When a such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, due to delusion, originating from delusion, arising from delusion, dependent on delusion, many evil, unwholesome states come to be. Such a person, bhikkhus, is called a speaker at the wrong time, speaker of falsehoods, speaker of what is not beneficial, speaker against the Dhamma, speaker against discipline.\n\nWhy, bhikkhus, is such a person called a speaker at the wrong time, speaker of falsehoods, speaker of what is not beneficial, speaker against the Dhamma, speaker against discipline? Because, bhikkhus, this person causes suffering to another through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. When spoken to truthfully, he disregards it, does not acknowledge it; when spoken to untruthfully, he does not make an effort to clarify, saying 'this is false, this is untrue.' Therefore, such a person is called a speaker at the wrong time, speaker of falsehoods, speaker of what is not beneficial, speaker against the Dhamma, speaker against discipline.\n\nSuch a person, bhikkhus, overwhelmed, with a mind overwhelmed by evil, unwholesome states of greed, hate and delusion, experiences suffering in this very life, with distress, with misery, with agony. And after the breakup of the body, after death, rebirth in a state of deprivation is to be expected. Suppose a sal, dhava (axlewood), or a bamboo was choked and engulfed by three kinds of creepers, it would fall to ruin and disaster. In the same way, such a person\u2014overcome with bad, unwholesome qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion\u2014suffers in the present life, with anguish, distress, and fever. And when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect to be reborn in a bad place.\n\nThese are the three unwholesome roots.\n\nThere are these three wholesome roots. What three? Contentment, good-will (loving-kindness), and wisdom (inclination to carefully examine and independently verify).\n\nContentment is a root of the wholesome. When a contented person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by greed, doesn't cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, due to contentment, originating from contentment, arising from contentment, dependent on contentment, many wholesome states come to be.\n\nGood-will is a root of the wholesome. When a loving person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by hate, doesn't cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, due to good-will, originating from good-will, arising from good-will, dependent on good-will, many wholesome states come to be.\n\nWisdom is a root of the wholesome. When a wise person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, with a mind not overcome by delusion, doesn't cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, due to wisdom, originating from wisdom, arising from wisdom, dependent on wisdom, many wholesome states come to be. Such a person, bhikkhus, is called a speaker at the right time, a speaker of truths, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker in accordance with the Dhamma, a speaker in accordance with discipline.\n\nWhy, bhikkhus, is such a person called a speaker at the right time, a speaker of truths, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker in accordance with the Dhamma, a speaker in accordance with discipline? Because, bhikkhus, this person does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. When spoken to truthfully, they acknowledge it and do not scorn; when spoken to untruthfully, they make an effort to clarify, saying 'this is false, this is untrue.' Therefore, such a person is called a speaker at the right time, a speaker of truths, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker in accordance with the Dhamma, a speaker in accordance with discipline.\n\nFor such a person, bhikkhus, bad unwholesome qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In the present life, they live happily, free of anguish, distress, and fever. In the present life, they are extinguished.\n\nSuppose, bhikkhus, a sal tree, or an axlewood, or a bamboo was choked and engulfed by three kinds of creepers. Then a person comes with a spade and basket. They would cut the creeper at the root, dig it up, and pull it out, down to the fibers and stems. Then they would split the creeper apart, cut up the parts, and chop it into splinters. They would dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they would sweep away the ashes in a strong wind or float them away down a swift stream. In the same way, bhikkhus, for such a person, bad unwholesome qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In the present life, they live happily, free of anguish, distress, and fever. In the present life, they are extinguished.\n\nThese, bhikkhus, are the three wholesome roots."}

However, his five sense faculties still operate. Because of their operation without impairment, he experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, and feels pleasure and pain. The ending of passion (greed, desire, attachment), the ending of aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment), the ending of delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification) \u2014 this is called, bhikkhus, the Nibb\u0101na element with fuel remaining.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the Nibb\u0101na element without fuel remaining?

Listen well and pay close attention; I will speak.\"\n\n\"Indeed, venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n### Fourty-Four Bases of Knowledge\n\n\"What, bhikkhus, are the forty-four bases of knowledge? Knowledge of aging and death, knowledge of the arising of aging and death, knowledge of the cessation of aging and death, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging and death; knowledge of birth, knowledge of the arising of birth, knowledge of the cessation of birth, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of birth; knowledge of continued existence, knowledge of the arising of continued existence, knowledge of the cessation of continued existence, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of continued existence; knowledge of clinging, knowledge of the arising of clinging, knowledge of the cessation of clinging, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of clinging; knowledge of craving, knowledge of the arising of craving, knowledge of the cessation of craving, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of craving; knowledge of feeling, knowledge of the arising of feeling, knowledge of the cessation of feeling, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of feeling; knowledge of contact, knowledge of the arising of contact, knowledge of the cessation of contact, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of contact; knowledge of the six sense bases, knowledge of the arising of the six sense bases, knowledge of the cessation of the six sense bases, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of the six sense bases; knowledge of name-and-form, knowledge of the arising of name-and-form, knowledge of the cessation of name-and-form, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of name-and-form; knowledge of consciousness, knowledge of the arising of consciousness, knowledge of the cessation of consciousness, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousness; knowledge of volitional formations, knowledge of the arising of volitional formations, knowledge of the cessation of volitional formations, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations. These are called, bhikkhus, the forty-four bases of knowledge.\n\n#### Aging and Death\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is aging and death? The aging is the aging of various beings in their respective species, the wear and tear, the breaking down, the falling apart, the wrinkling, and the decline of life, the maturity of the faculties. This is called aging. The cutting off from, the passing away from, the dissolution of, the disappearance of, the dying, the completion of time, the breaking up of the aggregates, the laying down of the body, of various beings in their respective species. This is called death. Thus, this is aging and this is death; this is called, bhikkhus, aging and death.\n\nThe arising of birth is the arising of aging and death; the cessation of birth is the cessation of aging and death; this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, that is \u2014 right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple understands aging and death, understands the arising of aging and death, understands the cessation of aging and death, understands the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, this is his knowledge of the Dhamma. By this Dhamma seen and known directly, immediately, attained and grasped, he transcends the past and the future.\n\n'Whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past fully understood aging and death, the arising of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, all fully understood in the same way as I do now.\n\nAnd whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will fully understand aging and death, the arising of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, all will fully understand in the same way as I do now.' This is his knowledge by way of inference.\n\n#### Endowed with Right View\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple's these two knowledges are purified and cleansed \u2014 knowledge of the Dhamma (clear apprehension of how things have come to be) and knowledge by way of inference. This is called, bhikkhus, a noble disciple endowed with right view, endowed with right vision, arrived at this true Dhamma, seeing this true Dhamma, equipped with the trainee's knowledge, equipped with the trainee's wisdom, attained to the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, stands touching the door to the deathless.\"\n\n#### Volitional Formations\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is birth... what, bhikkhus, is continued existence... what, bhikkhus, is clinging... what, bhikkhus, is craving... what, bhikkhus, is feeling... what, bhikkhus, is contact... what, bhikkhus, are the six sense bases... what, bhikkhus, is name-and-form... what, bhikkhus, is consciousness... what, bhikkhus, are volitional formations? There are these three volitional formations: bodily formations, verbal formations, mental formations. These are called, bhikkhus, volitional formations.\n\nThe arising of ignorance is the arising of volitional formations; the cessation of ignorance is the cessation of volitional formations; this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, that is \u2014 right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right collectedness.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple understands volitional formations, understands the arising of volitional formations, understands the cessation of volitional formations, understands the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, this is his knowledge of the Dhamma. By this Dhamma seen and known directly, immediately, attained and grasped, he transcends the past and the future.\n\nWhatever ascetics or brahmins in the past fully understood volitional formations, the arising of volitional formations, the cessation of volitional formations, the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, all fully understood in the same way as I do now.\n\nAnd whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will fully understand volitional formations, the arising of volitional formations, the cessation of volitional formations, the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, all will fully understand in the same way as I do now. This is his knowledge by way of inference.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple's these two knowledges are purified and cleansed \u2014 knowledge of the Dhamma (clear apprehension of how things have come to be) and knowledge by way of inference.

While seated to one side, J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"I have heard, venerable sir: 'They slaughter living beings for the ascetic Gotama; the ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared for him, thus implicating himself in the act.' Those who say, 'They slaughter living beings for the ascetic Gotama; the ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared for him, thus implicating himself in the act,' do they speak in accordance with the Blessed One's teaching, without misrepresenting him with what is not true, and explaining in accordance with the Dhamma, without finding fault in agreement with the Dhamma?\"\n\n\"J\u012bvaka, those who say, 'They slaughter living beings for the ascetic Gotama; the ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared for him, thus implicating himself in the act' do not speak in accordance with my teaching, and they accuse me falsely with what is not true.\n\nI declare, J\u012bvaka, that there are three circumstances in which meat should not be consumed: when it is seen, heard, or suspected (that the living being has been slaughtered specifically for oneself) \u2014 in these three circumstances, I declare that meat should not be consumed.\n\nI declare, J\u012bvaka, that there are three circumstances in which meat may be consumed: when it is not seen, not heard, and not suspected (that the living being has been slaughtered specifically for oneself) \u2014 in these three circumstances, I declare that meat may be consumed.\n\nHere, J\u012bvaka, a bhikkhu dwells depending on a certain village or town. With a mind accompanied by loving-kindness, he dwells pervading one direction, in the same way the second, in the same way the third, in the same way the fourth. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind accompanied by loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill-will. Then, a householder or a householder's son comes to him and invites him for the next day's meal. If he wishes, J\u012bvaka, the bhikkhu accepts the invitation.\n\nAfter the night has passed, in the morning, he dresses, takes his bowl and robe, and goes to the house of the one who invited him; having approached, he sits down on the prepared seat. Then, that householder or householder's son serves him with good food. He does not think: 'It is good that the householder serves me with the good food, or they will serve me again in the future with such good food' \u2014 he does not think like that. He consumes the food not attached, not infatuated, not clinging, seeing the danger, and understanding the escape.\n\nWhat do you think, J\u012bvaka, does that bhikkhu at that time intend harm for himself, for others, or for both?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Then, J\u012bvaka, that bhikkhu at that time consumes blameless food, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Indeed, venerable sir. I have heard, venerable sir: 'Brahm\u0101 dwells spreading goodwill.'

If you speak with this in mind, J\u012bvaka, I allow you to say so.\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I had in mind, venerable sir.\"\n\nHere, J\u012bvaka, a bhikkhu dwells depending on a certain village or town. He dwells pervading one direction with a mind accompanied by compassion, in the same way the second, in the same way the third, in the same way the fourth. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind accompanied by compassion, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill-will.\n\nWith a mind accompanied by empathetic joy, he dwells pervading one quarter, in the same way the second, in the same way the third, in the same way the fourth. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind accompanied by empathetic joy, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill-will.\n\nWith a mind accompanied by equanimity, he dwells pervading one quarter, in the same way the second, in the same way the third, in the same way the fourth. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind accompanied by equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill-will. Then, a householder or a householder's son invites him for a meal. The bhikkhu, if he likes, may accept the invitation.\n\nAfter the night has passed, in the morning, he dresses, takes his bowl and robe, and goes to the house of the one who invited him; having approached, he sits down on the prepared seat. Then, that householder or householder's son serves him with good food. He does not think: 'It is good that the householder serves me with the good food, or they will serve me again in the future with such good food'\u2014he does not think like that. He consumes the food not attached, not infatuated, not clinging, seeing the danger, and understanding the escape.\n\nWhat do you think, J\u012bvaka, does that bhikkhu at that time intend harm for himself, for others, or for both?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Then, J\u012bvaka, that bhikkhu at that time consumes blameless food, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Indeed, venerable sir.

If you speak with this in mind, J\u012bvaka, I allow you to say so.\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I had in mind, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"J\u012bvaka, anyone who slaughters a living being for the Tath\u0101gata or his disciple accumulates much demerit in five ways.\n\nWhen that householder says: 'Go, fetch that living being for me,' by this first instance, he accumulates much demerit.\n\nWhen that living being experiences pain and distress being led with a noose, by this second instance, he accumulates much demerit.\n\nWhen he says: 'Slaughter that living being for me,' by this third instance, he accumulates much demerit.\n\nWhen that living being experiences pain and distress during the slaughter, by this fourth instance, he accumulates much demerit.\n\nWhen he presents the Tath\u0101gata or his disciple with food that is not allowable, by this fifth instance, he accumulates much demerit.\n\nJ\u012bvaka, anyone who slaughters a living being for the Tath\u0101gata or his disciple accumulates much demerit through these five ways.\"\n\nWhen this was said, J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca said to the Blessed One: \"Wonderful, venerable sir, marvelous, venerable sir. It is fitting, venerable sir, that bhikkhus consume food in such a blameless manner. Splendid, venerable sir, splendid...

In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.\n\nSimilarly, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort\u2014my investigation will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware \u2014 as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, one experiences various kinds of psychic abilities: being one, one becomes many; being many, one becomes one; one appears and disappears; one passes through walls, enclosures, and mountains as though through space; one dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; one walks on water without sinking as though on solid ground; one flies through the air cross-legged like a bird with wings; one touches and strokes with one's hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; and one controls the body as far as the Brahm\u0101 (God) world.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, with the purified divine ear surpassing the human, one hears both kinds of sounds: divine and human, far and near.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, one understands the minds of other beings, other persons, having encompassed them with one's own mind. One knows a mind with lust as 'with lust,' and a mind without lust as 'without lust'; a mind with hate as 'with hate,' and a mind without hate as 'without hate'; a mind with delusion as 'with delusion,' and a mind without delusion as 'without delusion'; a contracted mind as 'contracted,' and a distracted mind as 'distracted'; a developed mind as 'developed,' and an undeveloped mind as 'undeveloped'; a surpassable mind as 'surpassable,' and an unsurpassable mind as 'unsurpassable'; a collected mind as 'collected,' and an uncollected mind as 'uncollected'; a liberated mind as 'liberated,' and an unliberated mind as 'unliberated.'\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, one recollects their manifold past lives: one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births; many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span; and passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span; and passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus with their aspects and particulars, one recollects their manifold past lives.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, with the purified divine eye surpassing the human, one sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and one understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus: 'These beings, who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. But these beings, who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the Noble Ones, who held right view and undertook actions under the influence of right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the purified divine eye surpassing the human, one sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understands how beings pass on according to their actions.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, through the wearing away of the taints, one realizes for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.\""}

The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"And what, bhikkhus, is the arising of the world? Depending on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact.

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus\".\n\n\"Venerable sir\", those bhikkhus responded to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: \n\n\"Before my enlightenment, when I was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta (a being seeking enlightenment), it occurred to me, 'What if I divided my thoughts into two kinds?' Thus, bhikkhus, I made one part consist of the thoughts of sensuality (acquisition), ill-will (resentment, hostility, hate), and harm (an active intent of causing physical or psychological harm); and the other part consist of the thoughts of relinquishment (letting go, giving up), non-ill-will (good-will, loving-kindness), and non-harm (compassion).\n\n### Unwholesome Thoughts\n\n#### Sensuality\n\nWhile ardently and resolutely dwelling, a thought of sensuality arose in me, bhikkhus. I then understood: 'This thought of sensuality has arisen. It leads to harm for myself, to the harm of others, and to the harm of both. It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibb\u0101na.' Reflecting in this way, bhikkhus, that 'It leads to my harm,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of others,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of both,' it subsided in me; 'It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibb\u0101na,' it also subsided in me. Therefore, bhikkhus, whenever a thought of sensuality arose, I immediately abandoned it, removed it, and completely eradicated it.\n\n#### Ill-will And Harm\n\nAs I was ardently and resolutely dwelling, bhikkhus, a thought of ill-will and a thought of harm arose in me. I then understood: 'This thought of harm has arisen in me. It leads to my harm, to the harm of others, and to the harm of both. It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibb\u0101na.' Reflecting thus, bhikkhus, that 'It leads to my harm,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of others,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of both,' it subsided in me; 'It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibb\u0101na,' also it subsided in me. Therefore, bhikkhus, whenever a thought of harm arose, I immediately abandoned it, removed it, and completely eradicated it.\n\nWhatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks about and ponders upon, bhikkhus, that will become the inclination of his mind. If a bhikkhu frequently thinks about and ponders upon thoughts of sensuality, he abandons thoughts of relinquishment, makes thoughts of sensuality predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of sensuality. Similarly, if he frequently engages with thoughts of ill-will and harming, he abandons thoughts of non-harming, makes thoughts of harming predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of harming.\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, in the last month of the rainy season, during the autumn when the fields are muddy, a cowherd guards his cows by prodding them here and there with a stick, blocking their path, restraining them, and preventing them from straying. Why does he do this? Because he sees that straying could lead to punishment, capture, confiscation, or blame.\n\nSimilarly, bhikkhus, I perceived the danger, inferiority and defilement in unwholesome states, and the benefit and the purification in wholesome states of relinquishment.\n\n### Wholesome Thoughts\n\n#### Relinquishment\n\nWhile ardently and resolutely dwelling, a thought of relinquishment arose in me, bhikkhus. I then understood: 'This thought of relinquishment has arisen in me. It leads neither to harm for myself, nor for others, nor for both. It cultivates wisdom, is free from affliction, and leads towards Nibb\u0101na.' Reflecting in this way, bhikkhus, whether I contemplated it by night or pondered it by day, I perceived no fear arising from it. Nevertheless, should I think and ponder too long, my body would fatigue. When the body is fatigued, the mind gets disturbed; a disturbed mind is far from being concentrated. Therefore, bhikkhus, I stabilized my mind internally, settled it, unified it, and concentrated it. Why? So that my mind might not become disturbed.\n\n#### Non-Ill-Will And Non-Harm\n\nWhile ardently and resolutely dwelling, bhikkhus, thoughts of non-ill-will and non-harming arose in me. I then understood: 'This thought of non-harming has arisen in me. It leads neither to harm for myself, nor for others, nor for both. It cultivates wisdom, is free from affliction, and leads towards Nibb\u0101na.' Reflecting in this way, bhikkhus, whether I contemplated it by night or pondered it by day, I perceived no fear arising from it. However, should I think and ponder too long, my body would become fatigued. When the body is fatigued, the mind becomes disturbed; a disturbed mind is far from being concentrated. Therefore, bhikkhus, I stabilized my mind internally, settled it, unified it, and concentrated it. Why? So that my mind might not become disturbed.\n\nWhatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks about and ponders upon, bhikkhus, that will become the inclination of his mind. If a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of relinquishment, he abandons thoughts of sensuality, makes thoughts of relinquishment predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of relinquishment. Similarly, if a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of non-ill-will and non-harming, he abandons thoughts of harm, makes thoughts of non-harming predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of non-harming.\n\nJust as in the last month of the hot season, when all the crops have been brought inside the villages, a cowherd would guard his cows while stationed at the root of a tree or in the open, since he needs only to be mindful that the cows are there; so too, there was need for me only to be mindful that those states were there.\n\n### The Four Jh\u0101nas\n\nBhikkhus, unrelenting energy was aroused (in me), clear and unforgetful mindfulness was established, the body was tranquil and unexcited, and the mind was collected and unified.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, having secluded myself from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental states, with reflection and examination (of thoughts), born of seclusion, filled with joyful pleasure, I entered and dwelled in the first jh\u0101na.\n\nWith the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, devoid of reflection and examination, born of collectedness and filled with joyful pleasure, I entered and dwelled in the second jh\u0101na.\n\nWith the fading away of joyful pleasure, I dwelled equanimous and mindful, fully aware, and experienced physical pleasure, which the noble ones describe as 'one who dwells happily, equanimous and mindful.' Thus, I entered and dwelled in the third jh\u0101na.\n\nWith the abandonment of ease (bliss) and suffering (discontentment, stress), and with the previous disappearance of joy and sorrow, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensation, and with the purity of equanimity and mindfulness, I entered and dwelled in the fourth jh\u0101na.\n\n### The Three True Knowledges\n\nThus, with my mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, I directed my mind towards the knowledge of recalling past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, including details and brief descriptions of each life.\n\nIn the first watch of the night, bhikkhus, I attained the first knowledge: ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, and light arose, as occurs for one who is diligent, ardent, and resolute in practice.\n\nThus, with my mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, I directed my mind toward the knowledge of the death and rebirth of beings. With the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing, endowed with bodily misconduct and other misdeeds, in various states, fair and foul, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood them according to their actions.\n\nIn the middle watch of the night, I attained the second knowledge: once more, ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, and light arose, reflecting the state of one who is diligent, ardent, and resolute in practice.\n\nThus, with my mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, I directed my mind towards the knowledge of eradicating the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'\n\n'I know these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is, 'This is the origin of these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is, 'This is the cessation of these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is, 'This is the way leading to the cessation of these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is. Knowing and seeing thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of ignorance. In me, liberated, there arose the knowledge of liberation: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nThis, bhikkhus, was the third knowledge attained by me in the last watch of the night; ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, and light arose, as happens in one who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute.\n\nSuppose, bhikkhus, in a wooded range there is a great low-lying marsh near which a large herd of deer resides. A man appears, desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage, and closes off the safe and good path to be joyfully traveled, opens a false path, and sets out a decoy and a dummy, leading the herd towards calamity, disaster, and loss. Yet another man appears, desiring their good, welfare, and protection. He reopens the safe and good path leading to their happiness, closes off the false path, removes the decoy, and destroys the dummy, enabling the herd to achieve growth, increase, and fulfillment.\n\nBhikkhus, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning. This is the meaning: 'The great low-lying marsh' is a term for sensual pleasures. 'The large herd of deer' represents beings. 'The man desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage' is a term for M\u0101ra the Evil One. 'The false path' represents the wrong eightfold path - wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong collectedness (concentration). 'The decoy' is a term for delight and lust. 'The dummy' is a term for ignorance (misapprehension of true reality/how things have come to be). 'The man desiring their good, welfare, and protection' is a term for the Tath\u0101gata, the accomplished and fully enlightened one. 'The safe and good path to be traveled joyfully' is a term for the Noble Eightfold Path - right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness (concentration).\n\nSo, bhikkhus, the safe and good path to be traveled joyfully has been reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy removed, the dummy destroyed.\n\nWhat a teacher should do out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, I have done for you, bhikkhus. Here are these roots of trees, here are these empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be negligent; lest you later regret it. This is our instruction to you.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

Attamano \u0101yasm\u0101 r\u0101hulo bhagavato bh\u0101sita\u1e41 abhinand\u012bti.", "output": "Thus have I heard - At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in R\u0101jagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.\n\nNow at that time, the venerable R\u0101hula was dwelling at Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhika. Then the Blessed One, having arisen from seclusion in the evening time, approached Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhika, where the venerable R\u0101hula was. The venerable R\u0101hula saw the Blessed One approaching from afar. Having seen him, he prepared a seat and water for his feet. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down, he washed his feet. The venerable R\u0101hula also, having paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side.\n\n### An Intentional Lie\n\nThen the Blessed One placed a small amount of leftover water in the water vessel and addressed the venerable R\u0101hula: \"R\u0101hula, do you see this small amount of leftover water in the water vessel?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Even so little, R\u0101hula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having discarded the small amount of leftover water, addressed the venerable R\u0101hula: \"Do you see this small amount of leftover water discarded, R\u0101hula?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Thus, discarded, R\u0101hula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having overturned that water vessel, addressed the venerable R\u0101hula: \"Do you see this overturned water vessel, R\u0101hula?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Thus overturned, R\u0101hula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having turned the water vessel upright, addressed the venerable R\u0101hula: \"R\u0101hula, do you see this hollow and empty water vessel?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Even so hollow and empty, R\u0101hula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\n#### Simile Of The King's Elephant\n\n\"Just as, R\u0101hula, a king's elephant with sharp tusks, of a mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, acts with his front body, acts with his hind body, acts with his head, acts with his ears, acts with his tusks, acts with his tail; however, he protects his trunk. Then his rider would think: 'This king's elephant with sharp tusks, mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, and acts with his tail; however, it protects his trunk. He has not yet given up his life.'\n\nWhen, R\u0101hula, a king's elephant with sharp tusks, mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, acts with his front body, acts with his hind body, acts with his head, acts with his ears, acts with his tusks, acts with his tail, and acts with his trunk, then his rider would think: 'This king's elephant with sharp tusks, mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, acts with his front body, acts with his hind body, acts with his head, acts with his ears, acts with his tusks, acts with his tail, and acts with his trunk. He has given up his life. Now there is nothing that the king's elephant will not do.'\n\nJust so, R\u0101hula, for anyone who does not feel shame in telling an intentional lie, there is no evil that they will not do, I say. Therefore, R\u0101hula, you should train yourself thus: 'I will not tell an intentional lie even as a joke.' This is how you should train yourself, R\u0101hula.\n\n### Reflection On Action\n\nWhat do you think, R\u0101hula, what is the purpose of a mirror?\"\n\n\"It is for reflection, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Just so, R\u0101hula, reflecting repeatedly, action should be done with the body; reflecting repeatedly, action should be done with speech; reflecting repeatedly, action should be done with the mind.\"\n\n#### Bodily Action\n\n##### Before Acting\n\n\"Whatever bodily action you intend to do, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that bodily action: 'Would this bodily action I intend to do lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Is this an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I intend to do would lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This is an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then such a bodily action, R\u0101hula, should not be done by you. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I intend to do would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. This is a wholesome bodily action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then such a bodily action, R\u0101hula, should be done by you.\n\n##### While Acting\n\nWhile you are doing a bodily action, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very bodily action: 'Would this bodily action I am doing lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Is this an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I am doing leads to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This is an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then you should stop such a bodily action, R\u0101hula. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I am doing would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. This is a wholesome bodily action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then you should continue such a bodily action, R\u0101hula.\n\n##### After Acting\n\nHaving done a bodily action, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very bodily action: 'Did this bodily action I did lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Was this an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I did led to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This was an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then such a bodily action should be confessed to the teacher, to the wise, or to fellow practitioners. It should be revealed, it should be openly declared. Having confessed, revealed, and openly declared it, restraint should be undertaken in the future. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I did would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. This was a wholesome bodily action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then you should dwell with joy and ease, R\u0101hula, devoted to practicing wholesome qualities day and night.\"\n\n#### Verbal Action\n\n##### Before Acting\n\nWhatever verbal action you intend to do, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very verbal action: 'Would this verbal action I intend to do lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Is this an unwholesome verbal action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This verbal action I intend to do leads to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This is an unwholesome verbal action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then such a verbal action, R\u0101hula, should not be done by you. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This verbal action I intend to do would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others. This is a wholesome verbal action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then such a verbal action, R\u0101hula, should be done by you.\n\n##### While Acting\n\nWhile you are doing a verbal action, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very verbal action: 'Would this verbal action I am doing lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Is this an unwholesome verbal action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This verbal action I am doing leads to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This is an unwholesome verbal action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then you should stop such a verbal action, R\u0101hula. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This verbal action I am doing would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. This is a wholesome verbal action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then you should continue such a verbal action, R\u0101hula.\n\n##### After Acting\n\nHaving done a verbal action, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very verbal action: 'Did this verbal action I did lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Was this an unwholesome verbal action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This verbal action I did led to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This was an unwholesome verbal action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then such a verbal action should be confessed to the teacher, to the wise, or to fellow practitioners. It should be revealed, it should be openly declared. Having confessed, revealed, and openly declared it, restraint should be undertaken in the future. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This verbal action I did would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. This was a wholesome verbal action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then you should dwell with joy and ease, R\u0101hula, devoted to practicing wholesome qualities day and night.\"\n\n#### Mental Action\n\n##### Before Acting\n\n\"Whatever mental action you intend to do, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very mental action: 'Would this mental action I intend to do lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Is this an unwholesome mental action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This mental action I intend to do leads to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This is an unwholesome mental action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then such a mental action, R\u0101hula, should not be done by you. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This mental action I intend to do would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others. This is a wholesome mental action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then such a mental action, R\u0101hula, should be done by you.\n\n##### While Acting\n\nWhile you are doing a mental action, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very mental action: 'Would this mental action I am doing lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Is this an unwholesome mental action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This mental action I am doing leads to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This is an unwholesome mental action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then you should stop such a mental action, R\u0101hula. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This mental action I am doing would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. This is a wholesome mental action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then you should continue such a mental action, R\u0101hula.\n\n##### After Acting\n\nHaving done a mental action, R\u0101hula, you should reflect upon that very mental action: 'Did this mental action I did lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both? Was this an unwholesome mental action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering?' If, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This mental action I did led to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This was an unwholesome mental action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then, R\u0101hula, such a mental action should be abhorred, despised, and rid of. Having abhorred, despised, and rid of it, restraint should be undertaken in the future. If, however, R\u0101hula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This mental action I did would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both. This was a wholesome mental action with pleasant consequences, resulting in happiness,' then you should dwell with joy and ease, R\u0101hula, devoted to practicing wholesome qualities day and night.\n\nR\u0101hula, whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past purified their bodily actions, purified their verbal actions, and purified their mental actions, they all did so by repeatedly reflecting thus: by reflecting thus, they purified their bodily actions; by reflecting thus, they purified their verbal actions; by reflecting thus, they purified their mental actions. And whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will purify their bodily actions, will purify their verbal actions, and will purify their mental actions, they all will do so by repeatedly reflecting thus: by reflecting thus, they will purify their bodily actions; by reflecting thus, they will purify their verbal actions; by reflecting thus, they will purify their mental actions. And whatever ascetics or brahmins at present purify their bodily actions, purify their verbal actions, and purify their mental actions, they all do so by repeatedly reflecting thus: by reflecting thus, they purify their bodily actions; by reflecting thus, they purify their verbal actions; by reflecting thus, they purify their mental actions. Therefore, R\u0101hula, you should train yourself thus: 'I will purify my bodily actions by reflecting repeatedly; I will purify my verbal actions by reflecting repeatedly; I will purify my mental actions by reflecting repeatedly.' This is how you should train yourself, R\u0101hula.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. Satisfied, the venerable R\u0101hula rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Ves\u0101li for alms. After going on almsround in Ves\u0101li and returning from his almsround after his meal, the Blessed One addressed Venerable \u0100nanda: \"Take your sitting mat, \u0100nanda. We shall go to the C\u0101p\u0101la Shrine for the day's abiding.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" Venerable \u0100nanda replied to the Blessed One, and taking his sitting mat, followed closely behind the Blessed One.\n\nThen the Blessed One went to the C\u0101p\u0101la Shrine and, upon arrival, sat down on the prepared seat. Venerable \u0100nanda paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While seated to one side, the Blessed One addressed Venerable \u0100nanda:\n\n\"Ves\u0101li is pleasing, \u0100nanda, Udena Shrine is pleasing, Gotamaka Shrine is pleasing, Sattamba Shrine is pleasing, Bahuputta Shrine is pleasing, S\u0101randada Shrine is pleasing, and C\u0101p\u0101la Shrine is pleasing. \u0100nanda, whoever has developed and frequently practiced the four bases of psychic ability, mastered them, firmly established them, repeatedly practiced them, consolidated them, and resolutely undertaken them, could, if they so wished, live for an aeon (lifespan of a world system) or the remainder of an aeon. The Tath\u0101gata, \u0100nanda, has developed and frequently practiced these four bases of psychic ability, mastered them, firmly established them, repeatedly practiced them, consolidated them, and resolutely undertaken them. If he so wished, \u0100nanda, the Tath\u0101gata could live for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon.\"\n\nEven so, while the Blessed One was giving such a clear and evident sign, venerable \u0100nanda was unable to comprehend and did not beg the Blessed One, saying, 'May the Blessed One remain for an aeon, may the Blessed One remain for the benefit and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans,' because his mind was overwhelmed by M\u0101ra.\n\nA second time, the Blessed One ... A third time, the Blessed One addressed Venerable \u0100nanda:\n\n\"Ves\u0101li is pleasing, \u0100nanda, Udena Shrine is pleasing, Gotamaka Shrine is pleasing, Sattamba Shrine is pleasing, Bahuputta Shrine is pleasing, S\u0101randada Shrine is pleasing, and C\u0101p\u0101la Shrine is pleasing. \u0100nanda, whoever has developed and frequently practiced the four bases of psychic ability, mastered them, firmly established them, repeatedly practiced them, consolidated them, and resolutely undertaken them, could, if they so wished, live for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon.

Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibb\u0101na. Venerable sir, the Blessed One has said: 'I will not attain final Nibb\u0101na until my bhikkhus are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it, until the Dhamma has been well proclaimed among gods and humans.'\n\nNow, venerable sir, there are bhikkhus who are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining them, teaching them, declaring them, establishing them, disclosing them, analyzing them, and explaining them. Let the Fortunate One now attain final Nibb\u0101na, let the Blessed One now attain final Nibb\u0101na. Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibb\u0101na.\n\nThe Blessed One has also said: 'I will not attain final Nibb\u0101na until my bhikkhunis are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it, until the Dhamma has been well proclaimed among gods and humans.'\n\nNow, venerable sir, there are bhikkhunis who are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it. Let the Fortunate One now attain final Nibb\u0101na, let the Blessed One now attain final Nibb\u0101na. Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibb\u0101na.\n\nThe Blessed One has also said: 'I will not attain final Nibb\u0101na until my male lay followers ... female lay followers are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it, until the Dhamma has been well proclaimed among gods and humans.'\n\nNow, venerable sir, there are male lay followers ... female lay followers who are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it. Let the Fortunate One now attain final Nibb\u0101na, let the Blessed One now attain final Nibb\u0101na. Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibb\u0101na.\n\nThe Blessed One has also said: 'I will not attain final Nibb\u0101na until this spiritual life has been well-established, well-developed, widespread, well-proclaimed, and well-established among gods and humans.' Now, venerable sir, this spiritual life has been well-established, well-developed, widespread, well-proclaimed, and well-established among gods and humans. Let the Fortunate One now attain final Nibb\u0101na, let the Blessed One now attain final Nibb\u0101na. Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibb\u0101na.\"\n\nWhen this was said, the Blessed One addressed M\u0101ra the Evil One: \"Be at ease now, M\u0101ra. The Tath\u0101gata's final Nibb\u0101na will not be long delayed. Three months from now, the Tath\u0101gata will attain final Nibb\u0101na.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, mindful and fully aware, relinquished the life force at the C\u0101p\u0101la Shrine. When the Blessed One had relinquished the life force, there was a great earthquake, terrifying and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then the Blessed One, understanding the significance of this moment, uttered this inspired utterance:\n\n\"Comparing both the comparable and the incomparable,\nThe sage relinquished the formations of continued existence;\nRejoicing within, mentally composed,\nHe shattered the armor of self-existence.\""}

Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after this friendly exchange, he sat down to one side. As he was seated to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: \"For a long time, I have been a companion in discussion with venerable Gotama. It would be good if Venerable Gotama would teach me briefly about wholesome and unwholesome states.\"\n\n### Wholesome and Unwholesome States\n\n\"Vaccha, I can teach you about wholesome and unwholesome states briefly or in detail. Still, let me do so in brief. Listen and pay close attention, and I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, Venerable sir,\" the wanderer Vacchagotta replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Greed (lust, desire, attachment), Vaccha, is unwholesome; non-greed is wholesome. Aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment), Vaccha, is unwholesome; good-will (friendliness, loving-kindness) is wholesome. Delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification), Vaccha, is unwholesome; non-delusion is wholesome. Thus, Vaccha, these three qualities are unwholesome, and these three qualities are wholesome.\n\nKilling living beings, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from killing living beings is wholesome. Taking what is not given, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from taking what is not given is wholesome. Sexual misconduct, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from sexual misconduct is wholesome. False speech, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from false speech is wholesome. Malicious speech, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from malicious speech is wholesome. Harsh speech, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from harsh speech is wholesome. Idle chatter, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from idle chatter is wholesome. Craving, Vaccha, is unwholesome; contentment is wholesome. Ill-will, Vaccha, is unwholesome; non-ill-will is wholesome. Wrong view, Vaccha, is unwholesome; right view is wholesome. Thus, Vaccha, these ten qualities are unwholesome, and these ten qualities are wholesome.\n\n### Accomplishments of the Disciples\n\nVaccha, when a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, deprived of the conditions for future arising, he becomes an arahant, one whose taints are exhausted, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, exhausted the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through final knowledge.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama. Is there, Venerable Gotama, even one bhikkhu among your disciples who, by the wearing away of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, the liberation by wisdom, and abides in it?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but many more bhikkhus who are my disciples have, through the wearing away of the taints, realized for themselves, with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and abide in it.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus. Is there even one bhikkhun\u012b among your disciples who, by the destruction of the taints, has realized for herself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and abides in it?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the bhikkhun\u012bs who are my disciples, who, by the destruction of the taints, have realized for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and abide in it.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhun\u012bs. Is there even one male lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibb\u0101na there, not returning to this world?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the male lay disciples who are my followers, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, have been spontaneously reborn, and will attain final Nibb\u0101na there, not returning to this world.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhun\u012bs, let it be with the male lay disciples, wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy. Is there even one male lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who has overcome doubt, free from confusion, self-assured and independent of others, and lives relying on the Teacher's instruction?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the male lay disciples who are my followers, wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, free from doubt, devoid of perplexity, who have gained confidence, and live relying on the Teacher's instruction.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhun\u012bs, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and enjoying sensual pleasures. Is there even one female lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibb\u0101na there, not returning to this world?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the female lay disciples who are my followers, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, have been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibb\u0101na there, not returning to this world.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhun\u012bs, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and enjoying sensual pleasures, let it be with the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy. Is there even one female lay disciple among your followers, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who is free from doubt, devoid of perplexity, gained confidence, and lives relying on the Teacher's instruction?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the female lay disciples who are my followers, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, free from doubt, devoid of perplexity, who have gained confidence, and live relying on the Teacher's instruction.\"\n\n\"If, Venerable Gotama, only you had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the bhikkhus, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you have accomplished this Dhamma, and the bhikkhus have also accomplished it, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.\n\nIf, Venerable Gotama, only you and the bhikkhus had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the bhikkhun\u012bs, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you have accomplished this Dhamma, the bhikkhus have also accomplished it, and the bhikkhun\u012bs have accomplished it, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhun\u012bs had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhun\u012bs, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhun\u012bs, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhun\u012bs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhun\u012bs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhun\u012bs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.\n\nIf, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhun\u012bs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhun\u012bs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.\n\nJust as, Venerable Gotama, the Ganges River inclines towards the ocean, flows towards the ocean, slopes towards the ocean, and reaches the ocean, in the same way, this assembly of yours, Venerable Gotama, including householders and those gone forth, inclines towards Nibb\u0101na, flows towards Nibb\u0101na, slopes towards Nibb\u0101na, and reaches Nibb\u0101na.\n\nExcellent, Venerable Gotama ... I go to Venerable Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sa\u1e45gha of bhikkhus. May I receive the going forth under Venerable Gotama, may I receive the full ordination.\n\n\"Vaccha, one who has previously followed another sect and wishes to go forth and receive full ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline must wait for four months. At the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they give him the going forth and the full ordination. However, I recognize individual differences in this matter.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, if those who have previously followed another sect and wish to go forth and receive full ordination in this Dhamma and discipline wait for four months, and at the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they give them the going forth and the full ordination, I will wait for four years. At the end of four years, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, let them give me the going forth and the full ordination.\" Vacchagotta the wanderer received the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One and received the full ordination.\n\nShortly after his ordination, within half a month, Venerable Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, to whatever extent higher knowledge and true understanding can be attained by a trainee, I have attained that. Let the Blessed One teach me further.\"\n\n### Three Knowledges\n\n\"Then, Vaccha, develop further the two qualities of tranquility and insight. For when these two qualities are developed further, they lead to the penetration of various states.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will experience various kinds of supernormal powers: being one, you will become many; being many, you will become one; you will appear and disappear; you will go unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as if through space; you will dive in and out of the earth as if it were water; you will walk on water without sinking as if it were earth; you will travel cross-legged through the sky like a bird with wings; you will touch and stroke with your hand even the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are; you will have power over your body as far as the Brahm\u0101 world. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will hear, with the divine ear element, purified and surpassing the human, both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will know the minds of other beings, other individuals, with your mind. You will understand a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind free of passion as a mind free of passion; a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind free of aversion as a mind free of aversion; a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind free of delusion as a mind free of delusion; a contracted mind as a contracted mind, and a distracted mind as a distracted mind; a developed mind as a developed mind, and an undeveloped mind as an undeveloped mind; a surpassable mind as a surpassable mind, and an unsurpassable mind as an unsurpassable mind; a collected mind as a collected mind, and an uncollected mind as an uncollected mind; a liberated mind as a liberated mind, and an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will recollect your manifold past lives, such as one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world contraction, many eons of world expansion, many eons of world contraction and expansion: 'There I was, named so-and-so, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my sustenance, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; and there too I was named so-and-so, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my sustenance, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus, with their aspects and particulars, you will recollect your manifold past lives. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, you will see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good destinations and bad destinations, and you will understand how beings are reborn according to their actions: 'These beings, indeed, endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, revilers of the noble ones, with wrong views, undertaking actions under the influence of wrong views, with the break-up of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell; but these beings, indeed, endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, not revilers of the noble ones, with right views, undertaking actions under the influence of right views, with the break-up of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, you will see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good destinations and bad destinations, and you will understand how beings are reborn according to their actions. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, by the wearing away of the taints, you will attain the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it for yourself with direct knowledge in this very life, and you will abide in it. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen Venerable Vacchagotta rejoiced and approved of the Blessed One's words. He rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.\n\nThen Venerable Vacchagotta, being alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute, soon realized for himself with direct knowledge in this very life that ultimate goal of the spiritual life, for the sake of which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.\n\nHe directly knew: \"Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the Arahants.\n\nAt that time, several bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed One. Venerable Vacchagotta saw them coming from afar. Seeing them, he went to meet them and said, \"Where are you venerable ones going?\"\n\n\"We are going to see the Blessed One, friend,\" they replied.\n\n\"Then, venerable ones, pay homage to the Blessed One on my behalf with your heads at his feet and say this: 'Venerable sir, Vacchagotta pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet and says, \"The Blessed One is fully served by me, the Blessed One is fully honored by me.\"'\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" those bhikkhus replied to Venerable Vacchagotta. Then they went to the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to him and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, Venerable Vacchagotta pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet and says, 'The Blessed One is fully served by me, the Blessed One is fully honored by me.'\"\n\n\"Even before, bhikkhus, I knew by mind that Vacchagotta the bhikkhu is endowed with the threefold knowledge, is mighty, and has great power. The deities also informed me: 'Venerable sir, Vacchagotta the bhikkhu is endowed with the threefold knowledge, is mighty, and has great power.'\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. Those bhikkhus were satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is the Worthy One, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in wisdom and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be trained, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'\n\nHe is endowed with experiential confidence in the teachings of the Buddha: 'Indeed, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, leading onward, to be personally experienced by the wise.'\n\nHe is endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha: 'Indeed, the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the knowledgeable way, practicing the proper way; these are the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals - this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.'\n\nHe is endowed with beloved noble virtues, unbroken, unblemished, unspotted, untarnished, leading to collectedness.\n\nThus, he is endowed with these four qualities.\n\nBhikkhus, the acquisition of the four continents cannot equal even a sixteenth part of the acquisition of these four qualities."}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:\n\n\"Just as, bhikkhus, this river Ganges might carry along a large lump of foam, a person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a lump of foam, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever form there is, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees it, reflects on it, and thoroughly examines it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it appears to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in form, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, during the autumn season when the sky is thick with clouds and it rains, bubbles form on the surface of the water. A person with good sight would see them, reflect on them, and thoroughly examine them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a water bubble, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever feelings there are, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees them, reflects on them, and thoroughly examines them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in feelings, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, during the last month of the hot season, at midday, a mirage shimmers. A person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a mirage, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever perceptions there are, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees them, reflects on them, and thoroughly examines them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in perceptions, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a man seeking heartwood, searching for the essence of heartwood, and on a quest for heartwood, taking a sharp axe, would enter the forest. There he would see a large banana tree, straight, young, and without a defect. He would cut it at the root; having cut it at the root, he would cut off the top; having cut off the top, he would peel away the outer sheaths. Peeling away the outer sheaths, he would not find even softwood, much less heartwood. A person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in the trunk of a banana tree, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever volitional formations there are, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees them, reflects on them, and thoroughly examines them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in volitional formations, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a magician or a magician's apprentice might display a magic trick at a crossroads. A person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a magic trick, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever consciousness there is, whether in the past, the future, and in the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees it, reflects on it, and thoroughly examines it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it appears to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in consciousness, bhikkhus?\n\nSeeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with form, grows disenchanted with feelings, grows disenchanted with perceptions, grows disenchanted with volitional formations, grows disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there is insight that he is liberated. He understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nThus spoke the Blessed One. Having said this, the Well-Gone one, the teacher, further said:\n\n\"Form is like a lump of foam,\nFeeling is like a water bubble;\nPerception is like a mirage,\nVolitional formations are like a banana tree;\nAnd consciousness is like a magic trick,\nSo taught the Kinsman of the Sun (an epithet of the Buddha).\n\nAs one reflects on them,\nThoroughly examines them;\nThey appear as empty, hollow, and without essence,\nTo one who sees them thus.\n\nThis body too, when comprehended\nBy the one with great wisdom;\nIs seen as having abandoned the three things (life, heat, and consciousness),\nForm as discarded.\n\nWhen life, heat, and consciousness\nDepart from this body;\nIt lies there thrown away,\nLike an inanimate thing discarded by others.\n\nSuch is the continuity of this illusion,\nA babble of children in a magic show;\nIt is described as a murderer,\nWith no essence to be found therein.\n\nThus should a bhikkhu contemplate the aggregates,\nWith energy aroused;\nBy day or by night,\nEver mindful and aware.\n\nOne should abandon all attachments,\nAnd make oneself one's own refuge;\nLiving as if one's head was on fire,\nAiming for the imperishable goal.\""}

Attaman\u0101 te bhikkh\u016b \u0101yasmato s\u0101riputtassa bh\u0101sita\u1e41 abhinandunti.", "output": "Thus have I heard \u2014 once, the Blessed One was dwelling at S\u0101vatthi in Jeta's Grove, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika's park. There, the Venerable S\u0101riputta addressed the bhikkhus: \"Friends, bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Friend\" - those bhikkhus responded to the Venerable S\u0101riputta. Venerable S\u0101riputta then said this:\n\n\"Just as, friends, the footprints of all jungle creatures are encompassed by the elephant's footprint, which is declared the largest due to its size; similarly, friends, all wholesome teachings are encompassed by the Four Noble Truths. Which four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'\n\nFriends, what is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair are suffering, as is not obtaining what one desires. In summary, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.\n\nWhich, friends, are the five aggregates subject to clinging? They are namely: the aggregate of form subject to clinging, the aggregate of feeling subject to clinging, the aggregate of perception subject to clinging, the aggregate of volitional formations subject to clinging, and the aggregate of consciousness subject to clinging.\n\nWhat, friends, is the aggregate of form subject to clinging? It consists of the four great elements and the forms dependent on these four great elements.\n\nWhat, friends, are the four great elements? They are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.\n\n#### Earth Element\n\nWhat, friends, is the earth element (solid state)? The earth element can be internal or external. What is the internal earth element? It is anything hard, solid, and clung to within the body, such as hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, and feces, or anything else that is internally hard, solid, and clung to. This is referred to as the internal earth element. Both the internal and external earth elements are simply the earth element. It should be seen with correct wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' By viewing it in this way, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nFriends, there comes a time when the external water element is disturbed, and during that time, the external earth element disappears. When the external earth element is seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to disappearance and change, what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am' (the root of conceit, comparison, ego).\n\nAnd if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution.\n\nNow, if others treat that bhikkhu with actions that are unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, through contact with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, he understands thus: This body is subject to contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives. But this has been said by the Blessed One in the 'advice on the simile of the saw'\":\n\n\"Bhikkhus, even if bandits were to savagely sever you limb by limb with a two-handled saw, anyone who would let his mind be overcome by hatred towards them would not be fulfilling my teaching.\" Therefore, tireless energy will be aroused in me, unwavering mindfulness established; my body shall remain tranquil and undisturbed, my mind concentrated and unified. Let contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives now disturb this body, for this is indeed the teaching of the Buddhas being practiced by me.\n\nWhen that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him, he arouses a sense of urgency thus: \"It is indeed a loss for me, not a gain; it is indeed bad for me, not good, that when I thus recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in me.\" Just as a daughter-in-law, upon seeing her father-in-law, arouses a sense of urgency to please him, so too, when that bhikkhu recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established, he arouses a sense of urgency. However, if equanimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him upon such recollection, then he is joyful and satisfied. By this, friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu.\n\n#### Water Element\n\nWhat, friends, is the water element (liquid state)? The water element can be internal or external. What is the internal water element? It is anything fluid and flowing within the body, clung to as part of one's identity, such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, snot, joint fluid, and urine, or any other internal substance that is fluid and flowing. This is referred to as the internal water element. Both the internal and external water elements are simply the water element. It should be seen with correct wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' By viewing it in this way, one becomes disenchanted with the water element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nThere is indeed a time, friends, when the external water element is disturbed. It sweeps through villages, towns, cities, regions, and entire countries. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, waters descend even to the extent of a hundred yojanas, two hundred yojanas, three hundred yojanas, four hundred yojanas, five hundred yojanas, six hundred yojanas, and seven hundred yojanas. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, the water stands only as high as seven palm trees, six palm trees, five palm trees, four palm trees, three palm trees, two palm trees, and even just as high as one palm tree. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, the water stands only as high as seven persons, six persons, five persons, four persons, three persons, two persons, and even just as high as one person. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, the water stands only as high as half a person, at waist level, at knee level, and at ankle level. There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean are not enough to wet even the joint of a finger. When even this external water element, great as it is, is seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to dissolution and change, what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am' (the root of conceit, comparison, ego). And if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution... Indeed, friends, by this much, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\n\n#### Fire Element\n\nWhat, friends, is the fire element? The fire element may be internal or external. What then is the internal fire element? It is whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to, such as that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets digested and assimilated. Or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to - this is called the internal fire element. Both the internal fire element and the external fire element are simply the fire element. It should be seen with correct wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' By seeing it in this way, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nNow, friends, there comes a time when the external fire element becomes disturbed. It burns up villages, towns, cities, districts, and even entire countries. The fire eventually extinguishes itself when it reaches green grass, a road, a rock, water, or a fair open space, due to lack of fuel. Friends, there comes a time when people resort to using a cock's feather or broken bits of tendon to make fire. When even this great external fire element is seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to dissolution and change, what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am'.\n\nAnd if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution... Indeed, friends, by this much, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\n\n#### Air Element\n\nFriends, what is the air element? The air element may be internal or external. What, friends, is the internal air element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to; that is, up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in the bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Both the internal air element and the external air element are just the air element. It should be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' Seeing it thus as it truly is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the air element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nNow, there comes a time when the external air element becomes unsettled. It powerfully moves through villages, towns, cities, regions, and even whole countries. There also comes a time in the last month of the hot season when people try to generate wind with fans or bellows, but even the tiny pieces of straw hanging from the edges of roofs don't move. When this great external air element itself, as vast and powerful as it is, can be clearly seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to dissolution and change, then what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am'.\n\nAnd if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution.\n\nNow, if others treat that bhikkhu with actions that are unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, through contact with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, he understands thus: This body is subject to contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives. But this has been said by the Blessed One in the 'advice on the simile of the saw'\": \"Bhikkhus, even if bandits were to savagely sever you limb by limb with a two-handled saw, anyone who would let his mind be overcome by hatred towards them would not be fulfilling my teaching.\" Therefore, tireless energy will be aroused in me, unwavering mindfulness established; my body shall remain tranquil and undisturbed, my mind concentrated and unified. Let contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives now disturb this body, for this is indeed the teaching of the Buddhas being practiced by me.\n\nWhen that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him, he arouses a sense of urgency thus: \"It is indeed a loss for me, not a gain; it is indeed bad for me, not good, that when I thus recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in me.\" Just as a daughter-in-law, upon seeing her father-in-law, arouses a sense of urgency to please him, so too, when that bhikkhu recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established, he arouses a sense of urgency. However, if equanimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him upon such recollection, then he is joyful and satisfied. By this, friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu.\n\nFriends, just as a space surrounded by wood, creepers, grass, and clay is simply considered a house; similarly, friends, a form surrounded by bones, tendons, flesh, and skin is simply recognized as a body.\n\nIf, friends, the eye is unimpaired and external forms do not come into its range, and there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case, the arising of the consciousness associated with sight does not occur. If, friends, the eye is unimpaired and external forms come into its range, but there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case too, the arising of the consciousness associated with sight does not occur. However, friends, when the eye is unimpaired, external forms come into its range, and there is corresponding mental engagement, then the arising of the consciousness associated with sight occurs.\n\nThe form that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of form subject to clinging. The feeling that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of feeling subject to clinging. The perception that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of perception subject to clinging. The volitional formations that are thus understood belong to the aggregate of volitional formations subject to clinging. The consciousness that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of consciousness subject to clinging.\n\nHe understands thus: 'Indeed, this is how the gathering, assembly, and coalescence of these five aggregates subject to clinging occur. The Blessed One has indeed said: 'One who sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma; one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent co-arising.' These five aggregates subject to clinging are indeed arisen through dependent co-arising. Desire, attachment, inclination, and holding on to these five aggregates subject to clinging is the origin of suffering. The removal and abandonment of desire and attachment in these five aggregates subject to clinging is the cessation of suffering.' By this much also, friends, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\n\nIf, friends, the internal ear \u2026 nose \u2026 tongue \u2026 body \u2026 mind is unimpaired, and mental experiences do not come into their range, and there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case, the arising of the consciousness associated with them does not occur.\n\nHowever, friends, if the internal mind is unimpaired, and mental experiences come into its range, but there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case too, the arising of the consciousness associated with the mind does not occur. But when, friends, the internal mind is unimpaired, mental experiences come into its range, and there is corresponding mental engagement, then the arising of the consciousness associated with the mind occurs.\n\nThe form thus experienced is included in the aggregate of form subject to clinging. The feeling thus experienced is included in the aggregate of feeling subject to clinging. The perception thus experienced is included in the aggregate of perception subject to clinging. The volitional formations thus experienced are included in the aggregate of volitional formations subject to clinging. The consciousness thus experienced is included in the aggregate of consciousness subject to clinging. He thus understands: 'Indeed, this is the gathering, assembly, and coalescence of these five aggregates subject to clinging.'\n\nThe Blessed One has indeed said: 'One who sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma; one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent co-arising.' These five aggregates subject to clinging are indeed arisen through dependent co-arising. Desire, attachment, inclination, and involvement in these five aggregates subject to clinging is the origin of suffering. The removal and abandonment of desire and attachment in these five aggregates subject to clinging is the cessation of suffering.' By this much also, friends, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\"\n\nThis was said by the Venerable S\u0101riputta. The bhikkhus rejoiced in and approved of Venerable S\u0101riputta's words."}

Then D\u012bgh\u0101vu addressed his father, the householder Jotika, saying, \"Please, householder, go to the Blessed One, and in my name, bow down with your head at his feet and say: 'Venerable sir, D\u012bgh\u0101vu, the lay follower, is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. He bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet.' And also say, 'It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would come to the dwelling of D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower, out of compassion.'\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" replied the householder Jotika to D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower, and he went to the Blessed One. Having approached, he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side. Sitting there, the householder Jotika addressed the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, D\u012bgh\u0101vu, the lay follower, is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. He bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet. And he also says, 'It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would come to the dwelling of D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower, out of compassion.'\" The Blessed One consented in silence.\n\nThen the Blessed One, after putting on his robe and taking his bowl and outer robe, went to the dwelling of D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat. Sitting there, the Blessed One addressed D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower: \"Is it bearable for you, D\u012bgh\u0101vu? Is it manageable for you? Are your painful feelings decreasing, not increasing? Is their subsiding, not their intensifying, discernible?\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, it is not bearable for me, it is not manageable for me. My painful feelings are increasing, not decreasing. Their intensifying, not their subsiding, is discernible.\"\n\n\"Therefore, D\u012bgh\u0101vu, you should train yourself thus: 'I will be endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha \u2014 thus indeed is the Blessed One: an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One. I will be endowed with experiential confidence in the Dhamma... I will be endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha... I will be endowed with the virtues loved by the noble ones \u2014 unbroken, unblemished, unspotted, untarnished, leading to collectedness.' Thus should you train yourself, D\u012bgh\u0101vu.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, the four factors of stream-entry taught by the Blessed One are found in me, and I am found among them. Venerable sir, I am endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha \u2014 thus indeed is the Blessed One: an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be trained, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One. I am endowed with experiential confidence in the Dhamma... I am endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha... I am endowed with the virtues loved by the noble ones \u2014 unbroken, unblemished, unspotted, untarnished, leading to collectedness.\"\n\n\"Therefore, D\u012bgh\u0101vu, based on these four factors of stream-entry, you should further develop the six factors conducive to true knowledge. Here, D\u012bgh\u0101vu, you should dwell contemplating impermanence in all conditions, perceiving discontentment in what is impermanent, perceiving non-self in what is discontented, perceiving abandoning, perceiving dispassion, and perceiving ending. Thus should you train yourself, D\u012bgh\u0101vu.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, the six factors conducive to true knowledge taught by the Blessed One are found in me, and I am found among them. Venerable sir, I dwell contemplating impermanence in all conditions, perceiving discontentment in what is impermanent, perceiving non-self in what is discontented, perceiving abandoning, perceiving dispassion, and perceiving ending.\"\n\n\"However, venerable sir, it occurs to me: 'Let not the householder Jotika fall into grief upon my passing.'\" \"Do not think that way, dear D\u012bgh\u0101vu. Rather, remember what I have taught you, and focus your mind on it well.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having given this exhortation to D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower, rose from his seat and departed. Soon after the Blessed One had left, D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower passed away. Then several bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, bowed down to him, and sat to one side. Sitting there, the bhikkhus addressed the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, the lay follower named D\u012bgh\u0101vu, who was exhorted by the Blessed One with a brief exhortation, has passed away. What is his destination, what is his future state?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower was wise. He practiced in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me with technical points about the teaching. By the destruction of the five lower fetters, D\u012bgh\u0101vu the lay follower has been reborn spontaneously and will attain final Nibb\u0101na there, without ever returning to this world.\"\n\nThis is the third."}

After paying respects to the Blessed One, they sat down to one side. Once seated, the preceptor said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, this bhikkhu says: 'At present, I feel as if my body is intoxicated, the directions seem unclear to me, the teachings do not spring to mind, complacency completely occupies my mind, I do not find enjoyment in the spiritual life, and I have doubts about the teachings.'\"\n\nThe Blessed One replied: \"Indeed, bhikkhu, this happens when 1) one is not guarded in the sense faculties, 2) not applying moderation in eating, 3) not dedicated to wakefulness, 4) lacks insight into wholesome qualities, and 5) does not engage in the development of the awakening factors during the first and last watch of the night. As a result, the body feels as if intoxicated, the directions seem unclear, the teachings do not spring to mind, complacency completely occupies the mind, one does not find enjoyment in the spiritual life, and doubts about the teachings arise.\n\nTherefore, bhikkhu, you should train yourself thus: 'I will be guarded in the sense faculties, apply moderation in eating, be dedicated to wakefulness, develop insight into wholesome qualities, and engage in the development of the awakening factors during the first and last watch of the night.' This is how you should train yourself.\"\n\nThen, that bhikkhu, having been instructed by the Blessed One with this advice, rose from his seat, paid respects to the Blessed One, circumambulated him to the right, and departed.\n\nThereafter, that bhikkhu, living in seclusion, with diligence, continuous effort, and resoluteness, not long after, realized by personal knowledge and attained in that very life the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.\n\nHe understood: \"Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" And that bhikkhu became one among the arahants.\n\nThen that bhikkhu, having attained arahantship, approached his preceptor and said: \"Venerable sir, at present my body no longer feels as if intoxicated, the directions are clear to me, the teachings spring to mind, complacency no longer occupies my mind, I find enjoyment in the spiritual life, and I have no doubts about the teachings.\"\n\nThen, taking his pupil with him, the preceptor approached the Blessed One.

Then, in the morning, having dressed and taken his bowl and robe, he entered S\u0101vatthi for alms. Having wandered for alms in S\u0101vatthi and after the meal, having returned from his alms gathering, he approached the Dark Forest for the day's abiding. Having entered the Dark Forest, he sat down at the root of a certain tree for the day's abiding.\n\nThen, in the evening, having emerged from seclusion, he approached Jeta's Grove, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika's park.

In what dwelling have you dwelled today, Venerable S\u0101riputta?\"\n\n\"Here, friend, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the first jh\u0101na, which includes thought and examination, with the joy and happiness born of seclusion. For me, friend, the experience was not characterized by thoughts such as 'I am entering the first jh\u0101na,' 'I have entered the first jh\u0101na,' or 'I have emerged from the first jh\u0101na.'\"\n\n\"Indeed, Venerable S\u0101riputta has long ago eradicated the underlying tendencies towards I-making, mine-making, and conceit. Therefore, for him, there is no such thought process as 'I am entering the first jh\u0101na,' 'I have entered the first jh\u0101na,' or 'I have emerged from the first jh\u0101na.'\""}
