After going on almsround in Vesāli and returning from his almsround after his meal, the Blessed One addressed Venerable Ānanda: \"Take your sitting mat, Ānanda. We shall go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day's abiding.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One, and taking his sitting mat, followed closely behind the Blessed One.\n\nThen the Blessed One went to the Cāpāla Shrine and, upon arrival, sat down on the prepared seat.

The Tathāgata, Ānanda, has developed and frequently practiced these four bases of psychic ability, mastered them, firmly established them, repeatedly practiced them, consolidated them, and resolutely undertaken them. If he so wished, Ānanda, the Tathāgata could live for an aeon or the remainder of an aeon.\"\n\nEven so, while the Blessed One was giving such a clear and evident sign, venerable Ānanda was unable to comprehend and did not beg the Blessed One, saying, 'May the Blessed One remain for an aeon, may the Blessed One remain for the benefit and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans,' because his mind was overwhelmed by Māra.\n\nA second time, the Blessed One ...

Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibbāna.\n\nThe Blessed One has also said: 'I will not attain final Nibbāna until my bhikkhunis are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it, until the Dhamma has been well proclaimed among gods and humans.'\n\nNow, venerable sir, there are bhikkhunis who are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it. Let the Fortunate One now attain final Nibbāna, let the Blessed One now attain final Nibbāna. Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibbāna.\n\nThe Blessed One has also said: 'I will not attain final Nibbāna until my male lay followers ... female lay followers are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it, until the Dhamma has been well proclaimed among gods and humans.'\n\nNow, venerable sir, there are male lay followers ... female lay followers who are established as distinguished in learning, trained, confident, very learned in the Dhamma, practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing rightly, conducting themselves properly, living according to the Dhamma, explaining it, teaching it, declaring it, establishing it, disclosing it, analyzing it, and explaining it. Let the Fortunate One now attain final Nibbāna, let the Blessed One now attain final Nibbāna. Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibbāna.\n\nThe Blessed One has also said: 'I will not attain final Nibbāna until this spiritual life has been well-established, well-developed, widespread, well-proclaimed, and well-established among gods and humans.' Now, venerable sir, this spiritual life has been well-established, well-developed, widespread, well-proclaimed, and well-established among gods and humans. Let the Fortunate One now attain final Nibbāna, let the Blessed One now attain final Nibbāna. Now is the time for the Blessed One's final Nibbāna.\"\n\nWhen this was said, the Blessed One addressed Māra the Evil One: \"Be at ease now, Māra. The Tathāgata's final Nibbāna will not be long delayed. Three months from now, the Tathāgata will attain final Nibbāna.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, mindful and fully aware, relinquished the life force at the Cāpāla Shrine. When the Blessed One had relinquished the life force, there was a great earthquake, terrifying and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then the Blessed One, understanding the significance of this moment, uttered this inspired utterance:\n\n\"Comparing both the comparable and the incomparable,\nThe sage relinquished the formations of continued existence;\nRejoicing within, mentally composed,\nHe shattered the armor of self-existence.\""}]}

You should scatter, demolish, and destroy feeling, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving. You should scatter, demolish, and destroy perception, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving. You should scatter, demolish, and destroy volitional formations, and make it unplayable by practicing for the wearing away of craving.

At that time, the venerable Khemaka was residing at the Jujube Tree Park, and he was sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill.\n\nThen, in the evening, those elder bhikkhus, having come out of seclusion, addressed the venerable Dāsaka: \"Come, friend Dāsaka, go to the bhikkhu Khemaka and speak to him thus: 'The elders, friend Khemaka, ask whether you are bearing up, whether you are enduring, whether your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and whether there is a sign of their subsiding and not increasing.'\"\n\n\"Yes, friends,\" the venerable Dāsaka replied to the elder bhikkhus, and he went to the venerable Khemaka. Having gone there, he spoke to the venerable Khemaka thus:\n\n\"The elders, friend Khemaka, ask whether you are bearing up, whether you are enduring, whether your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and whether there is a sign of their subsiding and not increasing.\"\n\n\"Friend, I am not bearing up, not enduring, my painful feelings are not subsiding but increasing, and there is no sign of their subsiding,\" replied Khemaka.\n\nThen the venerable Dāsaka returned to the elder bhikkhus and reported: \"Friend Khemaka said: 'I am not bearing up, not enduring, my painful feelings are not subsiding but increasing, and there is no sign of their subsiding.'\"\n\nThe elders said: \"Come, friend Dāsaka, go again to Khemaka and speak to him thus: 'The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. Do you, venerable Khemaka, regard any of these five aggregates as self or as belonging to self?'\"\n\n\"Yes, friends,\" Dāsaka replied to the elder bhikkhus and went again to Khemaka. Having gone there, he spoke to Khemaka as instructed: \"The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. Do you, venerable Khemaka, regard any of these five aggregates as self or as belonging to self?\"\n\n\"Friend, the Blessed One has indeed spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. In these five aggregates, I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self,\" replied Khemaka.\n\nThen the venerable Dāsaka returned to the elder bhikkhus and reported: \"Friend Khemaka said: 'The Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate. In these five aggregates, I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self.'\"\n\nThe elders said: \"Come, friend Dāsaka, go again to Khemaka and speak to him thus: 'The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate.

Having gone there, he spoke to Khemaka as instructed: \"The elders, friend Khemaka, say that the Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate.

In these five aggregates, I do not regard anything as self or as belonging to self, nor am I an arahant whose taints are exhausted. However, in these five aggregates, there remains the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency.\"\n\nThen the venerable Dāsaka returned to the elder bhikkhus and reported: \"Friend Khemaka said: 'The Blessed One has spoken of five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate, the feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the consciousness aggregate.

Do you mean that perception is 'I am,' or something other than perception? Do you mean that formations are 'I am,' or something other than formations? Do you mean that consciousness is 'I am,' or something other than consciousness? What exactly do you mean by saying, 'I am'?\"\n\n\"Yes, friends,\" Dāsaka replied to the elder bhikkhus and went again to Khemaka. Having gone there, he spoke to Khemaka as instructed: \"The elders, friend Khemaka, ask: What do you mean by saying, 'I am'? Do you mean that form is 'I am,' or do you mean something other than form?

Do you mean that formations are 'I am,' or something other than formations? Do you mean that consciousness is 'I am,' or something other than consciousness? What exactly do you mean by saying, 'I am'?\"\n\n\"Enough, friend Dāsaka, why this roundabout talk? Bring a staff; I will go to the elders myself,\" replied Khemaka.\n\nThen the venerable Khemaka took a staff and went to the elders. Having approached them, he exchanged greetings with the elder bhikkhus and, after a courteous conversation, sat down to one side.\n\nThe elder bhikkhus then asked him: \"What do you mean by saying, 'I am'? Do you mean that form is 'I am,' or do you mean something other than form? Do you mean that feeling is 'I am,' or something other than feeling? Do you mean that perception is 'I am,' or something other than perception? Do you mean that formations are 'I am,' or something other than formations? Do you mean that consciousness is 'I am,' or something other than consciousness? What exactly do you mean by saying, 'I am'?\"\n\n\"Friends, I do not say that form is 'I am,' nor that something other than form is 'I am.' I do not say that feeling is 'I am,' nor that something other than feeling is 'I am.' I do not say that perception is 'I am,' nor that something other than perception is 'I am.' I do not say that formations are 'I am,' nor that something other than formations is 'I am.' I do not say that consciousness is 'I am,' nor that something other than consciousness is 'I am.' However, in these five aggregates, there remains the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency.\"\n\n\"Friends, consider the scent of a lotus, water lily, or white lotus. If someone were to say, 'The scent belongs to the petals,' or 'The scent belongs to the color,' or 'The scent belongs to the stamens,' would they be correct?\"\n\n\"No, friend.\"\n\n\"Then, how, friend, would one rightly explain it?\"\n\n\"One would rightly explain, friend, 'It is the scent of the flower.'\"\n\n\"In the same way, friend, I do not say that form is 'I am,' nor do I say that something other than form is 'I am.' I do not say that feeling is 'I am,' nor that something other than feeling is 'I am.' I do not say that perception is 'I am,' nor that something other than perception is 'I am.' I do not say that formations are 'I am,' nor that something other than formations is 'I am.' I do not say that consciousness is 'I am,' nor that something other than consciousness is 'I am.' However, in these five aggregates subject to clinging, there remains the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency.\"\n\n\"Friend, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, still the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency remains. Over time, he contemplates the arising and passing away of the five aggregates: 'Such is form, such is the arising of form, such is the passing away of form; such is feeling, such is the arising of feeling, such is the passing away of feeling; such is perception, such is the arising of perception, such is the passing away of perception; such are formations, such is the arising of formations, such is the passing away of formations; such is consciousness, such is the arising of consciousness, such is the passing away of consciousness.' Contemplating thus, the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency is fully eradicated.\"\n\n\"Just as, friend, a cloth that is soiled and stained with dirt is given by its owners to a washer. The washer, having rubbed it with saline cleaning salt, lye, or cow dung, washes it clean in water. Even though the cloth becomes clean and bright, a residual odor of saline cleaning salt, lye, or cow dung may remain. The washer then returns the cloth to the owners, who store it in a fragrant box. Whatever residual odor remains, eventually, that too disappears.\"\n\n\"In the same way, friend, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, still the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency remains. Over time, he contemplates the arising and passing away of the five aggregates: 'Such is form, such is the arising of form, such is the passing away of form; such is feeling, such is the arising of feeling, such is the passing away of feeling; such is perception, such is the arising of perception, such is the passing away of perception; such are formations, such is the arising of formations, such is the passing away of formations; such is consciousness, such is the arising of consciousness, such is the passing away of consciousness.' Contemplating thus, the 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, and 'I am' underlying tendency is fully eradicated.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus, the elder bhikkhus said to the venerable Khemaka: \"Friend Khemaka, we did not ask you these questions to trouble you, but because you are capable of explaining, teaching, establishing, revealing, analyzing, and elucidating the Blessed One's teaching in detail. And this, venerable Khemaka, you have done: you have explained, taught, established, revealed, analyzed, and elucidated the Blessed One's teaching in detail.\"\n\nThe venerable Khemaka spoke these words, and the elder bhikkhus rejoiced in the venerable Khemaka's words. As this discourse was being given, the minds of sixty elder bhikkhus were liberated from the taints without grasping, including that of the venerable Khemaka."}]}

Attamano āyasmā rāhulo bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinandīti."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ambalaṭṭhikarāhulovāda sutta\nThus have I heard - At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.\n\nNow at that time, the venerable Rāhula was dwelling at Ambalaṭṭhika. Then the Blessed One, having arisen from seclusion in the evening time, approached Ambalaṭṭhika, where the venerable Rāhula was. The venerable Rāhula saw the Blessed One approaching from afar. Having seen him, he prepared a seat and water for his feet. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down, he washed his feet. The venerable Rāhula also, having paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side.\n\n### An Intentional Lie\n\nThen the Blessed One placed a small amount of leftover water in the water vessel and addressed the venerable Rāhula: \"Rāhula, do you see this small amount of leftover water in the water vessel?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Even so little, Rāhula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having discarded the small amount of leftover water, addressed the venerable Rāhula: \"Do you see this small amount of leftover water discarded, Rāhula?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Thus, discarded, Rāhula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having overturned that water vessel, addressed the venerable Rāhula: \"Do you see this overturned water vessel, Rāhula?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Thus overturned, Rāhula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having turned the water vessel upright, addressed the venerable Rāhula: \"Rāhula, do you see this hollow and empty water vessel?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Even so hollow and empty, Rāhula, is the asceticism of those who do not feel shame in telling an intentional lie.\"\n\n#### Simile Of The King's Elephant\n\n\"Just as, Rāhula, a king's elephant with sharp tusks, of a mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, acts with his front body, acts with his hind body, acts with his head, acts with his ears, acts with his tusks, acts with his tail; however, he protects his trunk. Then his rider would think: 'This king's elephant with sharp tusks, mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, and acts with his tail; however, it protects his trunk. He has not yet given up his life.'\n\nWhen, Rāhula, a king's elephant with sharp tusks, mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, acts with his front body, acts with his hind body, acts with his head, acts with his ears, acts with his tusks, acts with his tail, and acts with his trunk, then his rider would think: 'This king's elephant with sharp tusks, mighty stature, well bred, accustomed to the battlefield, engaged in battle, acts with his front feet, acts with his hind feet, acts with his front body, acts with his hind body, acts with his head, acts with his ears, acts with his tusks, acts with his tail, and acts with his trunk. He has given up his life. Now there is nothing that the king's elephant will not do.'\n\nJust so, Rāhula, for anyone who does not feel shame in telling an intentional lie, there is no evil that they will not do, I say. Therefore, Rāhula, you should train yourself thus: 'I will not tell an intentional lie even as a joke.'

If, Rāhula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I intend to do would lead to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This is an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then such a bodily action, Rāhula, should not be done by you.

If, Rāhula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I did led to my own harm, or to the harm of others, or to the harm of both. This was an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, resulting in suffering,' then such a bodily action should be confessed to the teacher, to the wise, or to fellow practitioners. It should be revealed, it should be openly declared. Having confessed, revealed, and openly declared it, restraint should be undertaken in the future. If, however, Rāhula, reflecting thus, you would know: 'This bodily action I did would neither lead to my own harm, nor to the harm of others, nor to the harm of both.

And whatever ascetics or brahmins at present purify their bodily actions, purify their verbal actions, and purify their mental actions, they all do so by repeatedly reflecting thus: by reflecting thus, they purify their bodily actions; by reflecting thus, they purify their verbal actions; by reflecting thus, they purify their mental actions. Therefore, Rāhula, you should train yourself thus: 'I will purify my bodily actions by reflecting repeatedly; I will purify my verbal actions by reflecting repeatedly; I will purify my mental actions by reflecting repeatedly.' This is how you should train yourself, Rāhula.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. Satisfied, the venerable Rāhula rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

At that time, the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling in the village of Nālaka in Magadha, and he was sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. Cunda, the novice monk, was an attendant of the Venerable Sāriputta.\n\nThen the Venerable Sāriputta attained final Nibbāna from that very illness. Then Cunda, the novice monk, having taken the alms-bowl and robe of the Venerable Sāriputta, went to Sāvatthi, to the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park, to where the Venerable Ānanda was. Having approached, he paid respects to the Venerable Ānanda and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Cunda, the novice monk, said to the Venerable Ānanda:\n\n\"Venerable sir, Sāriputta has attained final Nibbāna. This is his alms-bowl and robe.\"\n\n\"Friend Cunda, this topic should be brought up with the Blessed One. Come, let us go to him and report it.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" Cunda, the novice monk, replied to the Venerable Ānanda.\n\nThen the Venerable Ānanda and Cunda, the novice monk, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid respects to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, this novice monk Cunda said: 'Venerable sir, Sāriputta has attained final Nibbāna; this is his alms-bowl and robe.' Moreover, venerable sir, I feel as if my body is intoxicated, the directions seem unclear to me, and the teachings do not spring to mind after hearing that 'the Venerable Sāriputta has attained final Nibbāna.'\"\n\nWhy, Ānanda, when Sāriputta attained final Nibbāna, did he take away your aggregate of virtue, your aggregate of collectedness, your aggregate of wisdom, your aggregate of liberation, or your aggregate of the knowledge and vision of liberation?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir, he did not take my aggregate of virtue, or my aggregate of concentration, or my aggregate of wisdom, or my aggregate of liberation, or my aggregate of knowledge and vision of liberation. However, venerable sir, the Venerable Sāriputta was an advisor, one who instilled understanding, explained, demonstrated, encouraged, inspired, and uplifted. He was tireless in teaching the Dhamma and supportive to fellow practitioners. We remember the essence of the Dhamma, the wealth of the Dhamma, and the support of the Dhamma given by the Venerable Sāriputta.\"\n\n\"But have I not already declared, Ānanda, that we must be parted, separated, and severed from all who are dear and agreeable to us? How, Ānanda, can it be obtained: 'May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!'? That is impossible.\n\nJust as, Ānanda, a great tree standing sound and possessing heartwood might have its largest branch break off, so too, Ānanda, in the great Bhikkhu Saṅgha standing sound and possessing heartwood, Sāriputta has attained final Nibbāna.\n\nHow, Ānanda, can it be obtained here: 'May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!'? That is impossible.\n\nTherefore, Ānanda, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge.\n\nAnd how, Ānanda, does a bhikkhu dwell as an island unto himself, with himself as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge, with the Dhamma as his island, with the Dhamma as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in the body, with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having removed craving and aversion (dissatisfaction) regarding the world. Similarly, he dwells observing feelings in feelings, the mind in the mind, and mental qualities in mental qualities, with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having removed craving and aversion regarding the world.\n\nThis is how, Ānanda, a bhikkhu dwells as an island unto himself, with himself as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge, with the Dhamma as his island, with the Dhamma as his refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge.\n\nWhoever, Ānanda, now or after my passing, dwells as an island unto themselves, with themselves as their own refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge; with the Dhamma as their island, with the Dhamma as their refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge; they, Ānanda, will be the foremost of those who are keen on the training.\""}]}

Attamanā te bhikkhū āyasmato sāriputtassa bhāsitaṁ abhinandunti."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mahāhatthipadopama sutta\nThus have I heard — once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. There, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: \"Friends, bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Friend\" - those bhikkhus responded to the Venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta then said this:\n\n\"Just as, friends, the footprints of all jungle creatures are encompassed by the elephant's footprint, which is declared the largest due to its size; similarly, friends, all wholesome teachings are encompassed by the Four Noble Truths. Which four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'\n\nFriends, what is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair are suffering, as is not obtaining what one desires. In summary, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.\n\nWhich, friends, are the five aggregates subject to clinging? They are namely: the aggregate of form subject to clinging, the aggregate of feeling subject to clinging, the aggregate of perception subject to clinging, the aggregate of volitional formations subject to clinging, and the aggregate of consciousness subject to clinging.\n\nWhat, friends, is the aggregate of form subject to clinging? It consists of the four great elements and the forms dependent on these four great elements.\n\nWhat, friends, are the four great elements? They are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.\n\n#### Earth Element\n\nWhat, friends, is the earth element (solid state)? The earth element can be internal or external. What is the internal earth element? It is anything hard, solid, and clung to within the body, such as hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, and feces, or anything else that is internally hard, solid, and clung to. This is referred to as the internal earth element. Both the internal and external earth elements are simply the earth element. It should be seen with correct wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' By viewing it in this way, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nFriends, there comes a time when the external water element is disturbed, and during that time, the external earth element disappears. When the external earth element is seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to disappearance and change, what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am' (the root of conceit, comparison, ego).\n\nAnd if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution.\n\nNow, if others treat that bhikkhu with actions that are unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, through contact with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, he understands thus: This body is subject to contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives. But this has been said by the Blessed One in the 'advice on the simile of the saw'\":\n\n\"Bhikkhus, even if bandits were to savagely sever you limb by limb with a two-handled saw, anyone who would let his mind be overcome by hatred towards them would not be fulfilling my teaching.\" Therefore, tireless energy will be aroused in me, unwavering mindfulness established; my body shall remain tranquil and undisturbed, my mind concentrated and unified. Let contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives now disturb this body, for this is indeed the teaching of the Buddhas being practiced by me.\n\nWhen that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him, he arouses a sense of urgency thus: \"It is indeed a loss for me, not a gain; it is indeed bad for me, not good, that when I thus recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in me.\" Just as a daughter-in-law, upon seeing her father-in-law, arouses a sense of urgency to please him, so too, when that bhikkhu recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established, he arouses a sense of urgency. However, if equanimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him upon such recollection, then he is joyful and satisfied. By this, friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu.\n\n#### Water Element\n\nWhat, friends, is the water element (liquid state)? The water element can be internal or external. What is the internal water element? It is anything fluid and flowing within the body, clung to as part of one's identity, such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, snot, joint fluid, and urine, or any other internal substance that is fluid and flowing. This is referred to as the internal water element. Both the internal and external water elements are simply the water element. It should be seen with correct wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' By viewing it in this way, one becomes disenchanted with the water element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nThere is indeed a time, friends, when the external water element is disturbed. It sweeps through villages, towns, cities, regions, and entire countries. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, waters descend even to the extent of a hundred yojanas, two hundred yojanas, three hundred yojanas, four hundred yojanas, five hundred yojanas, six hundred yojanas, and seven hundred yojanas. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, the water stands only as high as seven palm trees, six palm trees, five palm trees, four palm trees, three palm trees, two palm trees, and even just as high as one palm tree. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, the water stands only as high as seven persons, six persons, five persons, four persons, three persons, two persons, and even just as high as one person. There is, friends, a time when in the great ocean, the water stands only as high as half a person, at waist level, at knee level, and at ankle level. There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean are not enough to wet even the joint of a finger. When even this external water element, great as it is, is seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to dissolution and change, what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am' (the root of conceit, comparison, ego). And if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution... Indeed, friends, by this much, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\n\n#### Fire Element\n\nWhat, friends, is the fire element? The fire element may be internal or external. What then is the internal fire element? It is whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to, such as that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets digested and assimilated. Or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to - this is called the internal fire element. Both the internal fire element and the external fire element are simply the fire element. It should be seen with correct wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' By seeing it in this way, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nNow, friends, there comes a time when the external fire element becomes disturbed. It burns up villages, towns, cities, districts, and even entire countries. The fire eventually extinguishes itself when it reaches green grass, a road, a rock, water, or a fair open space, due to lack of fuel. Friends, there comes a time when people resort to using a cock's feather or broken bits of tendon to make fire. When even this great external fire element is seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to dissolution and change, what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am'.\n\nAnd if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution... Indeed, friends, by this much, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\n\n#### Air Element\n\nFriends, what is the air element? The air element may be internal or external. What, friends, is the internal air element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to; that is, up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in the bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Both the internal air element and the external air element are just the air element. It should be seen with proper wisdom as it truly is: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.' Seeing it thus as it truly is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the air element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards it.\n\nNow, there comes a time when the external air element becomes unsettled. It powerfully moves through villages, towns, cities, regions, and even whole countries. There also comes a time in the last month of the hot season when people try to generate wind with fans or bellows, but even the tiny pieces of straw hanging from the edges of roofs don't move. When this great external air element itself, as vast and powerful as it is, can be clearly seen to be impermanent, subject to wearing away, and liable to dissolution and change, then what of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no considering that as 'I am this' or 'this is mine' or 'I am'.\n\nAnd if others insult, abuse, provoke, or harass a bhikkhu, he understands that this painful feeling has arisen from sensory contact and is dependent on it, not independent. He perceives contact, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness as impermanent. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution. His mind, focusing solely on the element as its object, acquires clarity, steadiness, and resolution.\n\nNow, if others treat that bhikkhu with actions that are unwished for, undesired, and disagreeable, through contact with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, he understands thus: This body is subject to contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives. But this has been said by the Blessed One in the 'advice on the simile of the saw'\": \"Bhikkhus, even if bandits were to savagely sever you limb by limb with a two-handled saw, anyone who would let his mind be overcome by hatred towards them would not be fulfilling my teaching.\" Therefore, tireless energy will be aroused in me, unwavering mindfulness established; my body shall remain tranquil and undisturbed, my mind concentrated and unified. Let contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives now disturb this body, for this is indeed the teaching of the Buddhas being practiced by me.\n\nWhen that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in him, he arouses a sense of urgency thus: \"It is indeed a loss for me, not a gain; it is indeed bad for me, not good, that when I thus recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established in me.\" Just as a daughter-in-law, upon seeing her father-in-law, arouses a sense of urgency to please him, so too, when that bhikkhu recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become established, he arouses a sense of urgency. However, if equanimity supported by the wholesome becomes established in him upon such recollection, then he is joyful and satisfied. By this, friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu.\n\nFriends, just as a space surrounded by wood, creepers, grass, and clay is simply considered a house; similarly, friends, a form surrounded by bones, tendons, flesh, and skin is simply recognized as a body.\n\nIf, friends, the eye is unimpaired and external forms do not come into its range, and there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case, the arising of the consciousness associated with sight does not occur. If, friends, the eye is unimpaired and external forms come into its range, but there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case too, the arising of the consciousness associated with sight does not occur. However, friends, when the eye is unimpaired, external forms come into its range, and there is corresponding mental engagement, then the arising of the consciousness associated with sight occurs.\n\nThe form that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of form subject to clinging. The feeling that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of feeling subject to clinging. The perception that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of perception subject to clinging. The volitional formations that are thus understood belong to the aggregate of volitional formations subject to clinging. The consciousness that is thus understood belongs to the aggregate of consciousness subject to clinging.\n\nHe understands thus: 'Indeed, this is how the gathering, assembly, and coalescence of these five aggregates subject to clinging occur. The Blessed One has indeed said: 'One who sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma; one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent co-arising.' These five aggregates subject to clinging are indeed arisen through dependent co-arising. Desire, attachment, inclination, and holding on to these five aggregates subject to clinging is the origin of suffering. The removal and abandonment of desire and attachment in these five aggregates subject to clinging is the cessation of suffering.' By this much also, friends, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\n\nIf, friends, the internal ear … nose … tongue … body … mind is unimpaired, and mental experiences do not come into their range, and there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case, the arising of the consciousness associated with them does not occur.\n\nHowever, friends, if the internal mind is unimpaired, and mental experiences come into its range, but there is no corresponding mental engagement, then, in that case too, the arising of the consciousness associated with the mind does not occur. But when, friends, the internal mind is unimpaired, mental experiences come into its range, and there is corresponding mental engagement, then the arising of the consciousness associated with the mind occurs.\n\nThe form thus experienced is included in the aggregate of form subject to clinging. The feeling thus experienced is included in the aggregate of feeling subject to clinging. The perception thus experienced is included in the aggregate of perception subject to clinging. The volitional formations thus experienced are included in the aggregate of volitional formations subject to clinging. The consciousness thus experienced is included in the aggregate of consciousness subject to clinging. He thus understands: 'Indeed, this is the gathering, assembly, and coalescence of these five aggregates subject to clinging.'\n\nThe Blessed One has indeed said: 'One who sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma; one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent co-arising.' These five aggregates subject to clinging are indeed arisen through dependent co-arising. Desire, attachment, inclination, and involvement in these five aggregates subject to clinging is the origin of suffering. The removal and abandonment of desire and attachment in these five aggregates subject to clinging is the cessation of suffering.' By this much also, friends, a bhikkhu has accomplished much.\"\n\nThis was said by the Venerable Sāriputta. The bhikkhus rejoiced in and approved of Venerable Sāriputta's words."}]}

recount the urgency of awakening,\nas it has profoundly stirred within me.\n\nSeeing beings floundering,\nlike fish in shallow water;\nSeeing them obstructed by one another,\nfear overcame me.\n\nThe world is completely essence-less,\nall directions are unsettled;\nDesiring a sanctuary for myself,\nI saw no place secure.\n\nIndeed, at the ultimate impasse,\nunderstanding the obstruction, discontent arose in me;\nHere then, I discerned the dart,\nhard to perceive and lodged deep within the heart.\n\nAfflicted by that dart,\nmy mind raced in all directions;\nUpon extracting that very dart,\nI neither fled nor faltered.\n\nIn that regard, trainings are praised,\nThose which are highly esteemed in the world,\nOne should not be engrossed in them;\nHaving fully penetrated all sense-desires,\nOne should train for one's own liberation (Nibbāna).\n\nOne should be truthful, humble,\nstraightforward, and free from deceit or slander;\nWithout anger, free from greed\nthe sage overcomes these impurities.\n\nOne should dwell free of sleepiness, fatigue, and dullness,\nnot dwell in negligence;\nOne should continue without self-importance,\nwith a mind inclined towards Nibbāna.\n\nDo not be misled by falsehood,\nnor cultivate attachment to mere appearances;\nFully understand conceit,\nand conduct oneself without impulsiveness.\n\nDo not delight in the old,\nnor seek comfort in the new;\nDo not grieve for what is declining,\nand do not become bound by craving.\n\nGreed, I say, is the great flood,\nlonging, a swift and sweeping current;\nThe forming of intentions, the compulsion,\nthe mire of sense-desires is difficult to escape.\n\nThe sage, not deviating from the truth,\nstands firmly on the ground;\nhaving relinquished all,\nhe is indeed called 'peaceful'.\n\nIndeed, he who is wise and has perfect knowledge,\nhaving understood the Dhamma, they are independent;\nrightly he conducts himself in the world,\ndesiring nothing from anyone.\n\nOne who has crossed beyond sense-desires,\nthe bond in the world so hard to surmount;\nhe neither grieves nor resents,\nhaving crossed the stream, he is unbound.\n\nWhat was before, let it wither away,\nlet there be nothing after;\nif you grasp not at the middle,\nyou will live in peace.\n\nIn all of name-and-form,\nfor whom there is no 'mine-making' (cherishing);\nDoes not grieve for that which is not,\nsuch a one suffers no loss in the world.\n\nFor whom there is no 'this is mine',\nnor anything belonging to others;\nFinding no 'mine-ness',\nhe does not grieve, saying 'nothing is mine'.\n\nWithout harshness, without greed,\nwithout impulses, equal towards all;\nI declare these benefits,\nWhen asked about the unwavering one.\n\nFor the one knowing the unperturbed,\nthere are no volitional formations at all;\nNot engaging in new ventures,\nhe sees safety everywhere.\n\nNeither in equal nor in unequal,\nNor in the superior does the sage speak;\nPeaceful, free from

Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after this friendly exchange, he sat down to one side. As he was seated to one side, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: \"For a long time, I have been a companion in discussion with venerable Gotama. It would be good if Venerable Gotama would teach me briefly about wholesome and unwholesome states.\"\n\n### Wholesome and Unwholesome States\n\n\"Vaccha, I can teach you about wholesome and unwholesome states briefly or in detail. Still, let me do so in brief. Listen and pay close attention, and I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, Venerable sir,\" the wanderer Vacchagotta replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Greed (lust, desire, attachment), Vaccha, is unwholesome; non-greed is wholesome. Aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment), Vaccha, is unwholesome; good-will (friendliness, loving-kindness) is wholesome. Delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification), Vaccha, is unwholesome; non-delusion is wholesome. Thus, Vaccha, these three qualities are unwholesome, and these three qualities are wholesome.\n\nKilling living beings, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from killing living beings is wholesome. Taking what is not given, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from taking what is not given is wholesome. Sexual misconduct, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from sexual misconduct is wholesome. False speech, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from false speech is wholesome. Malicious speech, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from malicious speech is wholesome. Harsh speech, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from harsh speech is wholesome. Idle chatter, Vaccha, is unwholesome; abstaining from idle chatter is wholesome. Craving, Vaccha, is unwholesome; contentment is wholesome. Ill-will, Vaccha, is unwholesome; non-ill-will is wholesome. Wrong view, Vaccha, is unwholesome; right view is wholesome. Thus, Vaccha, these ten qualities are unwholesome, and these ten qualities are wholesome.\n\n### Accomplishments of the Disciples\n\nVaccha, when a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, deprived of the conditions for future arising, he becomes an arahant, one whose taints are exhausted, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, exhausted the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through final knowledge.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama. Is there, Venerable Gotama, even one bhikkhu among your disciples who, by the wearing away of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, the liberation by wisdom, and abides in it?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but many more bhikkhus who are my disciples have, through the wearing away of the taints, realized for themselves, with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and abide in it.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus. Is there even one bhikkhunī among your disciples who, by the destruction of the taints, has realized for herself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and abides in it?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the bhikkhunīs who are my disciples, who, by the destruction of the taints, have realized for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and abide in it.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs. Is there even one male lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibbāna there, not returning to this world?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the male lay disciples who are my followers, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, have been spontaneously reborn, and will attain final Nibbāna there, not returning to this world.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs, let it be with the male lay disciples, wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy. Is there even one male lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who has overcome doubt, free from confusion, self-assured and independent of others, and lives relying on the Teacher's instruction?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the male lay disciples who are my followers, wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, free from doubt, devoid of perplexity, who have gained confidence, and live relying on the Teacher's instruction.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and enjoying sensual pleasures. Is there even one female lay disciple among your followers, wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibbāna there, not returning to this world?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the female lay disciples who are my followers, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, who, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, have been spontaneously reborn and will attain final Nibbāna there, not returning to this world.\"\n\n\"Let that be, Venerable Gotama, let it be with the bhikkhus, let it be with the bhikkhunīs, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy, let it be with the male lay disciples wearing white clothes and enjoying sensual pleasures, let it be with the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes and practicing celibacy. Is there even one female lay disciple among your followers, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, who is free from doubt, devoid of perplexity, gained confidence, and lives relying on the Teacher's instruction?\"\n\n\"No, Vaccha, not merely one hundred, nor two hundred, nor three, four, or five hundred, but far more, the female lay disciples who are my followers, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, fulfilling duties, receiving instructions, free from doubt, devoid of perplexity, who have gained confidence, and live relying on the Teacher's instruction.\"\n\n\"If, Venerable Gotama, only you had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the bhikkhus, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you have accomplished this Dhamma, and the bhikkhus have also accomplished it, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.\n\nIf, Venerable Gotama, only you and the bhikkhus had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the bhikkhunīs, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you have accomplished this Dhamma, the bhikkhus have also accomplished it, and the bhikkhunīs have accomplished it, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhunīs had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect. If, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.\n\nIf, Venerable Gotama, only you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, had accomplished this Dhamma, and not the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, then this spiritual life would not be complete in that aspect. But since, Venerable Gotama, you, the bhikkhus, the bhikkhunīs, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, the male lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, practicing celibacy, and the female lay disciples, householders wearing white clothes, enjoying sensual pleasures, have accomplished this Dhamma, thus this spiritual life is complete in that aspect.\n\nJust as, Venerable Gotama, the Ganges River inclines towards the ocean, flows towards the ocean, slopes towards the ocean, and reaches the ocean, in the same way, this assembly of yours, Venerable Gotama, including householders and those gone forth, inclines towards Nibbāna, flows towards Nibbāna, slopes towards Nibbāna, and reaches Nibbāna.\n\nExcellent, Venerable Gotama ... I go to Venerable Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. May I receive the going forth under Venerable Gotama, may I receive the full ordination.\n\n\"Vaccha, one who has previously followed another sect and wishes to go forth and receive full ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline must wait for four months. At the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they give him the going forth and the full ordination. However, I recognize individual differences in this matter.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, if those who have previously followed another sect and wish to go forth and receive full ordination in this Dhamma and discipline wait for four months, and at the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they give them the going forth and the full ordination, I will wait for four years. At the end of four years, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, let them give me the going forth and the full ordination.\" Vacchagotta the wanderer received the going forth in the presence of the Blessed One and received the full ordination.\n\nShortly after his ordination, within half a month, Venerable Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, to whatever extent higher knowledge and true understanding can be attained by a trainee, I have attained that. Let the Blessed One teach me further.\"\n\n### Three Knowledges\n\n\"Then, Vaccha, develop further the two qualities of tranquility and insight. For when these two qualities are developed further, they lead to the penetration of various states.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will experience various kinds of supernormal powers: being one, you will become many; being many, you will become one; you will appear and disappear; you will go unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as if through space; you will dive in and out of the earth as if it were water; you will walk on water without sinking as if it were earth; you will travel cross-legged through the sky like a bird with wings; you will touch and stroke with your hand even the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are; you will have power over your body as far as the Brahmā world. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will hear, with the divine ear element, purified and surpassing the human, both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will know the minds of other beings, other individuals, with your mind. You will understand a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind free of passion as a mind free of passion; a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind free of aversion as a mind free of aversion; a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind free of delusion as a mind free of delusion; a contracted mind as a contracted mind, and a distracted mind as a distracted mind; a developed mind as a developed mind, and an undeveloped mind as an undeveloped mind; a surpassable mind as a surpassable mind, and an unsurpassable mind as an unsurpassable mind; a collected mind as a collected mind, and an uncollected mind as an uncollected mind; a liberated mind as a liberated mind, and an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, you will recollect your manifold past lives, such as one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world contraction, many eons of world expansion, many eons of world contraction and expansion: 'There I was, named so-and-so, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my sustenance, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; and there too I was named so-and-so, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my sustenance, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus, with their aspects and particulars, you will recollect your manifold past lives. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, you will see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good destinations and bad destinations, and you will understand how beings are reborn according to their actions: 'These beings, indeed, endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, revilers of the noble ones, with wrong views, undertaking actions under the influence of wrong views, with the break-up of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell; but these beings, indeed, endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, not revilers of the noble ones, with right views, undertaking actions under the influence of right views, with the break-up of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, you will see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in good destinations and bad destinations, and you will understand how beings are reborn according to their actions. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen, Vaccha, as much as you wish, by the wearing away of the taints, you will attain the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it for yourself with direct knowledge in this very life, and you will abide in it. You will achieve direct knowledge of that, whenever there is an appropriate basis.\n\nThen Venerable Vacchagotta rejoiced and approved of the Blessed One's words. He rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.\n\nThen Venerable Vacchagotta, being alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute, soon realized for himself with direct knowledge in this very life that ultimate goal of the spiritual life, for the sake of which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.\n\nHe directly knew: \"Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the Arahants.\n\nAt that time, several bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed One. Venerable Vacchagotta saw them coming from afar. Seeing them, he went to meet them and said, \"Where are you venerable ones going?\"\n\n\"We are going to see the Blessed One, friend,\" they replied.\n\n\"Then, venerable ones, pay homage to the Blessed One on my behalf with your heads at his feet and say this: 'Venerable sir, Vacchagotta pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet and says, \"The Blessed One is fully served by me, the Blessed One is fully honored by me.\"'\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" those bhikkhus replied to Venerable Vacchagotta. Then they went to the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to him and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, Venerable Vacchagotta pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet and says, 'The Blessed One is fully served by me, the Blessed One is fully honored by me.'\"\n\n\"Even before, bhikkhus, I knew by mind that Vacchagotta the bhikkhu is endowed with the threefold knowledge, is mighty, and has great power. The deities also informed me: 'Venerable sir, Vacchagotta the bhikkhu is endowed with the threefold knowledge, is mighty, and has great power.'\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. Those bhikkhus were satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

Then Dīghajāṇu, a young Koliyan man, approached the Blessed One. Having approached and paid respects to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Sitting down to one side, Dīghajāṇu, the young Koliyan man, said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, we are householders who enjoy sensual pleasures live with children around us. We use sandalwood from Kāsi, wear garlands, perfumes, and ointments, and enjoy gold and money. Therefore, venerable sir, may the Blessed One teach us the Dhamma in such a way that it will lead to our benefit and happiness in this life and in the future life.\"\n\n### Benefit and Happiness in This Life\n\n\"Byagghapajja (epithet of the Koliyans), there are these four qualities that lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of good family in this life. What are these four?\n\nAccomplishment in initiative, accomplishment in protection, good friendship, and balanced livelihood.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in initiative? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family supports his livelihood through various occupations - whether by farming, trading, cow herding, archery, government service, serving the king, or other crafts. He is skillful and not lazy, endowed with investigation and examination, capable of completing and organizing. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in initiative.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in protection? Here, Byagghapajja, the wealth of a son of good family is acquired through initiative and persistence, accumulated through the strength of arms, earned by sweat, righteous and lawfully obtained. He maintains this wealth with protection and guarding, thinking: 'How can my wealth not be seized by authorities, not stolen by thieves, not burned by fire, not carried away by water, and not seized by unfriendly heirs?' This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in protection.\n\nWhat, Byagghapajja, is good friendship? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family, wherever he lives, whether in a village or a town, there, he should associate with householders or their sons, whether young or old with moral virtue, whether endowed with faith, virtue, generosity, and wisdom. He should stand with them, converse with them, and engage in discussions with them. He should emulate the faith of those endowed with faith, the virtue of those endowed with virtue, the generosity of those endowed with generosity, and the wisdom of those endowed with wisdom. This, Byagghapajja, is called good friendship.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is balanced livelihood? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family, knowing both his income and his expenses, sustains a balanced livelihood, neither overly extravagant nor too frugal: 'Thus my income will cover my expenses, and my expenses will not exceed my income.' Just as, Byagghapajja, a scale holder or a scale holder's apprentice, having taken up the scale, knows: 'It is lowered by this much, or it is raised by this much, in the same way, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family, knowing both his income and his expenses, sustains a balanced livelihood, neither overly extravagant nor too frugal: 'Thus my income will cover my expenses, and my expenses will not exceed my income.' If, Byagghapajja, this son of a good family, having a small income, lives extravagantly, people will say: 'This son of a good family devours his wealth like a fig tree parasite.' If, Byagghapajja, this son of a good family, having a large income, lives miserably, people will say: 'This son of a good family will die without enjoying his wealth, like one who dies of hunger despite having plenty.' But when, Byagghapajja, this son of a good family, knowing both his income and his expenses, sustains a balanced livelihood, neither overly extravagant nor too frugal: 'Thus my income will cover my expenses, and my expenses will not exceed my income.' This, Byagghapajja, is called balanced livelihood.\n\nThus, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four drains: being promiscuous, a drunkard, a gambler, and associating with bad friends, bad companions, and being influenced by bad people. Just as, Byagghapajja, a large pond has four inlets and four drains, if a person would block the inlets and open the drains; and if the rain does not fall properly, then, Byagghapajja, for that large pond, only decline can be expected, not growth; in the same way, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four drains: being a womanizer, a drunkard, a gambler, and associating with bad friends, bad companions, and being influenced by bad people.\n\n### Benefit and Happiness in the Future Life\n\nThus, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four inlets: not being a womanizer, not being a drunkard, not being a gambler, and having good friends, good companions, and being influenced by good people. Just as, Byagghapajja, a large pond has four inlets and four drains, if a person were to open the inlets and block the drains, and if the rain falls properly, then, Byagghapajja, for that large pond, growth can be expected, not decline; in the same way, Byagghapajja, for wealth that has been obtained, there are four inlets: not being a womanizer, not being a drunkard, not being a gambler, and having good friends, good companions, and being influenced by good people.\n\nIndeed, Byagghapajja, these four qualities lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of a good family in this life.\n\nByagghapajja, there are these four qualities that lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of a good family in the future life. Which four? Accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in ethical conduct, accomplishment in generosity, accomplishment in wisdom.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in faith? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family is endowed with faith, and has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant and perfectly awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide for trainable individuals, a teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in faith.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in ethical conduct? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family refrains from killing living beings, refrains from taking what is not given, refrains from sexual misconduct, refrains from false speech, and refrains from intoxicants leading to heedlessness. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in ethical conduct.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in generosity? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family lives at home with a mind free from the stain of stinginess, generous, open handed, enjoying relinquishment, responsive to requests, and joyful in sharing gifts. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in generosity.\n\nAnd what, Byagghapajja, is accomplishment in wisdom? Here, Byagghapajja, a son of a good family is wise, endowed with wisdom that discerns the arising and passing away (of phenomena), which is noble and penetrative, leading to the complete ending of discontentment. This, Byagghapajja, is called accomplishment in wisdom.\n\nIndeed, Byagghapajja, these four qualities lead to the benefit and happiness of a son of a good family in the future life.\n\n### Verse\n\nIndustrious in one's duties,\ndiligent and skillful;\nOne sustains a balanced livelihood\nand protects what is acquired.\n\nFaithful, endowed with virtue,\ngenerous and free from stinginess;\nAlways purifying the path,\nensuring safety in the future life.\n\nThus these eight qualities,\nfor the faithful householder;\nAre explained by the one who is truly named,\nto bring happiness in both respects.\n\nFor the benefit in this life,\nand for happiness in the future life;\nThis is how for a householder,\nmerit grows by generosity."}]}

At one time, the Blessed One was residing in Kosambi at Ghosita's park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Is there a method, bhikkhus, by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, can understand: 'I am a trainee,' and an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, can understand: 'I am an arahant'?\"\n\nThe bhikkhus replied, \"Our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, venerable sir, guided by the Blessed One, and have the Blessed One as their refuge. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One himself would clarify the meaning of this statement.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said: \"There is indeed a method, bhikkhus, by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, can understand: 'I am a trainee,' and an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, can understand: 'I am an arahant'.\n\nWhat is the method, bhikkhus, by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee'? Here, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu understands as it truly is: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.' This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee.'\n\nFurthermore, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu reflects thus: 'Is there any other ascetic or brahmin outside this teaching who teaches a doctrine so true and factual as the Blessed One?' He understands thus: 'There is no other ascetic or brahmin outside this teaching who teaches a doctrine so true and factual as the Blessed One.' This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee.'\"\n\nFurthermore, bhikkhus, a trainee bhikkhu understands the five faculties: the faculty of confidence (faith), the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness (concentration), and the faculty of wisdom. He knows their tendencies, highest points, fruits, and final goals. He does not experience them with the body but sees them clearly with wisdom. This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which a trainee bhikkhu, standing on the plane of a trainee, understands: 'I am a trainee.'\n\nWhat is the method, bhikkhus, by which an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, understands: 'I am an arahant'? Here, bhikkhus, an arahant bhikkhu understands the five faculties: the faculty of confidence, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. He knows their tendencies, highest points, fruits, and final goals. He experiences them with the body and sees them clearly with wisdom. This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, understands: 'I am an arahant.'\n\nFurthermore, bhikkhus, an arahant bhikkhu understands the six faculties: the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty, and the mind faculty. He knows that these six faculties will cease entirely and no new faculties will arise anywhere. This too, bhikkhus, is a method by which an arahant bhikkhu, standing on the plane of an arahant, understands: 'I am an arahant.'\""}]}

Then Sāḷha, Migāra's grandson, and Sāṇo, Sekhuniya's grandson, approached the venerable Nandaka. Having approached, they paid homage to the venerable Nandaka and sat down to one side. While seated to one side, the venerable Nandaka said to Sāḷha, Migāra's grandson:\n\n\"Come now, Sāḷha, do not [adhere merely] by tradition, by lineage, by rumor, by scripture, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by speculative reasoning, by acceptance of a view after thorough investigation, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because 'the ascetic is our revered teacher.' When you know for yourselves: 'These mental qualities are unwholesome; these mental qualities are blameworthy; these mental qualities are criticized by the wise; these mental qualities, when adopted and carried out, lead to harm and to suffering (discontentment, stress),' then you should abandon them.\n\nWhat do you think, Sāḷha, is there greed (passion, lust, desire, attachment)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means covetousness (wishing for/wanting/longing for with strong eagerness, yearning). Indeed, this covetous person, being greedy, might kill living beings, take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lie, and persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Sāḷha, is there aversion (hate, anger, resentment)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means ill-will. Indeed, this person filled with ill-will might kill living beings, take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lie, and persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Sāḷha, is there delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means ignorance (misapprehension of true reality). Indeed, this deluded person might kill living beings, take what is not given, engage in sexual misconduct, lie, and persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Sāḷha, are these mental qualities wholesome or unwholesome?\"\n\n\"Unwholesome, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Blameworthy or blameless?\"\n\n\"Blameworthy, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?\"\n\n\"Criticized by the wise, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Do they, when adopted and carried out, lead to harm and to suffering, or not?

Thus was it said, and this was the reason for saying it.\n\nCome now, Sāḷha, do not [adhere merely] by hearsay... When you know for yourselves: 'These mental qualities are wholesome, blameless, praised by the wise, and, when adopted and carried out, lead to welfare and to ease (bliss),' then you should practice and abide in them.\n\nWhat do you think, Sāḷha, is there non-greed?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means contentment. Indeed, this contented person does not kill living beings, does not take what is not given, does not engage in sexual misconduct, does not lie, and does not persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term welfare and ease (bliss).\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Sāḷha, is there non-aversion?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means good-will. Indeed, this person free from ill-will does not kill living beings, does not take what is not given, does not engage in sexual misconduct, does not lie, and does not persuade others to do likewise, which results in long-term welfare and ease (bliss).\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Sāḷha, is there non-delusion (presence of close examination and verification, due consideration)?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"I declare that this means knowing (clear apprehension of how things have come to be).

When you know for yourselves —\n\nthese mental qualities are wholesome, blameless, praised by the wise, and, when adopted and carried out, lead to long-term welfare and ease (bliss), then you should practice and abide in them.' Thus was it said, and this was the reason for saying it.\n\n\"Thus, Sāḷha, the noble disciple, having abandoned covetousness, ill-will, and delusion, being aware and mindful, dwells pervading one direction with a heart imbued with loving-kindness (good-will), similarly the second, similarly the third, similarly the fourth; thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a heart imbued with loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity, extensive, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without ill-will.\n\nHe thus understands: 'There is this, there is the inferior, there is the superior, and beyond this is liberation from the sphere of perception.' As he understands and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, from the taint of ignorance; in liberation, there arises the knowledge: 'It is liberated.'\n\n'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being,' he understands.\n\nThus he understands: 'Previously there was greed, which was unwholesome; now it is not present, thus it is wholesome; previously there was aversion... previously there was delusion, which was unwholesome; now it is not present, thus it is wholesome.' Thus, in this very life, he is content, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, living with a mental resemblance of the ultimate.\""}]}

Listen carefully, pay close attention, I will speak.\"\n\n\"So be it, venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"What, bhikkhus, is dependent co-arising? With birth as condition, bhikkhus, there is aging and death. Whether Tathāgatas arise or not, this property, this stability of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma, this conditionality, remains. The Tathāgata fully understands this and makes it known. Having fully understood, he reveals, teaches, proclaims, establishes, discloses, analyzes, and makes it clear, saying: 'See, bhikkhus, with birth as condition, there is aging and death.'\n\nWith continued existence as condition, there is birth… with clinging as condition, there is continued existence… with craving as condition, there is clinging…\n\nwith feeling as condition, there is craving… with contact as condition, there is feeling… with the six sense bases as condition, there is contact… with name-and-form as condition, there are the six sense bases…\n\nwith consciousness as condition, there is name-and-form…\n\nwith volitional formations as condition, there is consciousness… with ignorance as condition, there are volitional formations. Whether Tathāgatas arise or not, this property, this stability of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma, this conditionality, remains. The Tathāgata fully understands this and makes it known. Having fully understood, he reveals, teaches, proclaims, establishes, discloses, analyzes, and makes it clear, saying: 'See, bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition, there are volitional formations.' Thus, bhikkhus, such is the truth, the unerring, the not otherwise, the conditionality—this is called, bhikkhus, dependent co-arising.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, are the phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising? Aging and death, bhikkhus, are impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. Birth, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. continued existence, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. Clinging, bhikkhus… craving, bhikkhus…\n\nfeeling, bhikkhus… contact, bhikkhus… the six sense bases, bhikkhus… name-and-form, bhikkhus…\n\nconsciousness, bhikkhus…\n\nvolitional formations, bhikkhus… ignorance, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. These are called, bhikkhus, the phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple sees as they really are with correct wisdom this dependent co-arising and these phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising, then they will not run back into the past, thinking: 'Was I in the past, was I not in the past, what was I in the past, how was I in the past, having been what, what did I become in the past?' nor will they run forward into the future, thinking: 'Will I be in the future, will I not be in the future, what will I be in the future, how will I be in the future, having been what, what will I become in the future?' nor will they now in the present be tormented with doubt thinking: 'Am I, am I not, what am I, how am I, where has this being come from, where will it go?' For such a place does not exist. Why is that? For, bhikkhus, a noble disciple sees this dependent co-arising and these phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising as they really are with correct wisdom.\""}]}

Bhikkhus, aspiration that is accompanied by restlessness and associated with restlessness — this is called aspiration that is too intense.\n\nBhikkhus, what is an aspiration that is inwardly inhibited? Bhikkhus, aspiration that is accompanied by dullness and drowsiness and associated with dullness and drowsiness — this is called aspiration that is inwardly inhibited.\n\nBhikkhus, what is an aspiration that is outwardly scattered? Bhikkhus, aspiration that is outwardly scattered due to engagement with the five cords of sensual pleasure — this is called aspiration that is outwardly scattered.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell continuously aware: 'As before, so after; as after, so before'? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's mindfulness of before and after is well grasped, well attended to, well sustained, and well penetrated by wisdom.

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the base of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration, accompanied by an intention of continuous effort by day, and also by night, thus: 'My aspiration will not be too slack, nor too intense, nor inwardly inhibited, nor outwardly scattered.' He dwells contemplating 'As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.' Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating 'As by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.'\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop a mind that is clarified, unconfined and radiant?

Thus developed and frequently practiced, bhikkhus, the four bases of psychic ability are of great fruit and great benefit.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has developed and frequently practiced the four bases of psychic ability experiences various kinds of psychic abilities: being one, he becomes many; being many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he passes through walls, enclosures, and mountains as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though on solid ground; he flies through the air cross-legged like a bird with wings; he touches and strokes the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; and he controls his body as far as the Brahmā world. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has developed and frequently practiced the four bases of psychic ability, through the wearing away of the taints, attains and dwells in the taintless release of mind and release by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge in this very life.\""}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"This is the only way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of suffering and discontentment, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of Nibbāna, namely the four establishments of mindfulness.\n\nWhat are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed (lust, desire, attachment) and dissatisfaction (aversion, ill-will, resentment) for the world; he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed and dissatisfaction for the world; he dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed and dissatisfaction for the world; he dwells contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed and dissatisfaction for the world.\n\nSummary completed.\n\n### 1. Contemplation of the Body\n\n#### 1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing\nHow, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him. Mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.\n\nBreathing in long, he knows, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he knows, 'I breathe out long';\n\nbreathing in short, he knows, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he knows, 'I breathe out short'.\n\nHe trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'.\n\nHe trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation'.\n\nJust as a skilled turner (carpenter) or his apprentice, when making a long turn knows, 'I make a long turn', or making a short turn knows, 'I make a short turn'; so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu knows, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he knows, 'I breathe out long'; breathing in short, he knows, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he knows, 'I breathe out short'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation'.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Mindfulness of Breathing is completed.\n\n#### 1.2. Contemplation of the Body in Postures\nAgain, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu knows, 'I am walking'; when standing, he knows, 'I am standing'; when sitting, he knows, 'I am sitting'; when lying down, he knows, 'I am lying down'; or however his body is disposed, he knows it.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Postures is completed.\n\n#### 1.3. Contemplation of the Body in full awareness\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with full awareness when going forward and returning; who acts with full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts with full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts with full awareness in wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts with full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts with full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts with full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on full awareness is completed.\n\n#### 1.4. Contemplation of the Body in the Asubha Practice (Reflection on repulsiveness)\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the top of the hair down, bounded by skin and full of various impurities: 'In this body, there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, contents of the stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, oil of the joints, and urine.'\n\nJust as if, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain, such as rice, barley, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyesight having opened it were to reflect, 'These are rice, these are barley, these are beans, these are peas, these are millet, these are white rice.'\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the top of the head down, surrounded by skin and filled with various kinds of impurity: 'In this body, there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach contents, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, snot, synovial fluid, urine.'\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Asubha Practice is completed.\n\n#### 1.5. Contemplation of the Body in Reflection on the Elements\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: 'In this body, there are the earth element, water element, fire element, and air element.'\n\nJust as if, bhikkhus, a skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice, having killed a cow, were to sit at a crossroads with it cut up into pieces.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body, as it stands, as it is laid down, according to elements: 'In this body, there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element.'\n\nThus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing phenomena in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing phenomena in the body. 'There is a body,' thus mindfulness is established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Reflection on the Elements is completed.\n\n#### 1.6. Contemplation of the Body in the Cemetery Contemplations\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery one, two, or three days dead, bloated, discolored, and decomposing. He applies this perception to his own body: 'This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.' Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery being eaten by crows, dogs, vultures, or various kinds of creatures. He applies this perception to his own body: 'This very body is of the same nature, it will become like that, it is not beyond that.' Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally...\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews... a skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews... a fleshless skeleton, held together with sinews... bones scattered in all directions, here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a hip bone, there a backbone, here a rib bone, there a breast bone, here an arm bone, there a shoulder bone, here a neck bone, there a jaw bone, here a tooth, there a skull. He applies this perception to his own body: 'This very body is of the same nature, it will become like that, it is not beyond that.' Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally...\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery, the bones whitened, the color of shells... bones heaped up, over a year old... bones decayed into dust. He applies this perception to his own body: 'This very body is of the same nature, it will become like that, it is not beyond that.'\n\nThus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally; contemplating the arising phenomena in the body, or contemplating the vanishing phenomena in the body, or contemplating both the arising and vanishing phenomena in the body. 'There is a body,' thus mindfulness is established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Cemetery Contemplations is completed.\n\nThe Fourteen Contemplations of the Body are completed.\n\n### 2. Contemplation of Feelings\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating feelings in feelings?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, when feeling a pleasant feeling, a bhikkhu knows, 'I feel a pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a painful feeling, he knows, 'I feel a painful feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a worldly pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel a worldly pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling an unworldly (interior) pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel an unworldly pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a worldly painful feeling, he knows, 'I feel a worldly painful feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling an unworldly painful feeling, he knows, 'I feel an unworldly painful feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling an unworldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel an unworldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating feelings internally, or he dwells contemplating feelings externally, or he dwells contemplating feelings both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in feelings, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing phenomena in feelings, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing phenomena in feelings. 'There is a feeling,' thus mindfulness is established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating feelings in feelings.\n\nThe section on Contemplation of Feelings is completed.\n\n### 3.

He dwells contemplating the arising factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in a mental quality. The awareness 'There are mental qualities' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities in the Four Noble Truths.\n\nThe section on the Contemplation of Mental Qualities in the Four Noble Truths is completed.\n\n\"Indeed, bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-returner status.\n\nLet alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six years... five years... four years... three years... two years... one year... Let alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven months, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-returner status. Let alone seven months, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six months... five months... four months... three months... two months... one month... half a month... Let alone half a month, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for one week, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-returner status.\"\n\n\"This is the only way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of suffering and discontentment, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of Nibbāna, namely the four establishments of mindfulness.\" Thus what was said, was said in relation to this.\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

The venerable Sāriputta said this:\n\n\"Friends, there are these five ways a bhikkhu should use to completely remove resentment when it has arisen. What are the five?\n\nHere, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, but whose conduct by speech is pure, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by speech is impure, but whose conduct by body is pure, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is also impure, but who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is also impure, and who does not gain an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is pure, and whose conduct by speech is pure, and who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, but whose conduct by speech is pure, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a bhikkhu who wears rag-robes, seeing a rag on the roadside, would pick it up with his left foot, spread it out with his right foot, and taking what is usable, leave. In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, but whose conduct by speech is pure, one should not focus on their impure bodily conduct at that time, but should focus on their pure conduct by speech. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by speech is impure, but whose conduct by body is pure, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a lotus pond covered with moss. Then a person comes along, scorched and exhausted by the heat, thirsty and parched. He would plunge into the pond, part the moss with both hands, and drink the water with his cupped hands, then leave. In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by speech is impure, but whose conduct by body is pure, one should not focus on their impure conduct by speech at that time, but should focus on their pure conduct by body. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure and whose conduct by speech is impure, but who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, there was a small amount of water in a cow's footprint. Then a person comes along, scorched and exhausted by the heat, thirsty and parched. He might think: 'If I drink this water with my hands or a cup, I will stir it up and make it undrinkable. Let me get down on all fours and drink it like a cow.' So he gets down on all fours, drinks the water, and leaves. In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is impure, but who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, one should not focus on their impure bodily conduct, nor on their impure conduct by speech at that time. Instead, one should focus on the mental clarity they gain from time to time. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure and whose conduct by speech is impure, and who does not gain an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a person who is ill, suffering, and gravely sick is traveling along a road. Ahead of him is a village, and behind him is another village, both far away. He does not obtain suitable food, suitable medicine, a suitable attendant, or a suitable guide. Then another person, traveling along the road, would see him and feel compassion, sympathy, and a sense of care, thinking, 'Oh, may this person obtain suitable food, suitable medicine, a suitable attendant, and a suitable guide. Why? So that this person may not come to ruin and disaster right here.' In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is impure, and who does not gain an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, one should feel compassion, sympathy, and a sense of care for such a person, thinking, 'Oh, may this venerable one abandon impure conduct by body and develop pure conduct by body, abandon impure conduct by speech and develop pure conduct by speech, abandon impure conduct by mind and develop pure conduct by mind. Why? So that this venerable one, with the breaking up of the body after death, may not be reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.'\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is pure and whose conduct by speech is pure, and who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a clear, sweet, cool, and clean pond, well-established, lovely, and covered with various trees. Then a person comes along, scorched and exhausted by the heat, thirsty and parched. He would plunge into the pond, bathe, drink, and after coming out, would sit or lie down in the shade of the trees.\n\nIn the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is pure, and whose conduct by speech is pure, and who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, one should focus on their pure bodily conduct, on their pure conduct by speech, and on the mental clarity they gain from time to time. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed. Friends, when the mind is developed in such an all-around pleasing way towards such a person, it becomes serene.\n\nThese are the five ways, friends, by which a bhikkhu should completely remove resentment when it has arisen."}]}

Sitting at one side, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Is there, venerable sir, one quality developed and frequently practiced that fulfills four qualities, the four qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill seven qualities, the seven qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill two qualities?\"\n\n\"There is, Ānanda, one quality developed and frequently practiced that fulfills four qualities, the four qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill seven qualities, the seven qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill two qualities.\"\n\n\"And what, venerable sir, is the one quality developed and frequently practiced that fulfills four qualities, the four qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill seven qualities, the seven qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill two qualities?\"\n\n\"Ānanda, mindfulness of breathing when developed and frequently practiced fulfills the four establishments of mindfulness, the four establishments of mindfulness when developed and cultivated fulfill the seven factors of awakening, the seven factors of awakening when developed and cultivated, bring clear knowing and release to completion.\n\nHow is mindfulness of breathing developed, Ānanda, how is it frequently practiced to fulfill the four establishments of mindfulness? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him. Mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.\n\n\"When, Ānanda, a bhikkhu, breathing in long, knows 'I breathe in long', and breathing out long, knows 'I breathe out long'; breathing in short, knows 'I breathe in short', and breathing out short, knows 'I breathe out short'; he practices calming the bodily formations while breathing in, practices calming the bodily formations while breathing out — at that time, Ānanda, observing the body in the body, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished greed (desire, attachment) and displeasure (aversion, ill-will, resentment) with regard to the world. For what reason? Because of the in-and-out breaths. Therefore, Ānanda, in the (domain of) body, the bhikkhu at that time dwells observing the body in the body, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\n\"When, Ānanda, a bhikkhu trains in breathing in feeling rapture, and in breathing out feeling rapture; trains in breathing in feeling ease, and in breathing out feeling ease; he trains in to calm mental formations while breathing in, and he trains in to calms mental formations while breathing out — at that time, Ānanda, dwelling in observing the feelings in feelings, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished craving and displeasure with regard to the world. For what reason? Because, Ānanda, I declare among feelings, this is crucial — careful attention to the in-and-out breaths. Therefore, Ānanda, in the (domain of) feelings, a bhikkhu at that time dwells observing feelings in feelings, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\n\"When, Ānanda, a bhikkhu trains 'I will breathe in experiencing the mind', and 'I will breathe out experiencing the mind'; 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind', 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind'; 'I will breathe in concentrating the mind', 'I will breathe out concentrating the mind'; 'I will breathe in freeing the mind', 'I will breathe out freeing the mind' — at that time, Ānanda, observing the mind in the mind, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished craving and displeasure with regard to the world. For what reason? Ānanda, I do not speak of the cultivation of mindfulness of breathing for one forgetful and not fully aware. Therefore, Ānanda, in the (domain of) mind, a bhikkhu at that time dwells observing the mind in the mind, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\n\"When, Ānanda, a bhikkhu observes impermanence while breathing in, and observes impermanence while breathing out; observes dispassion while breathing in, and observes dispassion while breathing out; observes cessation while breathing in, and observes cessation while breathing out; he trains to observe relinquishment while breathing in, and trains to observe relinquishment while breathing out — at that time, Ānanda, observing mental qualities within mental qualities, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished craving and displeasure with regard to the world. For what reason? Because of careful attention to the in-and-out breaths. Therefore, Ānanda, in the (domain of) mental qualities, the bhikkhu at that time dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\nThus Ānanda, mindfulness of breathing when frequently practiced fulfills the four establishments of mindfulness.\n\n\"How, Ānanda, do the four foundations of mindfulness when frequently practiced fulfill the seven factors of awakening? When, Ānanda, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in the body, mindfulness is established in him at that time, unconfused. When, Ānanda, mindfulness is established in the bhikkhu, unconfused (clear), at that time the awakening factor of mindfulness is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, and the awakening factor of mindfulness in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\n\n\"While dwelling thus mindful, he investigates, explores, and fully examines that state. When, Ānanda, the bhikkhu, being thus mindful, investigates, explores, and fully examines that state, at that time the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena (dhamma) is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena, and the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena reaches the culmination of its development in the bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"When a bhikkhu with wisdom investigates, explores, and fully examines that state, persistence is aroused unflaggingly. When, Ānanda, for the bhikkhu, his examination of that state with wisdom leads to persistence, unfaltering, at that time, the awakening factor of energy is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of energy, and the awakening factor of energy reaches the culmination of its development in the bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"When, for a bhikkhu in whom persistence has aroused, an unworldly joy (rapture) arises, at that time, Ānanda, as the bhikkhu experiences unworldly joy from the persistence that has been aroused — the awakening factor of joy is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of joy, and the awakening factor of joy in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\n\n\"With joy in the mind, both the body and the mind relaxes. When, Ānanda, for the bhikkhu filled with joy, the body and the mind relaxes — the awakening factor of tranquility is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of tranquility, and the awakening factor of tranquility in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\n\n\"With the body tranquil (at ease) and the mind content, the mind becomes concentrated. When, Ānanda, for the bhikkhu, with a tranquil body and a content mind, the mind becomes concentrated — the awakening factor of collectedness is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of collectedness, and the awakening factor of collectedness in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\"\n\n\"With the mind well-concentrated, he closely observes. When, Ānanda, the bhikkhu, with his mind well-concentrated, closely observes — at that time, the awakening factor of equanimity (mental poise) is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of equanimity, and the awakening factor of equanimity in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\n\n\"At that time, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu dwells observing feelings in feelings, the mind in the mind, mental qualities in mental qualities — mindfulness is established in him at that time, unconfused. At that time, Ānanda, when mindfulness is established in the bhikkhu, unconfused, at that time the awakening factor of mindfulness is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, and the awakening factor of mindfulness reaches the culmination of its development in the bhikkhu.\"\n\n[Similarly with the other three establishings of mindfulness: in feelings, mind, and mental qualities.]\n\n\"This is how Ānanda, when the four foundations of mindfulness are developed and cultivated, lead to fulfillment of the seven factors of awakening.\"\n\n\"And how are the seven factors of awakening developed and cultivated to lead to clear knowing and complete release? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, maturing in release; the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena is developed ... the awakening factor of energy if developed ... the awakening factor of joy is developed ... the awakening factor of tranquility is developed ... the awakening factor of collectedness is developed ... the awakening factor of equanimity is developed, dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, maturing in release. This is how the seven factors of awakening, when developed and cultivated, lead to complete liberation by wisdom.\""}]}

Just as, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata knows, as it actually is, beings passing away and arising, so too does the Tathāgata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nIf others, bhikkhus, approach the Tathāgata and question him about the wearing away of the taints, as he actually knows and has realized it, with the knowledge that the Tathāgata possesses, the Tathāgata will answer accordingly. Just as, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata knows, as it actually is, the wearing away of the taints, so too does the Tathāgata answer accordingly when asked.\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, I declare that knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of the results of actions in the past, future, and present, according to their causes and conditions, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of the defilement, purification, and emergence of jhānas, liberations, and samādhi attainments, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of manifold past lives, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of beings passing away and arising, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness. Knowledge of the wearing away of the taints, as it actually is, is accessible to one who has collectedness, not to one who lacks collectedness.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, collectedness is the path; non-collectedness is the wrong path.\""}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" responded the bhikkhus to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then spoke:\n\n\"Once, bhikkhus, I was dwelling near Uruvelā, on the bank of the Nerañjarā River, at the foot of the Ajapāla banyan tree. There, having just attained enlightenment and being in solitude, a reflection arose in my mind: 'Indeed, living without respect and guidance results in suffering. What if I were to honor and rely upon an ascetic or a brahmin?'\n\nIt then occurred to me, bhikkhus: 'I should only rely on another ascetic or brahmin to complete what is lacking in my aggregate of virtue. However, I see no one in the world with its devas, Māras, and Brahmas, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners, who possesses virtue superior to my own, to whom I could look up for respect and guidance.\n\nIn the same way, I should only depend on another ascetic or brahmin to fulfill what is lacking in my collectedness aggregate. But, I see no one in the world who surpasses my own collectedness.\n\nLikewise, to complete what is lacking in my wisdom aggregate, I would depend on another ascetic or brahmin. However, I see no one in the world who surpasses my own wisdom.\n\nFurthermore, to complete what is lacking in my liberation aggregate, I would depend on another ascetic or brahmin. Yet, I see no one in the world who possesses liberation greater than mine.\n\nThus, I considered: 'Why not honor and depend on this Dhamma that I have fully realized?'\n\nThen, bhikkhus, Brahmā Sahampati, perceiving the deliberations of my mind, as easily as a strong man might stretch out or withdraw his arm, appeared before me from the Brahma-world. Brahmā Sahampati, draping his outer robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, placed his hands together towards me, and said: 'So it is, Blessed One, so it is, Well-Gone One. Just as the past Fully Enlightened Ones honored and depended on the Dhamma, and as future Fully Enlightened Ones will do, so too should you, currently the Blessed One, the Fully Enlightened One, honor and depend on the Dhamma.'\n\nAfter speaking, Brahmā Sahampati continued:\n\n'The Buddhas of the past,\nAnd those yet to arise,\nAs well as the present Buddha,\nAll dispellers of sorrow.\n\nAll have revered the true Dhamma,\nThey lived, they live,\nand they will live [in future] thus;\nThis is the nature of the Buddhas.\n\nTherefore, those who desire their own benefit (self-liberation),\nAspiring for excellence;\nShould revere the Dhamma,\nFollowing the Buddha's teachings.'\n\nHaving spoken these words, bhikkhus, Brahmā Sahampati paid homage to me, circumambulated me with his right side towards me, and then disappeared. Thereafter, recognizing Brahmā's request and what was appropriate for myself, I honored and relied upon the Dhamma that I had fully comprehended and lived accordingly. And as the Sangha was also endowed with excellence, respect grew within the Sangha.\""}]}

At that time, Visākhā's (Migāra's mother) pleasing and beloved granddaughter had passed away. Then, Visākhā, with wet clothes and hair, approached the Blessed One during the day; having approached, she paid respects to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. While she was sitting to one side, the Blessed One addressed her:\n\n\"Visākhā, where have you come from, arriving here during the day with wet clothes and hair?\" \n\n\"My granddaughter, who was dear and pleasing to me, has passed away, venerable sir. That is why I have come here during the day with wet clothes and hair.\"\n\n\"Would you, Visākhā, wish to have as many sons and grandsons as there are people in Sāvatthi?\"\n\n\"I would, Blessed One, wish to have as many sons and grandsons as there are people in Sāvatthi.\"\n\n\"How many people die daily in Sāvatthi, Visākhā?\"\n\n\"Ten even, venerable sir, people in Sāvatthi die daily; nine even, venerable sir; eight even, venerable sir; seven even, venerable sir; six even, venerable sir; five even, venerable sir; four even, venerable sir; three even, venerable sir; two even, venerable sir; one even, venerable sir. Sāvatthi is never free from people dying, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Visākhā, would you ever be without wet clothes and hair?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir. It is enough for me to have just a few sons and grandsons.\"\n\n\"Visākhā, for those who have a hundred dear ones, they have a hundred sufferings; for those who have ninety dear ones, they have ninety sufferings; for those who have eighty dear ones, they have eighty sufferings; for those who have seventy dear ones, they have seventy sufferings; for those who have sixty dear ones, they have sixty sufferings; for those who have fifty dear ones, they have fifty sufferings; for those who have forty dear ones, they have forty sufferings; for those who have thirty dear ones, they have thirty sufferings; for those who have twenty dear ones, they have twenty sufferings; for those who have ten dear ones, they have ten sufferings; for those who have nine dear ones, they have nine sufferings; for those who have eight dear ones, they have eight sufferings; for those who have seven dear ones, they have seven sufferings; for those who have six dear ones, they have six sufferings; for those who have five dear ones, they have five sufferings; for those who have four dear ones, they have four sufferings; for those who have three dear ones, they have three sufferings; for those who have two dear ones, they have two sufferings; for those who have one dear one, they have one suffering; for those who have no dear one, they have no suffering. They are sorrow-free, untainted, and unafflicted, I say.\"\n\nThen, knowing the significance of that moment, the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:\n\n\"Whatever sorrows and lamentations there are,\nvarious kinds of suffering in the world;\nthese arise because of what is dear,\nwithout what is dear, they do not occur.\n\nTherefore, those who are free from attachment,\nwho have no dear ones anywhere in the world;\naspiring to be sorrow-free and untainted,\nshould not hold anything dear in the world.\""}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:\n\n\"Just as, bhikkhus, this river Ganges might carry along a large lump of foam, a person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a lump of foam, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever form there is, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees it, reflects on it, and thoroughly examines it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it appears to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in form, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, during the autumn season when the sky is thick with clouds and it rains, bubbles form on the surface of the water. A person with good sight would see them, reflect on them, and thoroughly examine them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a water bubble, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever feelings there are, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees them, reflects on them, and thoroughly examines them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in feelings, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, during the last month of the hot season, at midday, a mirage shimmers. A person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a mirage, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever perceptions there are, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees them, reflects on them, and thoroughly examines them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in perceptions, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a man seeking heartwood, searching for the essence of heartwood, and on a quest for heartwood, taking a sharp axe, would enter the forest. There he would see a large banana tree, straight, young, and without a defect. He would cut it at the root; having cut it at the root, he would cut off the top; having cut off the top, he would peel away the outer sheaths. Peeling away the outer sheaths, he would not find even softwood, much less heartwood. A person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in the trunk of a banana tree, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever volitional formations there are, whether in the past, the future, and the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees them, reflects on them, and thoroughly examines them. Upon seeing them, reflecting on them, and thoroughly examining them, they appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in volitional formations, bhikkhus?\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a magician or a magician's apprentice might display a magic trick at a crossroads. A person with good sight would see it, reflect on it, and thoroughly examine it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it would appear to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in a magic trick, bhikkhus?\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, whatever consciousness there is, whether in the past, the future, and in the present... whether far or near, a bhikkhu sees it, reflects on it, and thoroughly examines it. Upon seeing it, reflecting on it, and thoroughly examining it, it appears to him as empty, hollow, and without essence. For what essence could there be in consciousness, bhikkhus?\n\nSeeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with form, grows disenchanted with feelings, grows disenchanted with perceptions, grows disenchanted with volitional formations, grows disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there is insight that he is liberated. He understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nThus spoke the Blessed One. Having said this, the Well-Gone one, the teacher, further said:\n\n\"Form is like a lump of foam,\nFeeling is like a water bubble;\nPerception is like a mirage,\nVolitional formations are like a banana tree;\nAnd consciousness is like a magic trick,\nSo taught the Kinsman of the Sun (an epithet of the Buddha).\n\nAs one reflects on them,\nThoroughly examines them;\nThey appear as empty, hollow, and without essence,\nTo one who sees them thus.\n\nThis body too, when comprehended\nBy the one with great wisdom;\nIs seen as having abandoned the three things (life, heat, and consciousness),\nForm as discarded.\n\nWhen life, heat, and consciousness\nDepart from this body;\nIt lies there thrown away,\nLike an inanimate thing discarded by others.\n\nSuch is the continuity of this illusion,\nA babble of children in a magic show;\nIt is described as a murderer,\nWith no essence to be found therein.\n\nThus should a bhikkhu contemplate the aggregates,\nWith energy aroused;\nBy day or by night,\nEver mindful and aware.\n\nOne should abandon all attachments,\nAnd make oneself one's own refuge;\nLiving as if one's head was on fire,\nAiming for the imperishable goal.\""}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus\".\n\n\"Venerable sir\", those bhikkhus responded to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: \n\n\"Before my enlightenment, when I was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta (a being seeking enlightenment), it occurred to me, 'What if I divided my thoughts into two kinds?' Thus, bhikkhus, I made one part consist of the thoughts of sensuality (acquisition), ill-will (resentment, hostility, hate), and harm (an active intent of causing physical or psychological harm); and the other part consist of the thoughts of relinquishment (letting go, giving up), non-ill-will (good-will, loving-kindness), and non-harm (compassion).\n\n### Unwholesome Thoughts\n\n#### Sensuality\n\nWhile ardently and resolutely dwelling, a thought of sensuality arose in me, bhikkhus. I then understood: 'This thought of sensuality has arisen. It leads to harm for myself, to the harm of others, and to the harm of both. It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibbāna.' Reflecting in this way, bhikkhus, that 'It leads to my harm,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of others,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of both,' it subsided in me; 'It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibbāna,' it also subsided in me. Therefore, bhikkhus, whenever a thought of sensuality arose, I immediately abandoned it, removed it, and completely eradicated it.\n\n#### Ill-will And Harm\n\nAs I was ardently and resolutely dwelling, bhikkhus, a thought of ill-will and a thought of harm arose in me. I then understood: 'This thought of harm has arisen in me. It leads to my harm, to the harm of others, and to the harm of both. It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibbāna.' Reflecting thus, bhikkhus, that 'It leads to my harm,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of others,' it subsided in me; 'It leads to the harm of both,' it subsided in me; 'It obstructs wisdom, inclines towards affliction, and leads away from Nibbāna,' also it subsided in me. Therefore, bhikkhus, whenever a thought of harm arose, I immediately abandoned it, removed it, and completely eradicated it.\n\nWhatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks about and ponders upon, bhikkhus, that will become the inclination of his mind. If a bhikkhu frequently thinks about and ponders upon thoughts of sensuality, he abandons thoughts of relinquishment, makes thoughts of sensuality predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of sensuality. Similarly, if he frequently engages with thoughts of ill-will and harming, he abandons thoughts of non-harming, makes thoughts of harming predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of harming.\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, in the last month of the rainy season, during the autumn when the fields are muddy, a cowherd guards his cows by prodding them here and there with a stick, blocking their path, restraining them, and preventing them from straying. Why does he do this? Because he sees that straying could lead to punishment, capture, confiscation, or blame.\n\nSimilarly, bhikkhus, I perceived the danger, inferiority and defilement in unwholesome states, and the benefit and the purification in wholesome states of relinquishment.\n\n### Wholesome Thoughts\n\n#### Relinquishment\n\nWhile ardently and resolutely dwelling, a thought of relinquishment arose in me, bhikkhus. I then understood: 'This thought of relinquishment has arisen in me. It leads neither to harm for myself, nor for others, nor for both. It cultivates wisdom, is free from affliction, and leads towards Nibbāna.' Reflecting in this way, bhikkhus, whether I contemplated it by night or pondered it by day, I perceived no fear arising from it. Nevertheless, should I think and ponder too long, my body would fatigue. When the body is fatigued, the mind gets disturbed; a disturbed mind is far from being concentrated. Therefore, bhikkhus, I stabilized my mind internally, settled it, unified it, and concentrated it. Why? So that my mind might not become disturbed.\n\n#### Non-Ill-Will And Non-Harm\n\nWhile ardently and resolutely dwelling, bhikkhus, thoughts of non-ill-will and non-harming arose in me. I then understood: 'This thought of non-harming has arisen in me. It leads neither to harm for myself, nor for others, nor for both. It cultivates wisdom, is free from affliction, and leads towards Nibbāna.' Reflecting in this way, bhikkhus, whether I contemplated it by night or pondered it by day, I perceived no fear arising from it. However, should I think and ponder too long, my body would become fatigued. When the body is fatigued, the mind becomes disturbed; a disturbed mind is far from being concentrated. Therefore, bhikkhus, I stabilized my mind internally, settled it, unified it, and concentrated it. Why? So that my mind might not become disturbed.\n\nWhatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks about and ponders upon, bhikkhus, that will become the inclination of his mind. If a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of relinquishment, he abandons thoughts of sensuality, makes thoughts of relinquishment predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of relinquishment. Similarly, if a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of non-ill-will and non-harming, he abandons thoughts of harm, makes thoughts of non-harming predominant, and his mind inclines towards those thoughts of non-harming.\n\nJust as in the last month of the hot season, when all the crops have been brought inside the villages, a cowherd would guard his cows while stationed at the root of a tree or in the open, since he needs only to be mindful that the cows are there; so too, there was need for me only to be mindful that those states were there.\n\n### The Four Jhānas\n\nBhikkhus, unrelenting energy was aroused (in me), clear and unforgetful mindfulness was established, the body was tranquil and unexcited, and the mind was collected and unified.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, having secluded myself from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental states, with reflection and examination (of thoughts), born of seclusion, filled with joyful pleasure, I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna.\n\nWith the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, devoid of reflection and examination, born of collectedness and filled with joyful pleasure, I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna.\n\nWith the fading away of joyful pleasure, I dwelled equanimous and mindful, fully aware, and experienced physical pleasure, which the noble ones describe as 'one who dwells happily, equanimous and mindful.' Thus, I entered and dwelled in the third jhāna.\n\nWith the abandonment of ease (bliss) and suffering (discontentment, stress), and with the previous disappearance of joy and sorrow, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensation, and with the purity of equanimity and mindfulness, I entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna.\n\n### The Three True Knowledges\n\nThus, with my mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, I directed my mind towards the knowledge of recalling past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, including details and brief descriptions of each life.\n\nIn the first watch of the night, bhikkhus, I attained the first knowledge: ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, and light arose, as occurs for one who is diligent, ardent, and resolute in practice.\n\nThus, with my mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, I directed my mind toward the knowledge of the death and rebirth of beings. With the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing, endowed with bodily misconduct and other misdeeds, in various states, fair and foul, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood them according to their actions.\n\nIn the middle watch of the night, I attained the second knowledge: once more, ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, and light arose, reflecting the state of one who is diligent, ardent, and resolute in practice.\n\nThus, with my mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, I directed my mind towards the knowledge of eradicating the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'\n\n'I know these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is, 'This is the origin of these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is, 'This is the cessation of these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is, 'This is the way leading to the cessation of these taints,' I directly knew as it actually is. Knowing and seeing thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of ignorance. In me, liberated, there arose the knowledge of liberation: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nThis, bhikkhus, was the third knowledge attained by me in the last watch of the night; ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, and light arose, as happens in one who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute.\n\nSuppose, bhikkhus, in a wooded range there is a great low-lying marsh near which a large herd of deer resides. A man appears, desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage, and closes off the safe and good path to be joyfully traveled, opens a false path, and sets out a decoy and a dummy, leading the herd towards calamity, disaster, and loss. Yet another man appears, desiring their good, welfare, and protection. He reopens the safe and good path leading to their happiness, closes off the false path, removes the decoy, and destroys the dummy, enabling the herd to achieve growth, increase, and fulfillment.\n\nBhikkhus, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning. This is the meaning: 'The great low-lying marsh' is a term for sensual pleasures. 'The large herd of deer' represents beings. 'The man desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage' is a term for Māra the Evil One. 'The false path' represents the wrong eightfold path - wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong collectedness (concentration). 'The decoy' is a term for delight and lust. 'The dummy' is a term for ignorance (misapprehension of true reality/how things have come to be). 'The man desiring their good, welfare, and protection' is a term for the Tathāgata, the accomplished and fully enlightened one. 'The safe and good path to be traveled joyfully' is a term for the Noble Eightfold Path - right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness (concentration).\n\nSo, bhikkhus, the safe and good path to be traveled joyfully has been reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy removed, the dummy destroyed.\n\nWhat a teacher should do out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, I have done for you, bhikkhus. Here are these roots of trees, here are these empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be negligent; lest you later regret it. This is our instruction to you.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

Then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approached the Venerable Ānanda. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Venerable Ānanda. After exchanging friendly and courteous greetings, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the brahmin Uṇṇābha said to the Venerable Ānanda: \"Master Ānanda, for what purpose is the spiritual life lived under the ascetic Gotama?\"\n\n\"Brahmin, it is for the purpose of abandoning desire that the spiritual life is lived under the Blessed One.\"\n\n\"But, Master Ānanda, is there a path, is there a way to abandon this desire?\"\n\n\"Yes, brahmin, there is a path, there is a way to abandon this desire.\"\n\n\"What, then, is the path, what is the way to abandon this desire?\"\n\n\"Here, brahmin, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from desire (an aspiration, a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort; and develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort. This, brahmin, is the path, this is the way to abandon this desire.\"\n\n\"In that case, Master Ānanda, it would be impossible to abandon desire by means of desire itself.\"\n\n\"Then, brahmin, I will ask you a question. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin: Did you earlier have the desire, 'I will go to the park,' and now that you have come to the park, has that desire you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you earlier arouse energy, thinking, 'I will go to the park,' and now that you have come to the park, has that energy you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you earlier resolve in your mind, 'I will go to the park,' and now that you have come to the park, has that resolution in the mind you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Ānanda.\"\n\n\"Did you earlier make an investigation, 'Shall I go to the park?' and now that you have come to the park, has that investigation you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In the same way, brahmin, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints have been exhausted, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, utterly exhausted the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through final knowledge, the desire that he had before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. The energy that he had aroused before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. The resolution in the mind that he had before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. The investigation that he had made before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. What do you think, brahmin, such being the case, does the [path] have an end or is it endless?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Master Ānanda, in such a case, the [path] has an end, it is not endless. Excellent, Master Ānanda, excellent. It is as if one were to set upright what had been overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to hold a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms. So, too, Master Ānanda has, in many ways, made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. Let Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day onward, for life.\""}]}

Then Moggallāna the Accountant, a Brahmin, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After a cordial and meaningful conversation, he sat to one side. Seated to one side, the Accountant Moggallāna said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Just as, dear Gotama, in this Mansion of Migāra's Mother, one can see a gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progression — up to the final step on the staircase; just as among us Brahmins, there is a visible gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in our studies; just as among the archers, there is a visible gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in archery; so too, dear Gotama, for us accountants, whose livelihood is in accountancy, there is a visible gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in accountancy. When we receive a new pupil, we first make him calculate 'one ones, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens' and up to a hundred. Now, dear Gotama, is it possible to describe a similar gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in your Dhamma and discipline?\"\n\n### Virtuous Conduct\n\n\"Indeed, Brahmin, it is possible to set forth a gradual training, practice, and practice in this Dhamma and discipline as well. Just as, Brahmin, a skilled horse trainer acquires a fine thoroughbred and initially trains it in the management of the bit, then proceeds to further training; similarly, dear Brahmin, the Tathāgata initially trains a person thus: 'Come, bhikkhu, be virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the Pātimokkha (Bhikkhu's rules), endowed with conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and undertake and train in the precepts.'\n\n### Sense Restraint\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the Pātimokkha, endowed with conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and undertakes the training in the precepts, then the Tathāgata further trains him: 'Come, bhikkhu, guard the doors of your sense faculties. Upon seeing a form with the eye, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the eye faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness (craving/desire/attachment with strong yearning and eagerness) and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the eye faculty, achieve mastery over it. In the same way, when hearing a sound with the ear, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the ear faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the ear faculty, achieve mastery over it. Similarly, when smelling an odor with the nose, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the nose faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the nose faculty, achieve mastery over it. Likewise, when tasting a flavor with the tongue, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the tongue faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the tongue faculty, achieve mastery over it. In the same manner, when feeling a tactile sensation with the body, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the body faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the body faculty, achieve mastery over it. Finally, when cognizing a mental object with the mind, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the mind faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the mind faculty, achieve mastery over it.'\n\n### Moderation in Eating\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu guards the doors of his sense faculties well, the Tathāgata further trains him: 'Come, bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Consider wisely the food you consume — not for amusement, nor for indulgence, nor for physical appearance, nor for beautification, but only for the sustenance and maintenance of this body, for keeping it healthy, for aiding the spiritual life, thinking thus: 'I will allay old feelings of hunger without arousing new feelings, and so that I may be healthy and blameless and live in comfort.'\"\n\n### Dedication to Wakefulness\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is moderate in eating, the Tathāgata further trains him: 'Come, bhikkhu, remain devoted to wakefulness. During the day, purify your mind from obstructive states through walking meditation and sitting meditation. During the first watch of the night, purify your mind in the same way; in the middle watch of the night, lie down on the right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your mind the idea of rising; in the last watch of the night, rise up and continue purifying your mind from obstructive states through walking meditation and sitting meditation.'\"\n\n### Mindfulness and Full Awareness\n\n\"When, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is devoted to wakefulness, the Tathāgata further instructs him: 'Come, bhikkhu, be endowed with mindfulness and full awareness. Be fully aware when going forward and returning; be fully aware when looking ahead and looking away; be fully aware when bending and stretching; be fully aware when carrying the outer robe, the bowl and wearing robes; be fully aware when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; be fully aware when defecating and urinating; be fully aware when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent.'\n\n### Seclusion\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is endowed with mindfulness and full awareness, the Tathāgata further instructs him: 'Come, bhikkhu, dwell in a secluded lodging — in the forest, at the root of a tree, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in a jungle thicket, in an open space, or on a heap of straw.' Thus, he dwells in a secluded lodging — in the forest, at the root of a tree, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in a jungle thicket, in an open space, or on a heap of straw.\n\n#### Abandoning the Five Hindrances\n\nAfter his meal, having returned from the alms-round, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. He abandons covetousness for the world and lives with a mind rid of covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. He abandons ill-will and hatred, lives with a benevolent mind towards all beings, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill-will and hatred. He abandons dullness (complacency) and agitation, and lives alert and with full awareness; he purifies his mind from dullness (complacency) and agitation. He abandons restlessness (mental agitation) and remorse, lives tranquil and internally serene; he purifies his mind from restlessness (mental agitation) and remorse. He abandons doubt, lives having crossed over doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.\n\n#### Dwell in Jhānas\n\nHaving abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which includes applied thought and sustained thought (reflection and examination), with rapture (intense joy) and pleasure born of seclusion. With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without reflection or examination, with rapture and pleasure born of collectedness. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells equanimous, mindful and fully aware; and he experiences in his own person that bliss of which the noble ones say: 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' Thus, he enters and dwells in the third jhāna. With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and displeasure, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.\n\nThose bhikkhus, Brahmin, who are trainees, aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage, abide thus. But those bhikkhus who are arahants, who have exhausted the taints, who have lived the spiritual life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained their true goal, utterly exhausted the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, for them these teachings lead to dwelling in ease here and to mindfulness and full awareness.\"\n\n### Who Attains Nibbāna\n\nThus having spoken, the Brahmin Accountant Moggallāna asked the Blessed One: \"dear Gotama, do all your disciples who are instructed and guided by you in this way attain final Nibbāna without exception, or do some not attain it?\"\n\n\"Some of my disciples, Brahmin, being instructed and guided by me in this manner, attain final Nibbāna, the ultimate goal, while others do not.\"\n\n\"What is the cause, dear Gotama, and what is the reason that while Nibbāna exists, the path leading to Nibbāna exists, and you, Gotama, are present to encourage, yet when instructed and guided by you, some of your disciples attain final Nibbāna, the ultimate goal, while others do not?\"\n\n\"Then, Brahmin, let me ask you a question in return. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, Brahmin, are you skilled in the path to Rajagaha?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gotama, I am skilled in the path to Rajagaha.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Brahmin, if a man came to you wishing to go to Rajagaha, and said, 'Sir, I wish to go to Rajagaha; show me the way there.' You would tell him, 'This is the way, go in this direction, and after a while, you will see such and such a village, continue and you will see such and such a town, proceed further and you will find yourself in delightful parks, forests, and lands around Rajagaha.' If, after being instructed by you, this person were to take a wrong turn and go backwards, whereas another person, following your instructions, reaches Rajagaha safely, what is the cause, Brahmin, what is the reason why, despite the path to Rajagaha and your instructions, one person goes astray and another reaches Rajagaha?\"\n\n\"What can I do, Gotama, in that situation? I am only the one who shows the way.\"\n\n\"Similarly, Brahmin, Nibbāna exists, the path leading to Nibbāna exists, and I am here to instruct; yet my disciples, being instructed and guided by me, some attain final Nibbāna and some do not. What can I do, Brahmin? I am only the one who shows the way.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Brahmin Accountant Moggallāna said to the Blessed One: \"There are those, dear Gotama, who lack faith, who have left the household life for a livelihood, not out of faith. They are deceitful, insincere, boastful, impudent, unstable, garrulous, unrestrained in their senses, indulgent in food, and not devoted to wakefulness. They do not respect training, are careless, trivial, and lead the spiritual life with a motive of gaining position. They are lazy, lacking energy, forgetful, lacking mindfulness, uncollected, with their minds scattered, and lacking wisdom. These, dear Gotama, do not live in close association with you.\n\nBut those clansmen who have left the household life out of faith, who are not deceitful, insincere, or boastful, who are not impudent, unstable, or garrulous, who guard their senses, are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, regard training highly, and strive earnestly in the spiritual life — these, dear Gotama, do live in close association with you.\n\nJust as among roots, black pepper is reckoned as the best, among scents the red sandalwood, and among flowers the jasmine; similarly, your advice is supreme among the highest truths.\n\nWonderful, dear Gotama, wonderful, dear Gotama! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, reveal what was hidden, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in various ways you have made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha. From today, let the Blessed Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.\""}]}

Then the venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid respects, and sat down to one side. Sitting there, the venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin more superior in direct knowledge than the Blessed One in full awakening.\"\n\n\"Truly remarkable, Sāriputta! You have spoken exalted speech, declared an absolute truth, and roared a lion's roar: 'Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin who is superior in direct knowledge than the Blessed One in full awakening.'\n\nWhat about those who were fully enlightened ones in past times, Sāriputta? Did you know all those blessed ones by encompassing their minds with your mind: 'Such was their virtue, such was their teaching, such was their wisdom, such was their conduct, such was their liberation'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What about those who will be fully enlightened ones in future times, Sāriputta? Will you know all those blessed ones by encompassing their minds with your mind: 'Such will be their virtue, such will be their teaching, such will be their wisdom, such will be their conduct, such will be their liberation'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What about me, Sāriputta, now, the fully enlightened one? Am I known to you by having encompassed my mind with your mind: 'Such is my virtue, such is my teaching, such is my wisdom, such is my conduct, such is my liberation'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And in this case, Sāriputta, regarding the past, future, and present fully enlightened ones, you have no mental knowledge. Then what about the exalted speech that has been spoken, the absolute truth that has been taken, the lion's roar that has been uttered: 'Venerable sir, I have such confidence in the Blessed One. There was not, there will not be, nor is there now another ascetic or brahmin superior in direct knowledge to the Blessed One in full awakening'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir, I have no mental knowledge regarding the past, future, and present fully enlightened ones, but I have discerned the principle through the Dhamma. Just as, venerable sir, in a border city of the king, well fortified with strong walls and gates, with one gate, there the gatekeeper is wise, competent, and intelligent. He prevents strangers and admits acquaintances. Walking around the city, he does not see any gap or opening in the wall, not even a hole for a cat to get through. He thinks: 'Whatever large creatures enter or exit this city, all of them do so through this gate.'\"\n\n\"Just so, venerable sir, it is known to me by the principle: 'Those who were fully enlightened ones in the past, all those blessed ones, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. Those who will be fully enlightened ones in the future, all those blessed ones, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, will fully awaken to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. The Blessed One also, now, the fully enlightened one, having abandoned the five hindrances, mental impurities that weaken wisdom, with mind well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, having developed the seven factors of awakening as they truly are, has fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.'\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent, Sāriputta. Therefore, you should frequently speak this teaching to the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen. For, Sāriputta, if there are any misguided persons who have doubts or uncertainties about the Tathāgata, upon hearing this discourse, their doubts and uncertainties about the Tathāgata will be dispelled.\""}]}

Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus. For in many ways the Blessed One has stated how obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who practices while engaging in them. The Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by the Blessed One to be like a skeleton ... like a piece of meat ... like a grass torch ... like a pit of burning coals ... like a dream ... like borrowed goods ... like the fruits on a tree ... like the butcher's knife and chopping block ... like swords and spears ... like a snake's head, with much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more.\"\n\nEven so, Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, being cross-questioned, asked for reasons, and advised by those bhikkhus, still stubbornly, holding firmly, and doubling down on that harmful view and said: \"Yes, indeed, friends, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.\"\n\nSince those bhikkhus could not separate Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, from this harmful view, they went to the Blessed One. After approaching, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, a certain bhikkhu named Ariṭṭha, who was formerly a vulture catcher, has had such a harmful view arise: 'I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.' We heard it like this, venerable sir.\n\nThen, venerable sir, we went to Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher; after approaching, we said to Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher: Friend Ariṭṭha, is it true that you have had such a harmful view arise: 'I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them?'\n\nWhen this was said, venerable sir, Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, responded to us: 'Yes, indeed, friends, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.'

Since we could not separate Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, from this harmful view, we reported this matter to the Blessed One.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: \"Come, bhikkhu, in my name, call Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher: 'The Teacher calls you, friend Ariṭṭha.'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" that bhikkhu replied to the Blessed One. After approaching Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, said to him: \"The Teacher calls you, friend Ariṭṭha.\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, replied to that bhikkhu. After approaching the Blessed One, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One spoke to Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher:\n\n\"Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have had such a harmful view arise: 'I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them?'\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, venerable sir, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: That those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.\"\n\n\"Misguided person, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way? Haven't I declared in many ways that obstructive things are obstructive? And yet, you claim that they are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them. Sensual pleasures are declared by me to provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by me to be like a skeleton ... like a piece of meat ... like a grass torch ... like a pit of burning coals ... like a dream ... like borrowed goods ... like the fruits on a tree ... like a butcher's knife and chopping block ... like swords and spears ... like a snake's head, with much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Yet, you, misguided person, with your wrong grasp, misrepresent me, harm yourself, and produce much demerit (unwholesome kamma). This will be for your long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"What do you think, bhikkhus, is this Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, even enthusiastic about this Dhamma and Vinaya?\"\n\n\"How could it be, venerable sir; no, venerable sir.\" When this was said, Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, sat silent, dejected, with shoulders drooping, head down, reflecting, unable to respond.\n\nThen the Blessed One, knowing that Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, was silent, dejected, with shoulders drooping, head down, reflecting, and unable to respond, said to him: \"You will be recognized, misguided person, by this own harmful view of yours. Here, I will question the bhikkhus.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Do you also, bhikkhus, understand the Dhamma taught by me in such a way that this Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, with his own wrong grasp, misrepresents me, harms himself, and produces much demerit?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir. Indeed, in many ways, obstructive things have been declared by the Blessed One to be obstructive; and they are capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them. Sensual pleasures are declared by the Blessed One to provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by the Blessed One to be like a skeleton ... like a snake's head, with much suffering, much despair, and the danger in them is still more.\"\n\n\"Good, good, bhikkhus, it is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way. Indeed, bhikkhus, in many ways, I have declared obstructive things to be obstructive, and they are capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.\n\nSensual pleasures are declared by me to provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by me to be like a skeleton ... like a snake's head, with much suffering, much despair, and the danger in them is still more. Yet, this Ariṭṭha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, with his own wrong grasp, misrepresents me, harms himself, and produces much demerit. This will be for his long-term harm and suffering. Bhikkhus, that one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual desires, without perceptions of sensual desire, without thoughts of sensual desire—that is impossible\n\n#### Simile of a Water Snake\n\nHere, bhikkhus, some misguided persons thoroughly learn the Dhamma — discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts. Having thoroughly learned the Dhamma, they do not investigate the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Not investigating the meaning with wisdom, they do not gain a reflective acceptance of them. They learn the Dhamma only for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. They do not experience the purpose for which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, wrongly grasped, lead to their long-term harm and suffering. What is the reason for this? It is because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a man desiring a water snake, seeking a water snake, searching for a water snake, would see a large water snake. He would grasp it either by its coils or its tail. Then that water snake would turn back and bite his hand, his arm, or some other part of his body. Because of that, he would either die or experience death-like suffering. What is the reason for that? It is because of the wrong grasp of the water snake, bhikkhus.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, some misguided persons thoroughly learn the Dhamma — discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts.

Those teachings, wrongly grasped, lead to their long-term harm and suffering. What is the reason for this? It is because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.\n\nHowever, bhikkhus, some noble sons thoroughly learn the Dhamma — discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts. Having thoroughly learned the Dhamma, they investigate the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Investigating the meaning with wisdom, they gain a reflective acceptance of them. They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. They experience the purpose for which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, rightly grasped, lead to their long-term welfare and happiness. What is the reason for that? It is because of their right grasp of the teachings, bhikkhus.\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a man desiring a water snake, seeking a water snake, searching for a water snake, would see a large water snake. He would skillfully grasp it with a cleft stick. Having skillfully grasped it with a cleft stick, he would hold it firmly by the neck. Although that water snake might coil around his hand, his arm, or some other part of his body, he would not die or experience death-like suffering because of that. What is the reason for that? It is because of the right grasp of the water snake, bhikkhus.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, some noble sons thoroughly learn the Dhamma — discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts. Having thoroughly learned the Dhamma, they investigate the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Investigating the meaning with wisdom, they gain a reflective acceptance of them. They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. They experience the purpose for which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, rightly grasped, lead to their long-term welfare and happiness. What is the reason for that? It is because of their right grasp of the teachings, bhikkhus.\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, if you understand the meaning of what I have spoken, you should retain it accordingly. And if you do not understand the meaning of what I have spoken, you should ask me about it, or those other experienced bhikkhus.\n\n#### Simile of a Raft\n\nI will teach you, bhikkhus, the Dhamma by means of a simile of a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. Listen to it and pay close attention, I will speak.\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Just as, bhikkhus, a man traveling on a long journey would see a great expanse of water, with a near shore that is dangerous and fearful, and a far shore that is safe and free from fear; but there would be no boat or bridge for him to cross to the far shore. It would occur to him: 'This is indeed a great expanse of water, with a near shore that is dangerous and fearful, and a far shore that is safe and free from fear; but there is no boat or bridge to cross to the far shore. What if I were to gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves, tie them together into a raft, and relying on that raft, with hands and feet, strive to safely cross to the far shore?' Then, bhikkhus, that man, having gathered grass, sticks, branches, and leaves, tied them together into a raft, and relying on that raft, with hands and feet, striving, would safely cross to the far shore. For that man, having crossed over and reached the far shore, it would occur to him: 'This raft has been very beneficial to me; relying on this raft, with hands and feet, striving, I have safely crossed to the far shore. What if I were to carry this raft on my head or on my shoulder and go wherever I wish?'\n\nWhat do you think, bhikkhus, would that man be acting properly by doing so with that raft?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And how, bhikkhus, would that man be acting properly with that raft? Here, bhikkhus, for that man, having crossed over and reached the far shore, it would occur to him: 'This raft has been very beneficial to me; relying on this raft, with hands and feet, striving, I have safely crossed to the far shore. What if I were to set this raft on the land or sink it in the water and then go wherever I wish?' By acting thus, bhikkhus, that man would be acting properly with that raft.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, the Dhamma has been taught by me with the simile of a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. When you understand the Dhamma taught by me as similar to a raft, even the teachings should be let go, how much more so that which is contrary to the teachings.\n\n#### Standpoint for Views\n\nThere are these six views, bhikkhus. What are the six? Here, bhikkhus, an uninstructed ordinary person, who has not seen the noble ones, is unskilled in the Dhamma of the noble ones, untrained in the Dhamma of the noble ones, who has not seen the virtuous persons, is unskilled in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, untrained in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, perceives form as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; perceives feeling as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; perceives perception as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; perceives formations as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; and whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought, and pondered by the mind, he perceives it as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; and he perceives the view: 'This world is the self, after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity,' he perceives it as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.'\n\nBut the learned disciple of the noble ones, bhikkhus, who has seen the noble ones, is skilled in the Dhamma of the noble ones, trained in the Dhamma of the noble ones, who has seen the virtuous persons, is skilled in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, trained in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, perceives form as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; perceives feeling as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; perceives perception as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; perceives formations as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; and whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought, and pondered by the mind, he perceives it as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; and he perceives the view: 'This world is the self, after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity,' he perceives it as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'\n\nPerceiving thus, he does not get agitated in what is not present.\n\n#### Agitation\n\nWhen this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, could there be agitation about something external that is not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said. \"Here, bhikkhu, it happens to some: 'I had it once, but I no longer have it; I want it, but I cannot obtain it.' They grieve, lament, weep, beat their breast, and become confused. Thus, bhikkhu, there is agitation about something external that is not present.\"\n\n\"But, venerable sir, could there be non-agitation about something external that is not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said. \"Here, bhikkhu, it does not happen to some: 'I had it once, but I no longer have it; I want it, but I cannot obtain it.' They do not grieve, do not lament, do not weep, do not beat their breast, and do not become confused. Thus, bhikkhu, there is non-agitation about something external that is not present.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, could there be agitation about something internal that is not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said. \"Here, bhikkhu, it happens to some: 'This world is the self, I shall be after death, permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity.' They hear a Tathāgata or a disciple of a Tathāgata teaching for the letting go of all standpoints for views, for the pacification of all formations, for the relinquishing of all acquisitions, for the wearing away of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbāna. It occurs to them: 'I shall be annihilated, I shall be destroyed, I shall not exist anymore.' They grieve, lament, weep, beat their breast, and become confused. Thus, bhikkhus, there is agitation about something internal that is not present.\"\n\n\"But, venerable sir, could there be non-agitation about something internal that in not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhus,\" the Blessed One replied. \"Here, bhikkhus, it does not happen to some: 'This world is the self, I shall be after death, permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity.' They hear a Tathāgata or a disciple of a Tathāgata teaching for the letting go of all standpoints for views, for the pacification of all formations, for the relinquishing of all acquisitions, for the wearing away of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbāna. It does not occur to them: 'I shall be annihilated, I shall be destroyed, I shall not exist anymore.' They do not grieve, do not lament, do not weep, do not beat their breast, and do not become confused. Thus, bhikkhus, there is non-agitation about something internal that is not present.\n\n#### Acquire a Permanent Possession\n\nBhikkhus, you could acquire that possession which is permanent, stable, eternal, of unchanging nature, and will endure as long as eternity. Do you see any possession, bhikkhus, that is permanent, stable, eternal, of unchanging nature, and will endure as long as eternity?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. I, too, do not see any possession, bhikkhus, that is permanent, stable, eternal, of unchanging nature, and will endure as long as eternity.\n\n#### Hold on to a Sorrow Free Self-View\n\nBhikkhus, you could hold on to a self-view, from which, if taken up, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise. Do you see, bhikkhus, any self-view which, if taken up and held on to, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. I, too, do not see any attachment to self-view, bhikkhus, from which, if taken up, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise.\n\nBhikkhus, you should depend on that view which, if depended on, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise. Do you see, bhikkhus, any view as a basis which, if depended on, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. I, too, do not see any view as a basis, bhikkhus, from which, if depended on, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise.\n\nOr, bhikkhus, if there were a self, would it be proper to think 'This belongs to me'?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Or, bhikkhus, if there were something belonging to self, would it be proper to think 'The self belongs to me'?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And, bhikkhus, if the self and what belongs to the self are not found to exist truly and firmly, then this view: 'This world is the self, I shall be after death, permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity,' is entirely and completely misguided, isn't it?\"\n\n\"How could it not be, venerable sir? Indeed, venerable sir, it is entirely and completely foolish.\"\n\n\"What do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\"\n\n\"Suffering, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, bhikkhus, is feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\"\n\n\"Suffering, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Any kind of feeling ... any kind of perception ... any kind of formations ... any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'\n\nSeeing thus, bhikkhus, the learned disciple of the noble ones becomes disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with formations, disenchanted with consciousness. Through disenchantment, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there is knowledge: 'Liberated.'\n\nHe understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\n#### The Arahant\n\nBhikkhus, this bhikkhu is called one who has lifted the barrier, one whose vision is unobstructed, one who has pulled out the dart, one without hindrances, a noble one who has lowered the banner, put down the burden, and is completely liberated.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu lift the barrier? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's ignorance is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lifts the barrier.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu have unobstructed vision? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's cycle of rebirths leading to repeated births is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has unobstructed vision.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu pull out the dart? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's craving is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu pulls out the dart.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become without hindrances? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's five lower fetters are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, annihilated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes without hindrances.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a noble one who has lowered the banner, put down the burden, and is completely liberated? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's conceit 'I am' is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a noble one who has lowered the banner, put down the burden, and is completely liberated.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu whose mind is liberated, the gods with Indra, with Brahmā, with Pajāpati, searching for that consciousness of the one thus gone, do not find it. And why is that? I declare, bhikkhus, that the one thus gone is not traceable in the present.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins falsely, baselessly, and wrongly accuse me, saying: 'The recluse Gotama is a proponent of annihilation, he teaches the destruction, the eradication, the non-existence of a being.' Yet, bhikkhus, as I do not say, as I do not declare, those respected recluses and brahmins falsely, baselessly, and wrongly accuse me, saying: 'The recluse Gotama is a proponent of annihilation, he teaches the destruction, the eradication, the non-existence of a being.' Formerly and now, bhikkhus, I declare only suffering and the cessation of suffering. Bhikkhus, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass the Tathāgata, there is no anger, no resentment, and no displeasure in the Tathāgata's mind.\n\nBhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate the Tathāgata, there is no joy, no gladness, and no elation in the Tathāgata's mind. Bhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate the Tathāgata, the Tathāgata thinks: 'This has been previously understood by me; such things happen.'\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass you, you should not harbor anger, resentment, or displeasure in your minds. Therefore, bhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate you, you should not harbor joy, gladness, or elation in your minds. Therefore, bhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate you, you should think: 'This has been previously understood by me; such things happen.'\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, abandon what is not yours; when you have abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is not yours? Form, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nFeeling, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Perception, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Formations, bhikkhus, are not yours, abandon them; having abandoned them, they will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Consciousness, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nWhat do you think, bhikkhus, if someone were to carry away the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves here in Jeta's Grove, or burn them, or do with them as they wish? Would it occur to you: 'They are carrying us away, burning us, or doing with us as they wish'?\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because, venerable sir, it is not self, nor what belongs to self.\"\n\n\"In the same way, bhikkhus, abandon what is not yours; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. And what, bhikkhus, is not yours? Form, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Feeling, bhikkhus ... Perception, bhikkhus ... Formations, bhikkhus ... Consciousness, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, there are those bhikkhus who are Arahants, with taints destroyed, who have lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, destroyed the fetters of becoming, and are completely liberated through final knowledge; there is no cycle for them to describe.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those bhikkhus who have abandoned the five lower fetters, all of them are spontaneously reborn, there they will attain final Nibbāna, not liable to return from that world.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those bhikkhus who have abandoned the three fetters, with greed, hatred, and delusion attenuated, all of them are once-returners, returning once more to this world, they will make an end of suffering.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those bhikkhus who have abandoned the three fetters, all of them are stream-enterers, not liable to fall into a lower state, fixed in their destiny, bound for full awakening.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, there are those bhikkhus who are followers of the Dhamma and followers of faith, all of them are bound for full awakening.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those who have mere faith and love in me, all of them are bound for heaven.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

What three? Here, bhikkhus, a Tathāgata, an Arahant, a perfectly enlightened Buddha arises in the world, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be trained, teacher of gods and humans, the enlightened one, the Blessed One. He teaches the Dhamma that is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with both the meaning and the phrasing; he proclaims the spiritual life that is entirely complete and pure. This, bhikkhus, is the first kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.\n\nAgain, bhikkhus, a disciple of that same teacher is an Arahant with taints exhausted, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved the highest goal, exhausted the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through right wisdom. He teaches the Dhamma that is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with both the meaning and the phrasing; he proclaims the spiritual life that is entirely complete and pure. This, bhikkhus, is the second kind of person who arises in the world for the welfare of the many, for the good of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and good of gods and humans.\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, a disciple of that same teacher who is a trainee, on the path, learned, and endowed with virtuous conduct.

They do not escape from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.

Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: 'Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort — my aspiration will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.'\n\nSimilarly, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort — my energy will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.\n\nSimilarly, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort — my mind will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.\n\nSimilarly, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort—my investigation will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, one experiences various kinds of psychic abilities: being one, one becomes many; being many, one becomes one; one appears and disappears; one passes through walls, enclosures, and mountains as though through space; one dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; one walks on water without sinking as though on solid ground; one flies through the air cross-legged like a bird with wings; one touches and strokes with one's hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; and one controls the body as far as the Brahmā (God) world.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, with the purified divine ear surpassing the human, one hears both kinds of sounds: divine and human, far and near.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, one understands the minds of other beings, other persons, having encompassed them with one's own mind. One knows a mind with lust as 'with lust,' and a mind without lust as 'without lust'; a mind with hate as 'with hate,' and a mind without hate as 'without hate'; a mind with delusion as 'with delusion,' and a mind without delusion as 'without delusion'; a contracted mind as 'contracted,' and a distracted mind as 'distracted'; a developed mind as 'developed,' and an undeveloped mind as 'undeveloped'; a surpassable mind as 'surpassable,' and an unsurpassable mind as 'unsurpassable'; a collected mind as 'collected,' and an uncollected mind as 'uncollected'; a liberated mind as 'liberated,' and an unliberated mind as 'unliberated.'\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, one recollects their manifold past lives: one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births; many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span; and passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span; and passing away from there, I was reborn here.' Thus with their aspects and particulars, one recollects their manifold past lives.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, with the purified divine eye surpassing the human, one sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and one understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus: 'These beings, who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. But these beings, who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the Noble Ones, who held right view and undertook actions under the influence of right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' Thus with the purified divine eye surpassing the human, one sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understands how beings pass on according to their actions.\n\nWhen these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, through the wearing away of the taints, one realizes for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.\""}]}

Mental phenomena (thoughts, emotions, memories, and perceptions) are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, mind-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, mind-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.\n\nWhatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Because, Ānanda, it is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, therefore, it is said, 'empty is the world'.\""}]}
