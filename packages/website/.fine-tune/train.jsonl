Sitting at one side, the venerable \u0100nanda said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Is there, venerable sir, one quality developed and frequently practiced that fulfills four qualities, the four qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill seven qualities, the seven qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill two qualities?\"\n\n\"There is, \u0100nanda, one quality developed and frequently practiced that fulfills four qualities, the four qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill seven qualities, the seven qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill two qualities.\"\n\n\"And what, venerable sir, is the one quality developed and frequently practiced that fulfills four qualities, the four qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill seven qualities, the seven qualities developed and frequently practiced fulfill two qualities?\"\n\n\"\u0100nanda, mindfulness of breathing when developed and frequently practiced fulfills the four establishments of mindfulness, the four establishments of mindfulness when developed and cultivated fulfill the seven factors of awakening, the seven factors of awakening when developed and cultivated, bring clear knowing and release to completion.\n\nHow is mindfulness of breathing developed, \u0100nanda, how is it frequently practiced to fulfill the four establishments of mindfulness? Here, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him. Mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.\n\n\"When, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu, breathing in long, knows 'I breathe in long', and breathing out long, knows 'I breathe out long'; breathing in short, knows 'I breathe in short', and breathing out short, knows 'I breathe out short'; he practices calming the bodily formations while breathing in, practices calming the bodily formations while breathing out \u2014 at that time, \u0100nanda, observing the body in the body, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished greed (desire, attachment) and displeasure (aversion, ill-will, resentment) with regard to the world. For what reason? Because of the in-and-out breaths. Therefore, \u0100nanda, in the (domain of) body, the bhikkhu at that time dwells observing the body in the body, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\n\"When, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu trains in breathing in feeling rapture, and in breathing out feeling rapture; trains in breathing in feeling ease, and in breathing out feeling ease; he trains in to calm mental formations while breathing in, and he trains in to calms mental formations while breathing out \u2014 at that time, \u0100nanda, dwelling in observing the feelings in feelings, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished craving and displeasure with regard to the world. For what reason? Because, \u0100nanda, I declare among feelings, this is crucial \u2014 careful attention to the in-and-out breaths. Therefore, \u0100nanda, in the (domain of) feelings, a bhikkhu at that time dwells observing feelings in feelings, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\n\"When, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu trains 'I will breathe in experiencing the mind', and 'I will breathe out experiencing the mind'; 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind', 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind'; 'I will breathe in concentrating the mind', 'I will breathe out concentrating the mind'; 'I will breathe in freeing the mind', 'I will breathe out freeing the mind' \u2014 at that time, \u0100nanda, observing the mind in the mind, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished craving and displeasure with regard to the world. For what reason? \u0100nanda, I do not speak of the cultivation of mindfulness of breathing for one forgetful and not fully aware. Therefore, \u0100nanda, in the (domain of) mind, a bhikkhu at that time dwells observing the mind in the mind, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\n\"When, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu observes impermanence while breathing in, and observes impermanence while breathing out; observes dispassion while breathing in, and observes dispassion while breathing out; observes cessation while breathing in, and observes cessation while breathing out; he trains to observe relinquishment while breathing in, and trains to observe relinquishment while breathing out \u2014 at that time, \u0100nanda, observing mental qualities within mental qualities, the bhikkhu resides with continuous effort, full awareness, and mindfulness, having relinquished craving and displeasure with regard to the world. For what reason? Because of careful attention to the in-and-out breaths. Therefore, \u0100nanda, in the (domain of) mental qualities, the bhikkhu at that time dwells observing mental qualities in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware, mindful, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.\"\n\nThus \u0100nanda, mindfulness of breathing when frequently practiced fulfills the four establishments of mindfulness.\n\n\"How, \u0100nanda, do the four foundations of mindfulness when frequently practiced fulfill the seven factors of awakening? When, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in the body, mindfulness is established in him at that time, unconfused. When, \u0100nanda, mindfulness is established in the bhikkhu, unconfused (clear), at that time the awakening factor of mindfulness is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, and the awakening factor of mindfulness in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\n\n\"While dwelling thus mindful, he investigates, explores, and fully examines that state. When, \u0100nanda, the bhikkhu, being thus mindful, investigates, explores, and fully examines that state, at that time the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena (dhamma) is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena, and the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena reaches the culmination of its development in the bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"When a bhikkhu with wisdom investigates, explores, and fully examines that state, persistence is aroused unflaggingly. When, \u0100nanda, for the bhikkhu, his examination of that state with wisdom leads to persistence, unfaltering, at that time, the awakening factor of energy is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of energy, and the awakening factor of energy reaches the culmination of its development in the bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"When, for a bhikkhu in whom persistence has aroused, an unworldly joy (rapture) arises, at that time, \u0100nanda, as the bhikkhu experiences unworldly joy from the persistence that has been aroused \u2014 the awakening factor of joy is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of joy, and the awakening factor of joy in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\n\n\"With joy in the mind, both the body and the mind relaxes. When, \u0100nanda, for the bhikkhu filled with joy, the body and the mind relaxes \u2014 the awakening factor of tranquility is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of tranquility, and the awakening factor of tranquility in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\n\n\"With the body tranquil (at ease) and the mind content, the mind becomes concentrated. When, \u0100nanda, for the bhikkhu, with a tranquil body and a content mind, the mind becomes concentrated \u2014 the awakening factor of collectedness is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of collectedness, and the awakening factor of collectedness in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\"\n\n\"With the mind well-concentrated, he closely observes. When, \u0100nanda, the bhikkhu, with his mind well-concentrated, closely observes \u2014 at that time, the awakening factor of equanimity (mental poise) is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of equanimity, and the awakening factor of equanimity in the bhikkhu reaches the culmination of its development.\"\n\n\"At that time, \u0100nanda, when a bhikkhu dwells observing feelings in feelings, the mind in the mind, mental qualities in mental qualities \u2014 mindfulness is established in him at that time, unconfused. At that time, \u0100nanda, when mindfulness is established in the bhikkhu, unconfused, at that time the awakening factor of mindfulness is aroused in the bhikkhu, he develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, and the awakening factor of mindfulness reaches the culmination of its development in the bhikkhu.\"\n\n[Similarly with the other three establishings of mindfulness: in feelings, mind, and mental qualities.]\n\n\"This is how \u0100nanda, when the four foundations of mindfulness are developed and cultivated, lead to fulfillment of the seven factors of awakening.\"\n\n\"And how are the seven factors of awakening developed and cultivated to lead to clear knowing and complete release? Here, \u0100nanda, a bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, maturing in release; the awakening factor of investigation of phenomena is developed ... the awakening factor of energy if developed ... the awakening factor of joy is developed ... the awakening factor of tranquility is developed ... the awakening factor of collectedness is developed ... the awakening factor of equanimity is developed, dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, maturing in release. This is how the seven factors of awakening, when developed and cultivated, lead to complete liberation by wisdom.\""}

Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.\n\nBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form cease; with the cessation of name-and-form, the six sense bases cease; with the cessation of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases; with the cessation of becoming, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus, there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.\n\nKnowing this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:\n\n\"When the nature of things becomes evident,\nto the Brahmin meditating with continuous effort;\nHe persists dispelling M\u0101ra's army,\nas the sun illuminating the sky."}

Then Moggall\u0101na the Accountant, a Brahmin, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After a cordial and meaningful conversation, he sat to one side. Seated to one side, the Accountant Moggall\u0101na said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Just as, dear Gotama, in this Mansion of Mig\u0101ra's Mother, one can see a gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progression \u2014 up to the final step on the staircase; just as among us Brahmins, there is a visible gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in our studies; just as among the archers, there is a visible gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in archery; so too, dear Gotama, for us accountants, whose livelihood is in accountancy, there is a visible gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in accountancy. When we receive a new pupil, we first make him calculate 'one ones, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens' and up to a hundred. Now, dear Gotama, is it possible to describe a similar gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress in your Dhamma and discipline?\"\n\n### Virtuous Conduct\n\n\"Indeed, Brahmin, it is possible to set forth a gradual training, practice, and practice in this Dhamma and discipline as well. Just as, Brahmin, a skilled horse trainer acquires a fine thoroughbred and initially trains it in the management of the bit, then proceeds to further training; similarly, dear Brahmin, the Tath\u0101gata initially trains a person thus: 'Come, bhikkhu, be virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the P\u0101timokkha (Bhikkhu's rules), endowed with conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and undertake and train in the precepts.'\n\n### Sense Restraint\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the P\u0101timokkha, endowed with conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and undertakes the training in the precepts, then the Tath\u0101gata further trains him: 'Come, bhikkhu, guard the doors of your sense faculties. Upon seeing a form with the eye, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the eye faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness (craving/desire/attachment with strong yearning and eagerness) and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the eye faculty, achieve mastery over it. In the same way, when hearing a sound with the ear, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the ear faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the ear faculty, achieve mastery over it. Similarly, when smelling an odor with the nose, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the nose faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the nose faculty, achieve mastery over it. Likewise, when tasting a flavor with the tongue, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the tongue faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the tongue faculty, achieve mastery over it. In the same manner, when feeling a tactile sensation with the body, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the body faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the body faculty, achieve mastery over it. Finally, when cognizing a mental object with the mind, do not grasp at its signs or features. If the mind faculty remains unguarded, detrimental unwholesome mental states such as covetousness and grief could overwhelm you. Practice restraint, guard the mind faculty, achieve mastery over it.'\n\n### Moderation in Eating\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu guards the doors of his sense faculties well, the Tath\u0101gata further trains him: 'Come, bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Consider wisely the food you consume \u2014 not for amusement, nor for indulgence, nor for physical appearance, nor for beautification, but only for the sustenance and maintenance of this body, for keeping it healthy, for aiding the spiritual life, thinking thus: 'I will allay old feelings of hunger without arousing new feelings, and so that I may be healthy and blameless and live in comfort.'\"\n\n### Dedication to Wakefulness\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is moderate in eating, the Tath\u0101gata further trains him: 'Come, bhikkhu, remain devoted to wakefulness. During the day, purify your mind from obstructive states through walking meditation and sitting meditation. During the first watch of the night, purify your mind in the same way; in the middle watch of the night, lie down on the right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your mind the idea of rising; in the last watch of the night, rise up and continue purifying your mind from obstructive states through walking meditation and sitting meditation.'\"\n\n### Mindfulness and Full Awareness\n\n\"When, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is devoted to wakefulness, the Tath\u0101gata further instructs him: 'Come, bhikkhu, be endowed with mindfulness and full awareness. Be fully aware when going forward and returning; be fully aware when looking ahead and looking away; be fully aware when bending and stretching; be fully aware when carrying the outer robe, the bowl and wearing robes; be fully aware when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; be fully aware when defecating and urinating; be fully aware when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent.'\n\n### Seclusion\n\nWhen, Brahmin, a bhikkhu is endowed with mindfulness and full awareness, the Tath\u0101gata further instructs him: 'Come, bhikkhu, dwell in a secluded lodging \u2014 in the forest, at the root of a tree, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in a jungle thicket, in an open space, or on a heap of straw.' Thus, he dwells in a secluded lodging \u2014 in the forest, at the root of a tree, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in a jungle thicket, in an open space, or on a heap of straw.\n\n#### Abandoning the Five Hindrances\n\nAfter his meal, having returned from the alms-round, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. He abandons covetousness for the world and lives with a mind rid of covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. He abandons ill-will and hatred, lives with a benevolent mind towards all beings, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill-will and hatred. He abandons dullness (complacency) and agitation, and lives alert and with full awareness; he purifies his mind from dullness (complacency) and agitation. He abandons restlessness (mental agitation) and remorse, lives tranquil and internally serene; he purifies his mind from restlessness (mental agitation) and remorse. He abandons doubt, lives having crossed over doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.\n\n#### Dwell in Jh\u0101nas\n\nHaving abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jh\u0101na, which includes applied thought and sustained thought (reflection and examination), with rapture (intense joy) and pleasure born of seclusion. With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters and dwells in the second jh\u0101na, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without reflection or examination, with rapture and pleasure born of collectedness. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells equanimous, mindful and fully aware; and he experiences in his own person that bliss of which the noble ones say: 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' Thus, he enters and dwells in the third jh\u0101na. With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and displeasure, he enters and dwells in the fourth jh\u0101na, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.\n\nThose bhikkhus, Brahmin, who are trainees, aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage, abide thus. But those bhikkhus who are arahants, who have exhausted the taints, who have lived the spiritual life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained their true goal, utterly exhausted the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, for them these teachings lead to dwelling in ease here and to mindfulness and full awareness.\"\n\n### Who Attains Nibb\u0101na\n\nThus having spoken, the Brahmin Accountant Moggall\u0101na asked the Blessed One: \"dear Gotama, do all your disciples who are instructed and guided by you in this way attain final Nibb\u0101na without exception, or do some not attain it?\"\n\n\"Some of my disciples, Brahmin, being instructed and guided by me in this manner, attain final Nibb\u0101na, the ultimate goal, while others do not.\"\n\n\"What is the cause, dear Gotama, and what is the reason that while Nibb\u0101na exists, the path leading to Nibb\u0101na exists, and you, Gotama, are present to encourage, yet when instructed and guided by you, some of your disciples attain final Nibb\u0101na, the ultimate goal, while others do not?\"\n\n\"Then, Brahmin, let me ask you a question in return. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, Brahmin, are you skilled in the path to Rajagaha?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gotama, I am skilled in the path to Rajagaha.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Brahmin, if a man came to you wishing to go to Rajagaha, and said, 'Sir, I wish to go to Rajagaha; show me the way there.' You would tell him, 'This is the way, go in this direction, and after a while, you will see such and such a village, continue and you will see such and such a town, proceed further and you will find yourself in delightful parks, forests, and lands around Rajagaha.' If, after being instructed by you, this person were to take a wrong turn and go backwards, whereas another person, following your instructions, reaches Rajagaha safely, what is the cause, Brahmin, what is the reason why, despite the path to Rajagaha and your instructions, one person goes astray and another reaches Rajagaha?\"\n\n\"What can I do, Gotama, in that situation? I am only the one who shows the way.\"\n\n\"Similarly, Brahmin, Nibb\u0101na exists, the path leading to Nibb\u0101na exists, and I am here to instruct; yet my disciples, being instructed and guided by me, some attain final Nibb\u0101na and some do not. What can I do, Brahmin? I am only the one who shows the way.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Brahmin Accountant Moggall\u0101na said to the Blessed One: \"There are those, dear Gotama, who lack faith, who have left the household life for a livelihood, not out of faith. They are deceitful, insincere, boastful, impudent, unstable, garrulous, unrestrained in their senses, indulgent in food, and not devoted to wakefulness. They do not respect training, are careless, trivial, and lead the spiritual life with a motive of gaining position. They are lazy, lacking energy, forgetful, lacking mindfulness, uncollected, with their minds scattered, and lacking wisdom. These, dear Gotama, do not live in close association with you.\n\nBut those clansmen who have left the household life out of faith, who are not deceitful, insincere, or boastful, who are not impudent, unstable, or garrulous, who guard their senses, are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, regard training highly, and strive earnestly in the spiritual life \u2014 these, dear Gotama, do live in close association with you.\n\nJust as among roots, black pepper is reckoned as the best, among scents the red sandalwood, and among flowers the jasmine; similarly, your advice is supreme among the highest truths.\n\nWonderful, dear Gotama, wonderful, dear Gotama! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, reveal what was hidden, point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in various ways you have made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha. From today, let the Blessed Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.\""}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus responded to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"I will teach you the dependent co-arising. Listen well and pay close attention, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus responded to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"And what, bhikkhus, is dependent co-arising? With ignorance as condition, bhikkhus, volitions [formations]; with volitions as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging (grasping); with clinging (grasping) as condition, continued existence; with continued existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. This is the origin (arising) of this whole mass of suffering. This is called, bhikkhus, dependent co-arising.\n\nWith the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitions; with the cessation of volitions, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of continued existence; with the cessation of continued existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. This is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

There, the Blessed One addressed the group of five bhikkhus:\n\n\"Bhikkhus, two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth. Which two? That which is pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures, which is low, vulgar, common, ignoble, and unbeneficial; and that which is pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. Avoiding both these extremes, bhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata has awakened to the Middle Way, which gives rise to vision, gives rise to knowledge, leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tath\u0101gata, which gives rise to vision, gives rise to knowledge, leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na? It is this Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness. This, bhikkhus, is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tath\u0101gata, which gives rise to vision, gives rise to knowledge, leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering (discontentment, stress): birth is suffering, aging is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering; association with the unpleasant is suffering, separation from the pleasant is suffering, not getting what one desires is suffering \u2014 in summary, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the arising of suffering: it is this craving which leads to rebirth, accompanied by delight and lust, finding delight here and there; namely, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for non-existence.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading and cessation of that same craving, the forsaking and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, absence of reliance on it.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path; namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\n'In regards to the noble truth of suffering', bhikkhus, vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of suffering should be fully comprehended', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of suffering has been fully comprehended', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\n'In regards to the noble truth of the arising of suffering', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of the arising of suffering should be abandoned', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of the arising of suffering has been abandoned', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\n'In regards to this noble truth of the cessation of suffering', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\n'In regards to this noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering should be developed', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\nAs long as my knowledge and vision regarding these Four Noble Truths in their three phases and twelve aspects was not fully purified, I did not claim to have achieved the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its deities (devas), M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101 (God), with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.\n\nBut when my knowledge and vision regarding these four noble truths in their three phases and twelve aspects was fully purified, then I claimed to have achieved the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its deities, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.\n\nAnd knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakeable is my liberation, this is my last birth, there is no more rebirth for me.'\"\n\nThis the Blessed One said. Satisfied, the group of five bhikkhus rejoiced in what the Blessed One had said.\n\nMoreover, while this exposition was being given, the venerable Konda\u00f1\u00f1a's mind was freed from the taints through the absence of clinging: \"Whatever arises is subject to cessation.\"\n\nWhen the Blessed One had set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion, the earth-bound deities proclaimed: \"At Varanasi, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, the Unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, not to be halted by any ascetic, brahmin, deities, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone in the world.\"\n\nHearing the earth-bound deities, the deities of the Four Great Kings\u2026 the T\u0101vati\u1e41sa deities\u2026 the Y\u0101ma deities\u2026 the Tusita deities\u2026 the Nimm\u0101narat\u012b deities\u2026 the Paranimmitavasavatt\u012b deities\u2026 the Brahm\u0101s joined in: \"At Varanasi, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, the Unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, not to be halted by any ascetic, brahmin, deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101 (God), or anyone in the world.\"\n\nThus, at that moment, that instant, that second, the cry reached as far as the Brahm\u0101 world, and this ten-thousandfold universe shook, quaked, and trembled, and a boundless, splendid radiance surpassed the divine majesty of the deities.\n\nThen the Blessed One declared: \"Truly, Konda\u00f1\u00f1a has realized! Truly, Konda\u00f1\u00f1a has realized!\"\n\nThus, Venerable Konda\u00f1\u00f1a became known as \"A\u00f1\u00f1a Konda\u00f1\u00f1a\u2014Konda\u00f1\u00f1a Who Has Realized.\""}

Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu does not overcome arisen loss, fame, disrepute, honor, dishonor, evil wishes, or evil friendship while dwelling, defilements that are troublesome and afflictive would arise. If he overcomes arisen evil friendship while dwelling, then those defilements that are troublesome and afflictive do not arise. Bhikkhus, this is the reason a bhikkhu should overcome arisen acquisitions and dwell, to overcome arisen loss, arisen fame, arisen disrepute, arisen honor, arisen dishonor, arisen evil wishes, arisen evil friendship and dwell.\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We will overcome arisen acquisitions and dwell, we will overcome arisen loss, arisen fame, arisen disrepute, arisen honor, arisen dishonor, arisen evil wishes, arisen evil friendship and dwell.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train.\""}

Then, while the venerable So\u1e47a was alone in seclusion, the following thought arose in his mind: \"Indeed, all the Blessed One's disciples who live with energy aroused are like me. Yet my mind is not released from the defilements without clinging. I have wealth in my family; it is possible to enjoy the wealth and to do meritorious deeds. What if I were to abandon the training, return to the lay life, enjoy wealth, and do meritorious deeds?\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, knowing the thought in the venerable So\u1e47a's mind \u2014 as easily as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm \u2014 disappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain and appeared in front of the venerable So\u1e47a in the Cool Grove. The Blessed One sat down on a prepared seat. The venerable So\u1e47a paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.\n\nThe Blessed One said to the venerable So\u1e47a: \"So\u1e47a, when you were alone in seclusion, did this thought arise in your mind: 'Indeed, all the Blessed One's disciples who live with aroused energy are like me. Yet my mind is not released from the defilements without clinging. I have wealth in my family; it is possible to enjoy the wealth and to do meritorious deeds. What if I were to abandon the training, return to the lay life, enjoy wealth, and do meritorious deeds?'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, So\u1e47a, were you not skilled in playing the lute (sit\u0101r) when you were a householder?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, So\u1e47a, when the strings of your lute were too tight, was your lute at that time harmonious and playable?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, So\u1e47a, when the strings of your lute were too loose, was your lute at that time harmonious and playable?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But when the strings of your lute were neither too tight nor too loose but tuned to the middle pitch, was your lute then harmonious and playable?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Similarly, So\u1e47a, excessive energy leads to restlessness, and too little energy leads to laziness. Therefore, So\u1e47a, resolve on balanced energy, break through to a balanced state of the faculties, and pay attention to that sign.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the venerable So\u1e47a replied.\n\nThen the Blessed One, having instructed the venerable So\u1e47a with this advice \u2014 as easily as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm \u2014 disappeared from the Cool Grove and appeared on Vulture Peak Mountain.\n\nThen the venerable So\u1e47a, after a while, resolved on balanced energy, had a break through to a balanced state of the faculties, and paid attention to that sign. Then the venerable So\u1e47a, living alone, diligent, with continuous effort, and resolute, soon realized for himself, through direct knowledge, that ultimate goal of the spiritual life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, knowing and realizing it for himself, he abided in it.\n\nHe directly knew: \"Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" And the venerable So\u1e47a became one of the arahants.\n\nThen the venerable So\u1e47a, having attained arahantship, thought: \"Let me now approach the Blessed One and declare my attainment of arahantship.\" Then the venerable So\u1e47a approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the venerable So\u1e47a said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, the bhikkhu who is an arahant, whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge, is established in six things \u2014 he is established in renunciation (giving up of sensual pleasures), established in seclusion, established in harmlessness, established in non-craving, established in non-clinging, and established in non-delusion (fully aware with mental clarity and unconfused, established in close examination and verification).\n\nThere might be, however, venerable sir, for some venerable one, this thought: 'This venerable one is established in renunciation only on account of mere faith.' Indeed, venerable sir, this should not be viewed thus. The bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, seeing no more duties of his own or any accumulation of the done, due to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, is established in renunciation; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, is established in renunciation; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, is established in renunciation.\n\nThere might be, however, venerable sir, for some venerable one, this thought: 'This venerable one is established in seclusion only for the sake of gain, honor, and fame.' Indeed, venerable sir, this should not be viewed thus. The bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, seeing no more duties of his own or any accumulation of the done, due to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, is established in seclusion; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, is established in seclusion; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, is established in seclusion.\n\nThere might be, however, venerable sir, for some venerable one, this thought: 'This venerable one is established in harmlessness only due to attachment to rules and observances.' Indeed, venerable sir, this should not be viewed thus. The bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, seeing no more duties of his own or any accumulation of the done, due to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, is established in harmlessness; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, is established in harmlessness; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, is established in harmlessness.\n\nDue to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, one is established in non-craving; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, one is established in non-craving; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, one is established in non-craving.\n\nDue to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, one is established in non-clinging; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, one is established in non-clinging; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, one is established in non-clinging.\n\nDue to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, one is established in non-delusion; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, one is established in non-delusion; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, one is established in non-delusion.\n\nThus, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu whose mind is rightly liberated, even if many forms cognizable by the eye come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena. Even if many sounds cognizable by the ear, odors cognizable by the nose, tastes cognizable by the tongue, tactile objects cognizable by the body, or mental phenomena (ideas, feelings, thoughts) cognizable by the mind come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena.\n\nJust as, venerable sir, a solid rock mountain, unbroken and without hollows, one solid mass, would not be shaken, disturbed, or cause to tremble by a heavy storm of wind and rain coming from the east, the west, the north, or the south;\n\nJust so, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu whose mind is rightly liberated, even if many forms cognizable by the eye come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena. Even if many sounds cognizable by the ear, odors cognizable by the nose, tastes cognizable by the tongue, tactile objects cognizable by the body, or mental phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena.\n\nFor one established in renunciation,\nand the seclusion of mind;\nestablished in non-ill will,\nand the destruction of clinging.\n\nFor one established in the wearing away of craving,\nand non-delusion of mind;\nSeeing the arising of phenomena,\nthe mind is rightly liberated.\n\nFor him rightly liberated,\nthe bhikkhu with a peaceful mind;\nThere is no accumulation of deeds,\nand no more tasks remain to be done.\n\nJust as a solid rock,\nis not shaken by the wind;\nSo forms, tastes, sounds,\nodors, and tactile sensations, all.\n\nDesirable and undesirable phenomena,\ndo not disturb one who is such;\nThe steady mind, fully liberated,\nsees the impermanence of all."}

Venerable S\u0101riputta said:\n\n\"'Right view, right view,' is said, friends. To what extent, friends, does a noble disciple possess right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma?\"\n\n\"Even from far away, friend, we would come to learn the meaning of this statement from the presence of Venerable S\u0101riputta. It would be good if Venerable S\u0101riputta himself would clarify the meaning of this statement. After hearing it from Venerable S\u0101riputta, the bhikkhus will remember it.\"\n\n\"Then listen, friends, and pay close attention, I will speak,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" those bhikkhus replied to Venerable S\u0101riputta. Venerable S\u0101riputta said:\n\n### The Unwholesome and the Wholesome\n\n\"When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome \u2014 to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\n\nWhat, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the unwholesome, what is the wholesome, what is the root of the wholesome? Taking life, friends, is unwholesome; taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, covetousness, ill-will, and wrong view \u2014 this, friends, is called unwholesome.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the root of the unwholesome? Passion (lust, desire, attachment) is an unwholesome root, aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment) is an unwholesome root, delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification) is an unwholesome root\u2014 this, friends, is called the root of the unwholesome.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the wholesome? Abstaining from taking life is wholesome, abstaining from taking what is not given, abstaining from sexual misconduct, abstaining from lying, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from harsh speech, abstaining from idle chatter, non-covetousness, good-will, and right view \u2014 this, friends, is called wholesome.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the root of the wholesome? Contentment is a wholesome root, good-will is a wholesome root, wisdom (choosing to carefully examine and independently verify) is a wholesome root \u2014 this, friends, is called the root of the wholesome.\n\nWhen, friends, a noble disciple thus understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to passion, dispels the underlying tendency to aversion, eradicates the underlying tendency to the view 'I am', by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge, in this very life makes an end of suffering (discontentment, stress) \u2014 to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\"\n\n\"Good, friend!\" those bhikkhus satisfied and rejoiced in Venerable S\u0101riputta's words, and then they asked him a further question: \"Might there be another way in which a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma?\"\n\n### Nutriment\n\n\"There might be, friends. When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment and the origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the path leading to the cessation of nutriment \u2014 to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\n\nWhat, friends, is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, what is the cessation of nutriment, what is the path leading to the cessation of nutriment? There are these four nutriments, friends, for the maintenance of beings that have come to be and for the support of those seeking to be. What are the four? Edible food, coarse or fine, is the first, contact is the second, mental volition is the third, and consciousness is the fourth. The origin of nutriment is craving, the cessation of nutriment is the cessation of craving, and the noble eightfold path is the path leading to the cessation of nutriment, namely \u2014 right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen, friends, a noble disciple thus understands nutriment, the origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the path leading to the cessation of nutriment, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to passion, dispels the underlying tendency to aversion, eradicates the underlying tendency to the view 'I am', by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge, in this very life makes an end of suffering (discontentment, stress) \u2014 to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\"\n\n\"Good, friend!\" those bhikkhus satisfied and rejoiced in Venerable S\u0101riputta's words, and then they asked him a further question: \"Might there be another way in which a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma?\"\n\n### The Four Noble Truths\n\n\"There might be, friends. When, friends, a noble disciple understands suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering \u2014 to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma. What, friends, is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, what is the cessation of suffering, what is the path leading to the cessation of suffering? Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering, separation from the liked is suffering, not getting what one wants is also suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging (grasping/holding on) are suffering \u2014 this, friends, is called suffering. And what, friends, is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which leads to rebirth, accompanied by pleasure and lust, finding delight here and there; namely, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for non-existence \u2014 this, friends, is called the origin of suffering. And what, friends, is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading and cessation of that same craving, the forsaking and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it \u2014 this, friends, is called the cessation of suffering. And what, friends, is the path leading to the cessation of suffering? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness \u2014 this, friends, is called the path leading to the cessation of suffering.\n\nWhen, friends, a noble disciple thus understands suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to passion, dispels the underlying tendency to aversion, eradicates the underlying tendency to the view 'I am', by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge, in this very life makes an end of suffering\u2014 to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\"\n\n\"Good, friends!\" those bhikkhus, having satisfied and rejoiced in Venerable S\u0101riputta's words, asked him a further question: \"Might there be another way in which a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma?\"\n\n### Aging and Death\n\n\"There might be, friends. When, friends, a noble disciple understands aging and death, the origin of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, and the path leading to the cessation of aging and death \u2014 to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma. What, friends, is aging and death, what is the origin of aging and death, what is the cessation of aging and death, what is the path leading to the cessation of aging and death? The aging of various beings in their respective classes, the decline, the breaking down of faculties, the wearing out of the body, the weakening of vitality \u2014 this, friends, is called aging. And what, friends, is death?

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:\n\n### Not Eating At Night\n\n\"Bhikkhus, I eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By not eating at night, I experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Therefore, bhikkhus, you too should eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By not eating at night, you will experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One.\n\nThen, while wandering in stages through the K\u0101s\u012b region, the Blessed One arrived at a K\u0101s\u012b town of K\u012b\u1e6d\u0101giri. There, the Blessed One stayed in this K\u0101s\u012b town, K\u012b\u1e6d\u0101giri.\n\nAt that time, a group of bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at K\u012b\u1e6d\u0101giri. Then, several bhikkhus went to visit these bhikkhus and said to them: \"Friends, the Blessed One eats only during the day, without having a meal at night, and the bhikkhu sa\u1e45gha does the same. By not eating at night, they experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Therefore, friends, you too should eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By doing so, you will experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.\"\n\nWhen this was said, the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka said to those bhikkhus: \"Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside of the proper time. By eating in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time, we experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Why should we abandon what is evident and pursue what is uncertain? We will continue to eat in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time.\"\n\nWhen the bhikkhus were unable to convince the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, they went to the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, we went to the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka; having approached, we said to them: 'Friends, the Blessed One only eats during the day, without having a meal at night, and the bhikkhu sa\u1e45gha does the same; by not eating at night, they experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Therefore, friends, you too should abstain from eating at night. By so doing, you too will experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.' When this was said, venerable sir, the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka said to us: 'Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside of the proper time. By eating in the evening, morning, and during the day, we experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Why should we abandon what is evident and pursue what is uncertain? We will continue to eat in the evening, morning, and during the day.' Since we could not convince the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, venerable sir, we have come to inform the Blessed One of this matter.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: \"Come, bhikkhu, in my name, call the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, saying: 'The teacher calls you, venerables.'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu replied. Then that bhikkhu, having answered the Blessed One, approached the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka; having approached them, he said, \"The teacher calls you, venerables.\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka replied to that bhikkhu, and they approached the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, they sat down to one side. After they sat to one side, the Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Is it true, bhikkhus, that several bhikkhus approached you and said: 'The Blessed One and the community of bhikkhus eat only during the day, without having a meal at night; by not eating at night, they experience fewer ailments, fewer illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Come, friends, you too should eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By not eating at night, you too will experience fewer ailments, fewer illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.' And when this was said, bhikkhus, did you respond to those bhikkhus: 'Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside of the proper time. By eating in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time, we experience fewer ailments, fewer illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Why should we abandon what is evident and pursue what is uncertain? We will continue to eat in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time.'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n### Feelings and Unwholesome and Wholesome States\n\n\"Bhikkhus, do you understand me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this: 'Whatever this person experiences, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Surely, bhikkhus, do you understand the Dhamma as I have taught it: that in the case of some person, experiencing a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish; but in the case of another person, experiencing a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase. In the case of some person, experiencing a painful feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish; but in the case of another person, experiencing a painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase. In the case of some person, experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish; but in the case of another person, experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n#### Pleasant Feelings\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. And if it were unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom thus: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say: 'Abandon such a pleasant feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' therefore I say, 'Abandon such a pleasant feeling.' If it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Dwell experiencing such a pleasant feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' therefore I say, 'Dwell experiencing such a pleasant feeling.'\n\n#### Painful Feelings\n\nIf it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Abandon such a painful feeling'?\"\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' therefore I say, 'Abandon such a painful feeling.' If it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Dwell experiencing such a painful feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' therefore I say, 'Dwell experiencing such a painful feeling.'\n\n#### Neither-Painful-Nor-Pleasant Feelings\n\nIf it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Abandon such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling'?\u201d\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' therefore I say, 'Abandon such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.' If it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Dwell experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' therefore I say, 'Dwell experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nBhikkhus, I do not say to all bhikkhus, 'You must act with diligence'; nor do I say to all bhikkhus, 'You must not act with diligence.' Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are arahants, whose taints are exhausted, who have lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, exhausted the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, I do not say to such bhikkhus, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because their diligence has been accomplished. They are incapable of negligence.\n\nBut, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are trainees, not yet attained to their goal, but who are striving for the unsurpassed safety from bondage, to such bhikkhus I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, it is possible that by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing their faculties, those venerable ones might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with their own direct knowledge, they might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for these bhikkhus, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\"\n\n### Seven Kinds of Persons\n\n\"Bhikkhus, there are seven kinds of persons to be found existing in the world. What seven? They are: one liberated both ways, one liberated by wisdom, a body-witness, one attained through view, one attained through confidence, a Dhamma-follower, and a faith-follower.\n\n#### 1. Liberated Both Ways\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of a person is one liberated both ways? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person contacts with the body and dwells in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, and by having seen with wisdom, his taints are exhausted. This kind of a person is called one liberated both ways. For such a bhikkhu, I do not say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because his diligence has been accomplished. He is incapable of negligence.\n\n#### 2. Liberated by Wisdom\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is one liberated by wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms; however, having seen with wisdom, his taints are exhausted. This person is called one liberated by wisdom. For this bhikkhu too, I do not say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because his diligence has been accomplished. He is incapable of negligence.\n\n#### 3. Body-Witness\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is a body-witness? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person contacts with the body and dwells in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, and by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted. This person is called a body-witness. For this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\"\n\n#### 4. Attained Through View\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is one attained through view? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, but by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted, and the teachings proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata are understood and practiced by him with wisdom. This person is called one attained through view. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n#### 5. Attained Through Confidence\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is one attained through confidence? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, but by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted, and his confidence in the Tath\u0101gata is deeply rooted and well-established. This person is called one attained through confidence. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n#### 6. A Dhamma-Follower\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is a Dhamma-follower? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, but by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted, and the teachings proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata are understood and practiced by him with wisdom to some extent. Moreover, he possesses the faculties of confidence, persistence (energy), mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. This person is called a Dhamma-follower. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n#### 7. A Faith-Follower\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is a faith-follower? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms. By having seen with wisdom, his taints are not exhausted, and he has mere faith and love for the Tath\u0101gata. Moreover, he possesses the faculties of confidence, persistence, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. This person is called a faith-follower. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n### Final Knowledge Is Attained Gradually\n\nBhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is attained immediately at the first attempt. However, bhikkhus, it is through gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress that final knowledge is attained.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, is final knowledge attained through gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress? Here, bhikkhus, someone who has faith approaches [a teacher]; having approached, he attends on [the teacher]; attending on him, he lends ear; having lent ear, he hears the Dhamma; having heard the Dhamma, he remembers (memorizes) it; he examines the meaning of the teachings he has remembered; when he examines their meaning, he gains a reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained reflective acceptance of those teachings, aspiration (interest/desire/zeal) springs up in him; when aspiration has sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his will, he scrutinizes; having scrutinized, he strives; resolutely striving, he realizes with the body the ultimate truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.\n\nThere has not been that faith, bhikkhus, and there has not been that approaching, and there has not been that attending, and there has not been that lending ear, and there has not been that hearing of the Dhamma, and there has not been that remembering of the Dhamma, and there has not been that examination of the meaning, and there has not been that reflective acceptance of the teachings, and there has not been that aspiration, and there has not been that application of will, and there has not been that scrutiny, and there has not been that striving. Bhikkhus, you have lost your way; bhikkhus, you have been practising the wrong way. Just how far, bhikkhus, have these misguided men strayed from this teaching and training.\n\nBhikkhus, there is a four-phrased statement, and when it is understood, a wise person would quickly comprehend its meaning. Shall I declare it to you, bhikkhus, so you can understand it?\"\n\n\"And who are we, venerable sir, that we should understand the Dhamma?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, even with a teacher who is concerned with worldly things, inheritor of worldly things, involved with worldly things, such haggling by his disciples would not be proper: 'If it were like this for us, then we would do it; if it were not like this for us, then we would not do it'; how much more so when the teacher is the Tath\u0101gata, who dwells completely detached from worldly things?\n\n\"Bhikkhus, for a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, it is natural that he conduct himself thus: 'The Blessed One is the Teacher, I am a disciple; the Blessed One knows, I do not know.' For a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, the Teacher's instruction becomes nourishing and is suitable for growth. Furthermore, for a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, it is natural that he conduct himself thus: 'Even if my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and my flesh and blood dry up, I will not let the energy for striving stop until I have attained what can be attained by human strength, human energy, and human persistence.' Bhikkhus, for a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, one of two fruits is to be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a trace of clinging left, the state of non-returning.\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"What, bhikkhus, is the domain of a person without integrity? A person without integrity, bhikkhus, is ungrateful and does not acknowledge the help given to them. It is recognized, bhikkhus, as the mark of a person without integrity to be ungrateful and to not acknowledge what has been done for them. This, bhikkhus, is the entirety of the domain of a person without integrity: ungratefulness and not acknowledging what has been done for them. And what, bhikkhus, is the domain of a person with integrity? A person with integrity, bhikkhus, is grateful and acknowledges the help given to them. It is recognized, bhikkhus, as the mark of a person with integrity to be grateful and to acknowledge what has been done for them. This, bhikkhus, is the entirety of the domain of a person with integrity: gratitude and acknowledging what has been done for them.\"\n\n## 2.33\n\n\"Bhikkhus, I say there are two people who are not easy to repay. Which two? One's mother and father.\n\nEven if a person were to carry one's mother on one shoulder and one's father on the other shoulder and live for a hundred years, and if they were to attend to them by anointing, massaging, bathing, and rubbing their limbs, even if they were to defecate and urinate right there, still, bhikkhus, they would not have done enough for their parents, nor would they have repaid them.\n\nAnd even if one were to establish their parents in sovereign authority over this great earth, abounding in wealth and treasures, still, bhikkhus, they would not have done enough for their parents, nor would they have repaid them. Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, parents are of great help to their children; they bring them up, nourish them, and show them the world.\n\nBut, bhikkhus, if one encourages, settles, and establishes their unbelieving parents in experiential confidence (faith), their immoral parents in ethical conduct, their stingy parents in generosity, and their foolish parents in wisdom \u2014 in this way, bhikkhus, one has done enough for their parents and repaid them.\"\n\n## 2.34\n\nThen a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One, and having approached, exchanged greetings with him. When the courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One, \"What does Venerable Gotama teach? What does he declare?\"\n\n\"I teach action and I teach non-action, brahmin.\"\n\n\"How, Venerable Gotama, do you teach action and non-action?\"\n\n\"I teach, brahmin, the non-action of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct, and of all sorts of evil and unwholesome qualities. And I teach the action of bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, mental good conduct, and of all sorts of wholesome qualities. Thus, brahmin, I teach action and non-action.\"\n\n\"Excellent, Venerable Gotama! ... Please consider me as a lay follower who has gone to you for refuge from this day forth for life.\"\n\n## 2.35\n\nThen the householder An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika approached the Blessed One, and having approached, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the householder An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, how many persons are worthy of offerings in the world? Where should gifts be given?\"\n\n\"Householder, there are two persons in the world who are worthy of offerings \u2014 the trainee and the arahant. These are the two persons worthy of offerings in the world, and gifts should be given to them.\"\n\nThis is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One further said:\n\n\"The trainee and the arahant in this world,\nAre worthy of offerings from those who make offerings;\nThey are upright in body,\nin speech, and in mind;\nThat field for those who make offerings\nGives great fruit.\"\n\n## 2.36\n\nThus have I heard \u2014 at one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at S\u0101vatthi in the Jeta's Grove, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika's park.\n\nAt that time, the Venerable S\u0101riputta was dwelling at S\u0101vatthi in the Eastern park, in Mig\u0101ra's mother's mansion. There, the Venerable S\u0101riputta addressed the bhikkhus, saying: \"Friends, bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" they responded to the Venerable S\u0101riputta. The Venerable S\u0101riputta said:\n\n\"I will explain to you, friends, the person with internal fetters and the person with external fetters. Listen to it, attend carefully, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" the bhikkhus responded to Venerable S\u0101riputta. The Venerable S\u0101riputta said:\n\n\"And what, friends, is the person with internal fetters? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the precepts, accomplished in conduct and field of activity, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and having undertaken the training rules, trains in them. After breaking up of the body, beyond death, he arises in a certain heavenly realm. From there, having fallen away, he returns to this world. This is called, friends, the person with internal fetters who returns to this world.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the person with external fetters? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the precepts, accomplished in conduct and field of activity, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and having undertaken the training rules, trains in them. He arrives at and dwells in a certain peaceful release of mind. After breaking up of the body, beyond death, he arises in a certain heavenly realm. From there, having fallen away, he becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world. This is called, friends, the person with external fetters who becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world.\n\nFurthermore, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the precepts, accomplished in conduct and field of activity, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and having undertaken the training rules, trains in them. He is engaged for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of sensual pleasures. He is engaged for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of existence. He is engaged for the ending of craving. He is engaged for the ending of greed. After breaking up the body, beyond death, he arises in a certain heavenly realm. From there, having fallen away, he becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world. This is called, friends, the person with external fetters who becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world.\"\n\nThen many equanimous deities approached the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, those deities said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, the Venerable S\u0101riputta is teaching the bhikkhus at the Eastern park, in Mig\u0101ra's mother's mansion, about the person with internal fetters and the person with external fetters. The assembly is joyful. Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One, out of compassion, would approach the Venerable S\u0101riputta.\" The Blessed One consented by silence.\n\nThen the Blessed One \u2014 just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm \u2014 disappeared from Jeta's Grove and reappeared in the Eastern park, in Mig\u0101ra's mother's mansion, in front of the Venerable S\u0101riputta. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. The Venerable S\u0101riputta also paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to the Venerable S\u0101riputta:\n\n\"Here, S\u0101riputta, many equanimous deities approached me; having approached, they paid homage to me and stood to one side. Standing to one side, those deities said to me: 'Venerable sir, the Venerable S\u0101riputta is teaching the bhikkhus at the Eastern park, in Mig\u0101ra's mother's mansion, about the person with internal fetters and the person with external fetters. The assembly is joyful. Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One, out of compassion, would approach the Venerable S\u0101riputta.'\n\nHowever, S\u0101riputta, those deities, even when they become ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, even at the tip of a needle, they stand without obstructing each other.\n\nIt might be, however, S\u0101riputta, one might think thus: 'Surely, the minds of those deities are so developed that even when they become ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, they stand at the tip of a needle without obstructing each other.' However, S\u0101riputta, this should not be seen in this way. Here itself, S\u0101riputta, the minds of those deities became so developed that even when they become ten ... and do not obstruct each other.\"\n\nTherefore, S\u0101riputta, you should train thus: 'We will be calm in faculties, calm in mind.' Thus, you should train, S\u0101riputta. For in those with calm faculties and calm minds, only calm bodily action, calm verbal action, and calm mental action will arise. We will offer only calm offerings to our fellow practitioners. Thus, you should train, S\u0101riputta.\n\nIndeed, S\u0101riputta, the wanderers of other sects will not hear this teaching of the Dhamma.\"\n\n## 2.37\n\nThus have I heard \u2014 at one time, the Venerable Mah\u0101kacc\u0101na was dwelling in Vara\u1e47\u0101, on the banks of the Bhaddas\u0101ri River.\n\nThen, the brahmin \u0100r\u0101mada\u1e47\u1e0da approached the Venerable Mah\u0101kacc\u0101na and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side. Seated there, the brahmin \u0100r\u0101mada\u1e47\u1e0da said to the Venerable Mah\u0101kacc\u0101na:\n\n\"What, good Kacc\u0101na, is the reason, what is the cause, why kshatriyas quarrel with kshatriyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders?\"\n\n\"Brahmin, it is because of their attachment to sensual desire, their clinging to sensual desire, their engagement with sensual desire, their bondage to sensual desire, and their obsession with sensual desire that kshatriyas quarrel with kshatriyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders.\"\n\n\"What, good Kacc\u0101na, is the reason, what is the cause, why ascetics quarrel with ascetics?\"\n\n\"Brahmin, it is because of their attachment to views, their clinging to views, their engagement with views, their bondage to views, and their obsession with views that ascetics quarrel with ascetics.\"\n\n\"Is there anyone, good Kacc\u0101na, in the world who has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views?\"\n\n\"There is, brahmin, someone in the world who has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views.\"\n\n\"Who, good Kacc\u0101na, is that person in the world who has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views?\"\n\n\"There is, brahmin, in the eastern regions, a city called S\u0101vatthi. There, the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is now living. He, brahmin, the Blessed One, has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views.\"\n\nWhen this was said, the brahmin \u0100r\u0101mada\u1e47\u1e0da rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and placing his right knee on the ground, he bowed down with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, and said three times:\n\n\"Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!\n\nHomage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!\n\nHomage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!\n\nIndeed, the Blessed One has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire. He has also overcome this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views.\n\nExcellent, good Kacc\u0101na! Excellent, good Kacc\u0101na! Just as if one might set upright what was overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms, in the same way, good Kacc\u0101na, the Dhamma has been explained by you in many ways. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Venerable Kacc\u0101na accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from today onward for life.\"\n\n## 2.38\n\nAt one time, the Venerable Mah\u0101kacc\u0101na was dwelling in Madhur\u0101, in Gunda's Grove.\n\nThen, the brahmin Kandar\u0101yana approached the Venerable Mah\u0101kacc\u0101na and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side. Seated there, the brahmin Kandar\u0101yana said to the Venerable Mah\u0101kacc\u0101na:\n\n\"I have heard it said, good Kacc\u0101na, that 'Kacc\u0101na the recluse does not show respect to aged, elderly, senior, long-standing brahmins by rising up, offering a seat, or greeting them.' Is this true, good Kacc\u0101na? Is it correct that you, Kacc\u0101na, do not show respect to aged, elderly, senior, long-standing brahmins by rising up, offering a seat, or greeting them? This is not proper, good Kacc\u0101na.\"\n\n\"There is, brahmin, a distinction explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, between the status of the elder and the status of the youth. A person may be old, eighty, ninety, or a hundred years of age by birth, but if he indulges in sensual pleasures, lives amidst sensual pleasures, burns with the fever of sensual pleasures, is consumed by sensual thoughts, and is agitated by the search for sensual pleasures, then such a person, though old, is considered immature, not an elder. Conversely, a person may be young, a youth with black hair, blessed with youth and the prime of life. But if he does not indulge in sensual pleasures, does not live amidst sensual pleasures, is not burned by the fever of sensual pleasures, is not consumed by sensual thoughts, and is not agitated by the search for sensual pleasures, then such a person, though young, is considered wise, and is indeed an elder.\"\n\nHaving said this, the brahmin Kandar\u0101yana rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and bowed his head at the feet of the hundred young bhikkhus, saying: \"You are elders, standing on the ground of elders. We are youths, standing on the ground of youths.\"\n\n\"Excellent, good Kacc\u0101na! ... From this day forth, let the Venerable Kacc\u0101na consider me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.\"\n\n## 2.39\n\n\"Bhikkhus, when robbers are strong, kings at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the king is not able to travel or send out forces to the border regions, or to effectively govern the outlying provinces. Likewise, at that time, it is not easy for brahmins and householders to travel, send out forces, or inspect their fields and workers. Similarly, bhikkhus, when bhikkhus who practice wrongly are strong, bhikkhus who practice rightly at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus who practice rightly remain silent and subdued within the Sangha, or they dwell in the outlying regions. This situation is for the harm and misfortune of many, for the suffering and detriment of many persons, gods, and humans.\n\nBhikkhus, when kings are strong, robbers at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the king can travel, send out forces, and effectively govern the border regions. Likewise, at that time, brahmins and householders can travel, send out forces, and inspect their fields and workers with ease. Similarly, bhikkhus, when bhikkhus who practice rightly are strong, bhikkhus who practice wrongly at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus who practice wrongly remain silent and subdued within the Sangha, or they leave. This situation is for the benefit and happiness of many, for the welfare and prosperity of many persons, gods, and humans.\"\n\n## 2.40\n\n\"Bhikkhus, I do not praise two kinds of wrong practice, whether by a householder or a renunciant. A householder or a renunciant who practices wrongly due to wrong practice does not accomplish the proper, skillful Dhamma.\n\nBhikkhus, I praise two kinds of right practice, whether by a householder or a renunciant. A householder or a renunciant who practices rightly due to right practice accomplishes the proper, skillful Dhamma.\"\n\n## 2.41\n\n\"Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who misunderstand the discourses and misinterpret the expressions, and thereby reject the meaning and the Dhamma, these bhikkhus are practicing for the harm of many, for the misfortune, suffering, and harm of many persons, gods, and humans. These bhikkhus generate much demerit, and they cause the true Dhamma to disappear.\n\nBhikkhus, those bhikkhus who well understand the discourses and correctly interpret the expressions, and thereby align with the meaning and the Dhamma, these bhikkhus are practicing for the benefit of many, for the happiness, welfare, and benefit of many persons, gods, and humans. These bhikkhus generate much meritorious action, and they preserve the true Dhamma.\""}

Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones has confidence, is convinced in the enlightenment of the Tath\u0101gata, acknowledging: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant and perfectly awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide for trainable individuals, a teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called the faculty of confidence.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of energy? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for the giving up of unwholesome mental qualities and for the cultivation of wholesome mental qualities. With steadfast determination and unwavering effort, he generates desire, strives, arouses persistence, comprehends with his mind, and makes an effort, both to prevent the arising of unarisen harmful unwholesome mental qualities and to abandon existing ones, and to bring forth and develop unarisen wholesome mental qualities and enhance those that have arisen. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of energy.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of mindfulness? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is fully attentive, equipped with utmost mindfulness, able to recall and reflect upon things done and said long ago. He practices by observing the body in and of itself, ardently, with full awareness and mindfulness, having put away craving and aversion with regard to the world. Similarly, he applies this practice to feelings, mind, and mental qualities, dwelling as an observer who fully understands and remains mindful, eradicating worldly desires and dissatisfaction. This is called the faculty of mindfulness.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of collectedness (sam\u0101dhi)? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones, having made letting go his basis, attains stability of mind, attains unification of mind. Having secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental qualities, he enters and dwells in the first jh\u0101na, which includes reflection and examination (of thoughts), born of seclusion, filled with rapture (joy) and pleasure. With the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, he enters and dwells in the second jh\u0101na, which is devoid of reflection and examination, and has rapture (joy) and pleasure born of a stable mind. With the fading of rapture, he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware, experiencing pleasure with the body, which the noble ones declare, 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful' - he enters and dwells in the third jh\u0101na. With the letting go of pleasure and pain, and the disappearance of previous joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jh\u0101na, characterized by neither pain nor pleasure, which possesses purification of awareness by equanimity. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of collectedness.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is wise, endowed with the wisdom that understands the arising and passing away of phenomena, a wisdom that is noble and penetrative, and leads directly to the cessation of suffering. Such a disciple truly understands, 'This is suffering', 'This is the origin of suffering', 'This is the cessation of suffering', and 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering'. This is called the faculty of wisdom.\n\nThese, bhikkhus, are the five faculties.\""}

Therefore, he is called the Tath\u0101gata.\n\nBhikkhus, as he speaks, so he acts; as he acts, so he speaks. Therefore, one whose words match his actions and whose actions match his words is called the Tath\u0101gata.\n\nBhikkhus, in the world with its deities, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, ascetics, and brahmins, including gods and humans, the Tath\u0101gata is unsurpassed, unconquered, one who sees things as they are, and wielding power.

Thus with a mind that is clarified and unconfined, he develops a radiant mind.\n\nA bhikkhu develops the base of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) accompanied by intentional effort thus: 'My investigation will not be too slack, nor too intense, nor inwardly inhibited, nor outwardly scattered.'

Thus with a mind that is clarified and unconfined, he develops a radiant mind.\n\n### Analysis of Aspiration\n\nBhikkhus, what is an aspiration that is too slack? Bhikkhus, aspiration that is accompanied by laziness and associated with laziness \u2014 this is called aspiration that is too slack.\n\nBhikkhus, what is an aspiration that is too intense? Bhikkhus, aspiration that is accompanied by restlessness and associated with restlessness \u2014 this is called aspiration that is too intense.\n\nBhikkhus, what is an aspiration that is inwardly inhibited? Bhikkhus, aspiration that is accompanied by dullness and drowsiness and associated with dullness and drowsiness \u2014 this is called aspiration that is inwardly inhibited.\n\nBhikkhus, what is an aspiration that is outwardly scattered? Bhikkhus, aspiration that is outwardly scattered due to engagement with the five cords of sensual pleasure \u2014 this is called aspiration that is outwardly scattered.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell continuously aware: 'As before, so after; as after, so before'? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's mindfulness of before and after is well grasped, well attended to, well sustained, and well penetrated by wisdom. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating 'As before, so after; as after, so before.'\n\nBhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating 'As below, so above; as above, so below'? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu contemplates this very body from the soles of the feet upward and from the crown of the head downward, bounded by skin and full of various kinds of impurities: 'In this body there are hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, oil of the joints, and urine.' Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating 'As below, so above; as above, so below.'\n\nBhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating 'As by day, so by night; as by night, so by day'? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the base of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration, accompanied by an intention of continuous effort by day, and also by night, thus: 'My aspiration will not be too slack, nor too intense, nor inwardly inhibited, nor outwardly scattered.' He dwells contemplating 'As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.' Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating 'As by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.'\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop a mind that is clarified, unconfined and radiant? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's perception of brightness is well grasped, and his perception of day is well established. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops a mind that is clarified, unconfined, and radiant.\"\n\n### Analysis of Energy\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is energy that is too slack? Bhikkhus, energy that is accompanied by laziness and associated with laziness \u2014 this is called energy that is too slack.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is energy that is too intense? Bhikkhus, energy that is accompanied by restlessness and associated with restlessness \u2014 this is called effort that is too intense.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is energy that is inwardly inhibited? Bhikkhus, energy that is accompanied by dullness and drowsiness and associated with dullness and drowsiness \u2014 this is called effort that is inwardly inhibited.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is energy that is outwardly scattered? Bhikkhus, energy that is outwardly scattered due to engagement with the five cords of sensual pleasure \u2014 this is called effort that is outwardly scattered (... all as above)\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop a mind that is clarified, unconfined, and radiant? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's perception of brightness is well grasped, and his perception of day is well established. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops a mind that is clarified, unconfined, and radiant.\n\n### Analysis of Mind\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is a mind that is too slack?

Bhikkhus, an investigation that is accompanied by laziness and associated with laziness \u2014 this is called an investigation that is too slack.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is an investigation that is too intense? Bhikkhus, an investigation that is accompanied by restlessness and associated with restlessness \u2014 this is called an investigation that is too intense.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is an investigation that is inwardly inhibited?

Bhikkhus, an investigation that is outwardly scattered due to engagement with the five cords of sensual pleasure \u2014 this is called an investigation that is outwardly scattered (...all as above) Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops a mind that is clarified, unconfined, and radiant. Thus developed and frequently practiced, bhikkhus, the four bases of psychic ability are of great fruit and great benefit.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has developed and frequently practiced the four bases of psychic ability experiences various kinds of psychic abilities: being one, he becomes many; being many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he passes through walls, enclosures, and mountains as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though on solid ground; he flies through the air cross-legged like a bird with wings; he touches and strokes the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; and he controls his body as far as the Brahm\u0101 world. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has developed and frequently practiced the four bases of psychic ability, through the wearing away of the taints, attains and dwells in the taintless release of mind and release by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge in this very life.\""}

What are these five? (1) The state 'do not grow old' when subject to aging is unobtainable by an ascetic, a brahmin, a deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone in the world. (2) The state 'do not fall ill' when subject to illness ... (3) 'do not die' when subject to death ... (4) 'do not perish' when subject to perishing ... (5) 'do not be lost' when subject to loss is unobtainable by an ascetic, a brahmin, a deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone else in the world.\n\n(1) Bhikkhus, for an uninstructed ordinary person, what is subject to aging inevitably ages (grows old). When this occurs, he does not reflect thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to aging ages. For all beings that cycle through coming and going, passing away, and rebirth, what is subject to aging ages. If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to old age grows old, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would not be able to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he grieves, grows weary, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes disoriented. This is called an uninstructed ordinary person pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow, who only torments himself.\n\n(2) Again, for the uninstructed ordinary person, what is subject to illness falls ill \u2026 (3) \u2026 what is subject to death dies \u2026 (4) \u2026 what is subject to perishing perishes \u2026 (5) \u2026 what is subject to loss is lost.

If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to loss is lost, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would not be able to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he grieves, grows weary, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes disoriented. This is called an uninstructed ordinary person pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow, who only torments himself.\n\n(1) Bhikkhus, for a learned disciple of the noble ones, what is subject to aging inevitably ages (grows old). When this occurs, he reflects thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to aging ages. For all beings that cycle through coming and going, passing away, and rebirth, what is subject to aging ages. If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to old age grows old, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would not be able to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he does not grieve, he does not grow weary, does not lament, does not weep beating his breast and does not become disoriented. This is said, bhikkhus: 'A learned disciple of the noble ones who has extracted the poisonous dart of sorrow with which the uninstructed ordinary person pierces and torments himself. He, free from sorrow and without a dart, personally attains complete Nibb\u0101na.'\n\n(2) Furthermore, bhikkhus, for the learned disciple of the noble ones, what is subject to illness becomes ill... (3) what is subject to death dies... (4) what is subject to perishing perishes... (5) what is subject to loss is lost. When this occurs, he reflects thus: 'It is not only I who lose what is subject to loss. Indeed, for all beings that cycle through coming and going, passing away, and rebirth, what is subject to loss is lost by all. If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to loss is lost, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would be unable to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he does not grieve, does not grow weary, does not lament, does not weep beating his breast, and does not become disoriented. This is said, bhikkhus: 'A learned disciple of the noble ones who has removed the poisonous dart of sorrow, with which the uninstructed ordinary person pierces and torments himself. He, free from sorrow and without a dart, personally attains complete Nibb\u0101na.'\n\nThese, bhikkhus, are the five unobtainable states by an ascetic, a brahmin, a deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone else in the world.\"\n\n\"Not by grieving nor lamenting\nis even a little good achieved;\nknowing someone is distressed and grieving,\nenemies become delighted.\n\nWhen the wise one does not waver in adversity,\nskilled in discerning what is good,\ntheir enemies become disheartened\nupon seeing their steadfast, unchanged expression.\n\nThrough chanting, mantras, or well-spoken words,\nthrough giving out or according to tradition;\nwherever and however one might gain one's good,\nthere one should exert oneself accordingly.\n\nIf one realizes that this good\ncannot be achieved by oneself or by anyone else,\none should remain composed,\nthinking: 'Kamma is decisive; what can I do now?'\""}

After approaching, they said to him: \"Is it true, friend Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, that you have had such a harmful view arise: 'I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them?'\"\n\n\"Yes, friends, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.\"\n\nThen those bhikkhus, desiring to separate Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, from this harmful view, cross-questioned, asked for reasons, and advised him thus: \"Friend Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus. For in many ways the Blessed One has stated how obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who practices while engaging in them. The Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by the Blessed One to be like a skeleton ... like a piece of meat ... like a grass torch ... like a pit of burning coals ... like a dream ... like borrowed goods ... like the fruits on a tree ... like the butcher's knife and chopping block ... like swords and spears ... like a snake's head, with much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more.\"\n\nEven so, Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, being cross-questioned, asked for reasons, and advised by those bhikkhus, still stubbornly, holding firmly, and doubling down on that harmful view and said: \"Yes, indeed, friends, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.\"\n\nSince those bhikkhus could not separate Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, from this harmful view, they went to the Blessed One. After approaching, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, a certain bhikkhu named Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, who was formerly a vulture catcher, has had such a harmful view arise: 'I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.' We heard it like this, venerable sir.\n\nThen, venerable sir, we went to Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher; after approaching, we said to Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher: Friend Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, is it true that you have had such a harmful view arise: 'I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them?'\n\nWhen this was said, venerable sir, Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, responded to us: 'Yes, indeed, friends, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.' Then, venerable sir, we, desiring to separate Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, from this harmful view, cross-questioned, asked for reasons, and advised him: 'Do not say so, friend Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus. In many ways, friend Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the Blessed One has declared these things to be obstructions and capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them. The Blessed One has declared that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by the Blessed One to be like a skeleton ... like a piece of meat ... like a grass torch ... like a pit of burning coals ... like a dream ... like borrowed goods ... like the fruits on a tree ... like the butcher's knife and chopping block ... like swords and spears ... like a snake's head, much suffering, much despair, and the danger in them is still more.'\n\nEven so, venerable sir, Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, being cross-questioned, asked for reasons, and advised by us, still stubbornly, holding firmly, and doubling down on that harmful view said: 'Yes, indeed, friends, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.' Since we could not separate Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, from this harmful view, we reported this matter to the Blessed One.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: \"Come, bhikkhu, in my name, call Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher: 'The Teacher calls you, friend Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha.'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" that bhikkhu replied to the Blessed One. After approaching Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, said to him: \"The Teacher calls you, friend Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha.\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, replied to that bhikkhu. After approaching the Blessed One, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One spoke to Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher:\n\n\"Is it true, Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, that you have had such a harmful view arise: 'I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One in such a way that those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them?'\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, venerable sir, I do understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: That those things declared by the Blessed One to be obstructions are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.\"\n\n\"Misguided person, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way? Haven't I declared in many ways that obstructive things are obstructive? And yet, you claim that they are not capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them. Sensual pleasures are declared by me to provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by me to be like a skeleton ... like a piece of meat ... like a grass torch ... like a pit of burning coals ... like a dream ... like borrowed goods ... like the fruits on a tree ... like a butcher's knife and chopping block ... like swords and spears ... like a snake's head, with much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Yet, you, misguided person, with your wrong grasp, misrepresent me, harm yourself, and produce much demerit (unwholesome kamma). This will be for your long-term harm and suffering.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"What do you think, bhikkhus, is this Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, even enthusiastic about this Dhamma and Vinaya?\"\n\n\"How could it be, venerable sir; no, venerable sir.\" When this was said, Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, sat silent, dejected, with shoulders drooping, head down, reflecting, unable to respond.\n\nThen the Blessed One, knowing that Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, was silent, dejected, with shoulders drooping, head down, reflecting, and unable to respond, said to him: \"You will be recognized, misguided person, by this own harmful view of yours. Here, I will question the bhikkhus.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Do you also, bhikkhus, understand the Dhamma taught by me in such a way that this Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, with his own wrong grasp, misrepresents me, harms himself, and produces much demerit?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir. Indeed, in many ways, obstructive things have been declared by the Blessed One to be obstructive; and they are capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them. Sensual pleasures are declared by the Blessed One to provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by the Blessed One to be like a skeleton ... like a snake's head, with much suffering, much despair, and the danger in them is still more.\"\n\n\"Good, good, bhikkhus, it is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way. Indeed, bhikkhus, in many ways, I have declared obstructive things to be obstructive, and they are capable of obstructing one who practices while engaging in them.\n\nSensual pleasures are declared by me to provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and the danger in them is still more. Sensual pleasures are declared by me to be like a skeleton ... like a snake's head, with much suffering, much despair, and the danger in them is still more. Yet, this Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha, the bhikkhu who was formerly a vulture catcher, with his own wrong grasp, misrepresents me, harms himself, and produces much demerit. This will be for his long-term harm and suffering. Bhikkhus, that one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual desires, without perceptions of sensual desire, without thoughts of sensual desire\u2014that is impossible\n\n#### Simile of a Water Snake\n\nHere, bhikkhus, some misguided persons thoroughly learn the Dhamma \u2014 discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts. Having thoroughly learned the Dhamma, they do not investigate the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Not investigating the meaning with wisdom, they do not gain a reflective acceptance of them. They learn the Dhamma only for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. They do not experience the purpose for which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, wrongly grasped, lead to their long-term harm and suffering. What is the reason for this? It is because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a man desiring a water snake, seeking a water snake, searching for a water snake, would see a large water snake. He would grasp it either by its coils or its tail. Then that water snake would turn back and bite his hand, his arm, or some other part of his body. Because of that, he would either die or experience death-like suffering. What is the reason for that? It is because of the wrong grasp of the water snake, bhikkhus.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, some misguided persons thoroughly learn the Dhamma \u2014 discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts. Having thoroughly learned the Dhamma, they do not investigate the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Not investigating the meaning with wisdom, they do not gain a reflective acceptance of them. They learn the Dhamma only for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. They do not experience the purpose for which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, wrongly grasped, lead to their long-term harm and suffering. What is the reason for this? It is because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.\n\nHowever, bhikkhus, some noble sons thoroughly learn the Dhamma \u2014 discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts. Having thoroughly learned the Dhamma, they investigate the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Investigating the meaning with wisdom, they gain a reflective acceptance of them. They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. They experience the purpose for which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, rightly grasped, lead to their long-term welfare and happiness. What is the reason for that? It is because of their right grasp of the teachings, bhikkhus.\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, a man desiring a water snake, seeking a water snake, searching for a water snake, would see a large water snake. He would skillfully grasp it with a cleft stick. Having skillfully grasped it with a cleft stick, he would hold it firmly by the neck. Although that water snake might coil around his hand, his arm, or some other part of his body, he would not die or experience death-like suffering because of that. What is the reason for that? It is because of the right grasp of the water snake, bhikkhus.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, some noble sons thoroughly learn the Dhamma \u2014 discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvelous accounts, and analytical texts. Having thoroughly learned the Dhamma, they investigate the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Investigating the meaning with wisdom, they gain a reflective acceptance of them. They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. They experience the purpose for which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, rightly grasped, lead to their long-term welfare and happiness. What is the reason for that? It is because of their right grasp of the teachings, bhikkhus.\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, if you understand the meaning of what I have spoken, you should retain it accordingly. And if you do not understand the meaning of what I have spoken, you should ask me about it, or those other experienced bhikkhus.\n\n#### Simile of a Raft\n\nI will teach you, bhikkhus, the Dhamma by means of a simile of a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. Listen to it and pay close attention, I will speak.\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Just as, bhikkhus, a man traveling on a long journey would see a great expanse of water, with a near shore that is dangerous and fearful, and a far shore that is safe and free from fear; but there would be no boat or bridge for him to cross to the far shore. It would occur to him: 'This is indeed a great expanse of water, with a near shore that is dangerous and fearful, and a far shore that is safe and free from fear; but there is no boat or bridge to cross to the far shore. What if I were to gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves, tie them together into a raft, and relying on that raft, with hands and feet, strive to safely cross to the far shore?' Then, bhikkhus, that man, having gathered grass, sticks, branches, and leaves, tied them together into a raft, and relying on that raft, with hands and feet, striving, would safely cross to the far shore. For that man, having crossed over and reached the far shore, it would occur to him: 'This raft has been very beneficial to me; relying on this raft, with hands and feet, striving, I have safely crossed to the far shore. What if I were to carry this raft on my head or on my shoulder and go wherever I wish?'\n\nWhat do you think, bhikkhus, would that man be acting properly by doing so with that raft?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And how, bhikkhus, would that man be acting properly with that raft? Here, bhikkhus, for that man, having crossed over and reached the far shore, it would occur to him: 'This raft has been very beneficial to me; relying on this raft, with hands and feet, striving, I have safely crossed to the far shore. What if I were to set this raft on the land or sink it in the water and then go wherever I wish?' By acting thus, bhikkhus, that man would be acting properly with that raft.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, the Dhamma has been taught by me with the simile of a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. When you understand the Dhamma taught by me as similar to a raft, even the teachings should be let go, how much more so that which is contrary to the teachings.\n\n#### Standpoint for Views\n\nThere are these six views, bhikkhus. What are the six? Here, bhikkhus, an uninstructed ordinary person, who has not seen the noble ones, is unskilled in the Dhamma of the noble ones, untrained in the Dhamma of the noble ones, who has not seen the virtuous persons, is unskilled in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, untrained in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, perceives form as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; perceives feeling as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; perceives perception as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; perceives formations as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; and whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought, and pondered by the mind, he perceives it as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'; and he perceives the view: 'This world is the self, after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity,' he perceives it as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.'\n\nBut the learned disciple of the noble ones, bhikkhus, who has seen the noble ones, is skilled in the Dhamma of the noble ones, trained in the Dhamma of the noble ones, who has seen the virtuous persons, is skilled in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, trained in the Dhamma of the virtuous persons, perceives form as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; perceives feeling as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; perceives perception as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; perceives formations as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; and whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought, and pondered by the mind, he perceives it as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self'; and he perceives the view: 'This world is the self, after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity,' he perceives it as 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'\n\nPerceiving thus, he does not get agitated in what is not present.\n\n#### Agitation\n\nWhen this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, could there be agitation about something external that is not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said. \"Here, bhikkhu, it happens to some: 'I had it once, but I no longer have it; I want it, but I cannot obtain it.' They grieve, lament, weep, beat their breast, and become confused. Thus, bhikkhu, there is agitation about something external that is not present.\"\n\n\"But, venerable sir, could there be non-agitation about something external that is not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said. \"Here, bhikkhu, it does not happen to some: 'I had it once, but I no longer have it; I want it, but I cannot obtain it.' They do not grieve, do not lament, do not weep, do not beat their breast, and do not become confused. Thus, bhikkhu, there is non-agitation about something external that is not present.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, could there be agitation about something internal that is not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said. \"Here, bhikkhu, it happens to some: 'This world is the self, I shall be after death, permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity.' They hear a Tath\u0101gata or a disciple of a Tath\u0101gata teaching for the letting go of all standpoints for views, for the pacification of all formations, for the relinquishing of all acquisitions, for the wearing away of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibb\u0101na. It occurs to them: 'I shall be annihilated, I shall be destroyed, I shall not exist anymore.' They grieve, lament, weep, beat their breast, and become confused. Thus, bhikkhus, there is agitation about something internal that is not present.\"\n\n\"But, venerable sir, could there be non-agitation about something internal that in not present?\"\n\n\"There could be, bhikkhus,\" the Blessed One replied. \"Here, bhikkhus, it does not happen to some: 'This world is the self, I shall be after death, permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity.' They hear a Tath\u0101gata or a disciple of a Tath\u0101gata teaching for the letting go of all standpoints for views, for the pacification of all formations, for the relinquishing of all acquisitions, for the wearing away of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibb\u0101na. It does not occur to them: 'I shall be annihilated, I shall be destroyed, I shall not exist anymore.' They do not grieve, do not lament, do not weep, do not beat their breast, and do not become confused. Thus, bhikkhus, there is non-agitation about something internal that is not present.\n\n#### Acquire a Permanent Possession\n\nBhikkhus, you could acquire that possession which is permanent, stable, eternal, of unchanging nature, and will endure as long as eternity. Do you see any possession, bhikkhus, that is permanent, stable, eternal, of unchanging nature, and will endure as long as eternity?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. I, too, do not see any possession, bhikkhus, that is permanent, stable, eternal, of unchanging nature, and will endure as long as eternity.\n\n#### Hold on to a Sorrow Free Self-View\n\nBhikkhus, you could hold on to a self-view, from which, if taken up, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise. Do you see, bhikkhus, any self-view which, if taken up and held on to, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. I, too, do not see any attachment to self-view, bhikkhus, from which, if taken up, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise.\n\nBhikkhus, you should depend on that view which, if depended on, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise. Do you see, bhikkhus, any view as a basis which, if depended on, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. I, too, do not see any view as a basis, bhikkhus, from which, if depended on, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise.\n\nOr, bhikkhus, if there were a self, would it be proper to think 'This belongs to me'?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Or, bhikkhus, if there were something belonging to self, would it be proper to think 'The self belongs to me'?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And, bhikkhus, if the self and what belongs to the self are not found to exist truly and firmly, then this view: 'This world is the self, I shall be after death, permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity,' is entirely and completely misguided, isn't it?\"\n\n\"How could it not be, venerable sir? Indeed, venerable sir, it is entirely and completely foolish.\"\n\n\"What do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\"\n\n\"Suffering, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, bhikkhus, is feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\"\n\n\"Suffering, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?\"\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Any kind of feeling ... any kind of perception ... any kind of formations ... any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'\n\nSeeing thus, bhikkhus, the learned disciple of the noble ones becomes disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with formations, disenchanted with consciousness. Through disenchantment, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there is knowledge: 'Liberated.'\n\nHe understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\n#### The Arahant\n\nBhikkhus, this bhikkhu is called one who has lifted the barrier, one whose vision is unobstructed, one who has pulled out the dart, one without hindrances, a noble one who has lowered the banner, put down the burden, and is completely liberated.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu lift the barrier? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's ignorance is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lifts the barrier.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu have unobstructed vision? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's cycle of rebirths leading to repeated births is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has unobstructed vision.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu pull out the dart? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's craving is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu pulls out the dart.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become without hindrances? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's five lower fetters are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, annihilated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes without hindrances.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a noble one who has lowered the banner, put down the burden, and is completely liberated? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's conceit 'I am' is abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and not subject to future arising. Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a noble one who has lowered the banner, put down the burden, and is completely liberated.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu whose mind is liberated, the gods with Indra, with Brahm\u0101, with Paj\u0101pati, searching for that consciousness of the one thus gone, do not find it. And why is that? I declare, bhikkhus, that the one thus gone is not traceable in the present.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins falsely, baselessly, and wrongly accuse me, saying: 'The recluse Gotama is a proponent of annihilation, he teaches the destruction, the eradication, the non-existence of a being.' Yet, bhikkhus, as I do not say, as I do not declare, those respected recluses and brahmins falsely, baselessly, and wrongly accuse me, saying: 'The recluse Gotama is a proponent of annihilation, he teaches the destruction, the eradication, the non-existence of a being.' Formerly and now, bhikkhus, I declare only suffering and the cessation of suffering. Bhikkhus, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass the Tath\u0101gata, there is no anger, no resentment, and no displeasure in the Tath\u0101gata's mind.\n\nBhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate the Tath\u0101gata, there is no joy, no gladness, and no elation in the Tath\u0101gata's mind. Bhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate the Tath\u0101gata, the Tath\u0101gata thinks: 'This has been previously understood by me; such things happen.'\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass you, you should not harbor anger, resentment, or displeasure in your minds. Therefore, bhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate you, you should not harbor joy, gladness, or elation in your minds. Therefore, bhikkhus, if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate you, you should think: 'This has been previously understood by me; such things happen.'\n\nTherefore, bhikkhus, abandon what is not yours; when you have abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is not yours? Form, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nFeeling, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Perception, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Formations, bhikkhus, are not yours, abandon them; having abandoned them, they will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Consciousness, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nWhat do you think, bhikkhus, if someone were to carry away the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves here in Jeta's Grove, or burn them, or do with them as they wish? Would it occur to you: 'They are carrying us away, burning us, or doing with us as they wish'?\n\n\"Indeed not, venerable sir.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because, venerable sir, it is not self, nor what belongs to self.\"\n\n\"In the same way, bhikkhus, abandon what is not yours; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. And what, bhikkhus, is not yours? Form, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Feeling, bhikkhus ... Perception, bhikkhus ... Formations, bhikkhus ... Consciousness, bhikkhus, is not yours, abandon it; having abandoned it, it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, there are those bhikkhus who are Arahants, with taints destroyed, who have lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, destroyed the fetters of becoming, and are completely liberated through final knowledge; there is no cycle for them to describe.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those bhikkhus who have abandoned the five lower fetters, all of them are spontaneously reborn, there they will attain final Nibb\u0101na, not liable to return from that world.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those bhikkhus who have abandoned the three fetters, with greed, hatred, and delusion attenuated, all of them are once-returners, returning once more to this world, they will make an end of suffering.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those bhikkhus who have abandoned the three fetters, all of them are stream-enterers, not liable to fall into a lower state, fixed in their destiny, bound for full awakening.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, there are those bhikkhus who are followers of the Dhamma and followers of faith, all of them are bound for full awakening.\n\nBhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, for those who have mere faith and love in me, all of them are bound for heaven.\"\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

Listen carefully, pay close attention, I will speak.\"\n\n\"So be it, venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"What, bhikkhus, is dependent co-arising? With birth as condition, bhikkhus, there is aging and death. Whether Tath\u0101gatas arise or not, this property, this stability of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma, this conditionality, remains. The Tath\u0101gata fully understands this and makes it known. Having fully understood, he reveals, teaches, proclaims, establishes, discloses, analyzes, and makes it clear, saying: 'See, bhikkhus, with birth as condition, there is aging and death.'\n\nWith continued existence as condition, there is birth\u2026 with clinging as condition, there is continued existence\u2026 with craving as condition, there is clinging\u2026\n\nwith feeling as condition, there is craving\u2026 with contact as condition, there is feeling\u2026 with the six sense bases as condition, there is contact\u2026 with name-and-form as condition, there are the six sense bases\u2026\n\nwith consciousness as condition, there is name-and-form\u2026\n\nwith volitional formations as condition, there is consciousness\u2026 with ignorance as condition, there are volitional formations. Whether Tath\u0101gatas arise or not, this property, this stability of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma, this conditionality, remains. The Tath\u0101gata fully understands this and makes it known. Having fully understood, he reveals, teaches, proclaims, establishes, discloses, analyzes, and makes it clear, saying: 'See, bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition, there are volitional formations.' Thus, bhikkhus, such is the truth, the unerring, the not otherwise, the conditionality\u2014this is called, bhikkhus, dependent co-arising.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, are the phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising? Aging and death, bhikkhus, are impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. Birth, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. continued existence, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. Clinging, bhikkhus\u2026 craving, bhikkhus\u2026\n\nfeeling, bhikkhus\u2026 contact, bhikkhus\u2026 the six sense bases, bhikkhus\u2026 name-and-form, bhikkhus\u2026\n\nconsciousness, bhikkhus\u2026\n\nvolitional formations, bhikkhus\u2026 ignorance, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, arisen dependently, subject to ending, subject to fading, subject to cessation, subject to relinquishment. These are called, bhikkhus, the phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple sees as they really are with correct wisdom this dependent co-arising and these phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising, then they will not run back into the past, thinking: 'Was I in the past, was I not in the past, what was I in the past, how was I in the past, having been what, what did I become in the past?' nor will they run forward into the future, thinking: 'Will I be in the future, will I not be in the future, what will I be in the future, how will I be in the future, having been what, what will I become in the future?' nor will they now in the present be tormented with doubt thinking: 'Am I, am I not, what am I, how am I, where has this being come from, where will it go?' For such a place does not exist. Why is that? For, bhikkhus, a noble disciple sees this dependent co-arising and these phenomena arisen from dependent co-arising as they really are with correct wisdom.\""}

Then, for seven days, the Blessed One sat in one posture experiencing the bliss of liberation.

That is - with the cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form cease; with the cessation of name-and-form, the six sense bases cease; with the cessation of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases; with the cessation of becoming, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, displeasure, and despair cease.

He spoke thus before the Ves\u0101li assembly:\n\n\"The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones. The ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition. And the Dhamma he teaches for the purpose indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering (stress/tension/discontentment).\"\n\nThen, when it was early morning, the venerable S\u0101riputta, having put on robe, and taking his bowl, entered Ves\u0101li for alms. The venerable S\u0101riputta heard Sunakkhatta, the son of the Licchavis, making this statement before the Ves\u0101li assembly: \"The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones. The ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition. And the Dhamma he teaches for the purpose indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering.\"\n\nThen, the venerable S\u0101riputta, having wandered for alms in Ves\u0101li and having returned from the alms-round after the meal, approached the Blessed One. Having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the venerable S\u0101riputta said this to the Blessed One: \"Sunakkhatta, venerable sir, the son of the Licchavis, has recently departed from this Dhamma and discipline. He speaks thus in the assembly at Ves\u0101li: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones. The ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition. And the Dhamma he teaches for the purpose indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering.'\"\n\n\"S\u0101riputta, the misguided person Sunakkhatta is angry. And this statement was spoken out of anger. Intending to disparage, S\u0101riputta, Sunakkhatta, the misguided person, actually speaks praise of the Tath\u0101gata. For, S\u0101riputta, it is praise of the Tath\u0101gata for one to say: 'The Dhamma he teaches indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering.'\n\nIt is possible, S\u0101riputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One, the worthy one, the perfectly awakened one, accomplished in wisdom and moral conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be trained, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.'\n\nIt is possible, S\u0101riputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One who experiences various types of supernormal powers \u2014 becoming one, he becomes many; becoming many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he goes unhindered through walls, enclosures, and mountains as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if in water; he walks on water without breaking the surface as if on land; he flies cross-legged through the sky like a bird; he touches and strokes the moon and sun, mighty and powerful; he even reaches the Brahm\u0101 world with his body.'\n\nIt is possible, S\u0101riputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One who, with his purified divine ear element surpassing that of humans, hears both kinds of sounds, divine and human, whether far or near.'\n\nIt is possible, S\u0101riputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One who comprehends with his own mind the minds of other beings, other individuals. He knows a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; he knows a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; he knows a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; he knows a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; he knows an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; he knows a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; he knows a collected mind as collected and an uncollected mind as uncollected; he knows a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.'\n\n### The Ten Tath\u0101gata Powers\n\nS\u0101riputta, there are these ten Tath\u0101gata powers endowed with which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion. Which ten?\n\nHere, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata knows, as it actually is, the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata knows the outcomes of actions performed in the past, future, and present according to their causes and conditions, as they actually are. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata knows the path leading to all destinations as it actually is. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata knows the world with multiple diverse elements as they actually are. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata knows the various inclinations of beings as they actually are. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata knows the different faculties of other beings and individuals as they actually are. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata knows the defilement, purification, and emergence of jh\u0101nas, liberations, and sam\u0101dhi attainments as they actually are. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata recollects his manifold past lives in detail, such as one birth, two births, and so forth, up to hundreds of thousands of births, including names, clans, appearances, experiences, and locations. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata sees beings passing away and arising, with his divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision. He knows beings as lowly or exalted, beautiful or ugly, fortunate or unfortunate, according to their actions. He knows those who are engaged in bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct, who disparage the noble ones and hold wrong views, and their resulting fate in unfortunate realms. He also knows those who are engaged in bodily, verbal, and mental good conduct, who do not disparage the noble ones and hold right views, and their resulting fate in fortunate realms. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata dwells having personally realized with direct knowledge the wearing away of the taints, experiencing the liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, in the visible state. This too is a Tath\u0101gata power, by which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nS\u0101riputta, these are the ten Tath\u0101gata powers endowed with which the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nS\u0101riputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, S\u0101riputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, S\u0101riputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Four Confidences\n\nS\u0101riputta, these are the four confidences possessed by the Tath\u0101gata. With these confidences, the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion. What are these four?\n\nIf someone were to claim that the realizations of the perfectly self-awakened one are not fully complete, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, S\u0101riputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nIf someone were to claim that the taints are not fully eradicated in one whose taints are fully eradicated, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, S\u0101riputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nIf someone were to claim that the things described as obstructive are not sufficient to cause obstruction when followed, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, S\u0101riputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nIf someone were to claim that the Dhamma taught does not lead to the cessation of suffering for one who practices rightly, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, S\u0101riputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nThese, S\u0101riputta, are the four confidences of the Tath\u0101gata. Endowed with these confidences, the Tath\u0101gata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nS\u0101riputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, S\u0101riputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, S\u0101riputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Eight Assemblies\n\nThere are eight assemblies, S\u0101riputta. Which eight? The assembly of nobles, the assembly of brahmins, the assembly of householders, the assembly of ascetics, the assembly of the Four Great Kings, the assembly of the Thirty-Three Gods, the assembly of M\u0101ra, and the assembly of Brahm\u0101 \u2014 these, S\u0101riputta, are the eight assemblies. Endowed with these four confidences, the Tath\u0101gata approaches and engages with these eight assemblies. I know, S\u0101riputta, that I have approached many hundreds of assemblies of nobles. There too, I have previously sat, conversed, and engaged in discussion. I do not see any indication, S\u0101riputta, that fear or timidity would descend upon me there. Not seeing this possibility, S\u0101riputta, I dwell having attained security, fearlessness, and confidence.\n\nI know, S\u0101riputta, that I have approached many hundreds of assemblies of brahmins, householders, ascetics, the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-Three Gods, M\u0101ra, and Brahm\u0101. There too, I have previously sat, conversed, and engaged in discussion. I do not see any indication, S\u0101riputta, that fear or timidity would descend upon me there. Not seeing this possibility, S\u0101riputta, I dwell having attained security, fearlessness, and confidence.\n\nS\u0101riputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.

Which four? Egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, and spontaneously-born.\n\nAnd which, S\u0101riputta, is the egg-born birth? Those beings, S\u0101riputta, who are born breaking through an egg-shell \u2014 this, S\u0101riputta, is called the egg-born birth. And which, S\u0101riputta, is the womb-born birth? Those beings, S\u0101riputta, who are born breaking through a membrane \u2014 this, S\u0101riputta, is called the womb-born birth. And which, S\u0101riputta, is the moisture-born birth? Those beings, S\u0101riputta, who are born in putrid fish, or in a putrid corpse, or in putrid bean soup, or in a box, or in a cesspool \u2014 this, S\u0101riputta, is called the moisture-born birth. And which, S\u0101riputta, is the spontaneously-born birth? Gods, hell beings, some humans, and some beings in the lower realms \u2014 this, S\u0101riputta, is called the spontaneously-born birth. These, S\u0101riputta, are the four types of birth.\n\nS\u0101riputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, S\u0101riputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, S\u0101riputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Five Destinations and Nibb\u0101na\n\nThere are five future destinations, S\u0101riputta. Which five? Hell, the animal realm, the realm of ghosts, human beings, and gods.\n\nI know hell, S\u0101riputta, and the path to hell, and the practice that leads to hell; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in a state of loss, a bad destination, a plane of misery, in hell \u2014 I know that too. I know the animal realm, S\u0101riputta, and the path to the animal realm, and the practice that leads to the animal realm; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in the animal realm \u2014 I know that too. I know the realm of ghosts, S\u0101riputta, and the path to the realm of ghosts, and the practice that leads to the realm of ghosts; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in the realm of ghosts \u2014 I know that too. I know human beings, S\u0101riputta, and the path to the human world, and the practice that leads to the human world; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises among humans \u2014 I know that too. I know the gods, S\u0101riputta, and the path to the world of gods, and the practice that leads to the world of gods; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in a good destination, a heavenly world \u2014 I know that too. I know Nibb\u0101na, S\u0101riputta, and the path to Nibb\u0101na, and the practice that leads to Nibb\u0101na; and how someone who practices that way, with the wearing away of the taints, attains in this very life the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge \u2014 I know that too.\n\nHere, S\u0101riputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 thus, this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful feelings (sensations). Just as, S\u0101riputta, there is a pit of burning embers, more than a man's height, full of embers without flames, without smoke. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very pit of embers.' At another time, the discerning person would see him fallen into that pit of embers, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful feelings (sensations).\n\nLikewise, S\u0101riputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations.\n\nFurthermore, here, S\u0101riputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the animal realm. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the animal realm, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations. Just as, S\u0101riputta, there is a cesspool greater than a man's height, full of excrement. Then, a person would come, scorched by heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very cesspool.' At another time, the discerning person would see him fallen into that cesspool, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations.\n\nIn the same way, S\u0101riputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the animal realm. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the animal realm, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations.\n\nFurthermore, S\u0101riputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the realm of ghosts. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the realm of ghosts, experiencing predominantly painful sensations. Just as, S\u0101riputta, there is a tree growing on uneven ground, with thin leaves and scanty shade. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very tree.' At another time, the discerning person would see him sitting or lying down in the shade of that tree, experiencing predominantly painful sensations.\n\nIn the same way, S\u0101riputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the realm of ghosts. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the realm of ghosts, experiencing predominantly painful sensations.\n\nHere, S\u0101riputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn among humans. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, among humans, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. Just as, S\u0101riputta, there is a tree growing on even ground, with thick leaves and ample shade. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very tree.' At another time, the discerning person would see him sitting or lying down in the shade of that tree, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nIn the same way, S\u0101riputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn among humans. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, among humans, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nHere, S\u0101riputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind - 'This person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a good destination, in a heavenly world, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. Just as, S\u0101riputta, there is a mansion, with a storied pavilion, plastered and painted, sheltered from the wind, with a fitted door and closed windows. Inside, there is a couch, spread with rugs, coverlets, and blankets, covered with a fine spread of kadali deer skins, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. Then, a person would come, scorched by heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very mansion.' At another time, the discerning person would see him having entered that mansion, lying or sitting on that couch, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nIn the same way, S\u0101riputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a good destination, in a heavenly world, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nHere, S\u0101riputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind \u2014 this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the wearing away of the taints, he will attain the undefiled liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge, in this visible state. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, having realized the wearing away of the taints, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. Just as, S\u0101riputta, there is a pond with clear, cool, cold water, white and well-situated, delightful. Nearby is a dense grove. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very pond.' At another time, the discerning person would see him having entered that pond, bathed, and drunk, having calmed all his heat and exhaustion, sitting or lying down in that grove, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nIn the same way, S\u0101riputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind - 'This person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the wearing away of the taints, he will attain the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge, in this visible state.' I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, having realized the wearing away of the taints, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. These, S\u0101riputta, are the five destinations.\n\nS\u0101riputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, S\u0101riputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, S\u0101riputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Bodhisatta's Ascetic Practices\n\nI know for myself, S\u0101riputta, the spiritual life I practiced, endowed with the four factors \u2014 I was indeed an ascetic, supremely ascetic, I was indeed coarse, extremely coarse, I was indeed scrupulous in morality, most scrupulous, I was indeed secluded, supremely secluded.\n\nThus, S\u0101riputta, in my asceticism \u2014 I was naked, free from social conventions, scratching with hands, not coming near or standing near the honorable ones; I did not accept food not offered, specially prepared, or offered by invitation. I did not accept food from the mouth of a jar, from the mouth of a pot, from inside a doorway, near a stick, near a club, while two others were eating, from a pregnant woman, from a breastfeeding woman, from a woman among men, in food distribution, where it is served, or where flies swarmed. I did not eat fish or meat, or drink alcohol or fermented drink, or drink water with husks. I would eat in one house, two houses... up to seven houses; I would live on one mouthful of food, two mouthfuls... up to seven mouthfuls; I would sustain myself on one gift, two gifts... up to seven gifts; I would eat food for one day, two days... up to seven days; thus, I was devoted to the practice of eating meals at intervals, sometimes even fortnightly.\n\nI would eat raw greens, wild millet, wild red rice, rice brans, water plants, rice husk powder, rice water, ground sesame, grass, cow dung. I would sustain myself on roots and fruits of the forest, eating fallen fruits.\n\nI wore coarse grass mats, burial cloths, shrouds, rag-robes, bark, hides, cloaks of skin, garments of kusa grass, garments of bark, garments of wood bark, hair blankets, animal hair blankets, and owl feathers. I practiced plucking out my hair and beard, standing on one foot, refusing to sit down, squatting, sleeping on a bed of thorns, and immersing myself in water every third evening. Thus, I engaged in various practices of self-mortification and bodily torment. This, S\u0101riputta, was my asceticism.\n\nThus, S\u0101riputta, in my coarseness, a layer of dust accumulated on my body over many years, forming a crust. Just as, S\u0101riputta, a log of the tinduka tree (ebony tree) accumulates dust and forms a crust over many years, similarly, S\u0101riputta, a layer of dust accumulated on my body over many years, forming a crust. It did not occur to me, S\u0101riputta, to wipe this dust off with my hand, nor did I think that others should wipe it off for me. This, S\u0101riputta, was my coarseness.\n\nThus, S\u0101riputta, in my scrupulousness, I would walk forward mindfully and walk back mindfully. Even with a drop of water, compassion would arise in me: 'May I not cause harm to even a small creature placed unevenly.' Thus, S\u0101riputta, this was my scrupulousness.\n\nThus, S\u0101riputta, in my seclusion, I would enter a certain forest dwelling and reside there. Whenever I saw a cowherd, a shepherd, a grass collector, a wood gatherer, or a forest worker, I would move from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from lowland to lowland, and from highland to highland. Why is that? So that they would not see me and I would not see them. Just as, S\u0101riputta, a forest-dwelling deer, upon seeing people, moves from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from lowland to lowland, and from highland to highland; similarly, S\u0101riputta, whenever I saw a cowherd, a shepherd, a grass collector, a wood gatherer, or a forest worker, I would move from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from lowland to lowland, and from highland to highland. Why is that? So that they would not see me and I would not see them. This, S\u0101riputta, was my seclusion.\n\nThus, S\u0101riputta, where there were pens with settled cows and no cowherds present, I would approach with a small bowl and collect the cow dung from calves, young ones, and milking cows. As long as my own urine and dung were not exhausted, I would consume only my own urine and dung. This, S\u0101riputta, was my practice of eating coarse food.\n\nThus, S\u0101riputta, I would dwell in a certain terrifying forest grove. In that terrifying forest grove, anyone who is not free from passion would mostly have their hair stand on end. During the cold winter nights, in-between seasons, and times of snowfall, I would dwell in the open at night and in the forest grove during the day. In the last month of summer, I would stay in the open during the day and in the forest grove at night. Moreover, S\u0101riputta, this extraordinary verse, never heard before, occurred to me:\n\n'Emaciated and dried up,\nalone in the terrifying forest;\nNaked, not sitting by a fire,\nthe sage devoted to seeking.'\n\nThus, S\u0101riputta, I would make my bed in a charnel ground using corpses as a pillow. Furthermore, S\u0101riputta, village boys would approach and spit upon me, urinate upon me, sprinkle me with dust, and insert sticks into my ears. However, S\u0101riputta, I do not recall generating any wicked thoughts towards them. Thus, S\u0101riputta, this was my dwelling in equanimity.\n\nThere are, S\u0101riputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold the view and say: 'Purification is achieved by food.' They say: 'We sustain ourselves on jujube fruits.' They eat jujube fruits, jujube powder, and drink jujube water \u2014 consuming various kinds of jujube preparations. I, S\u0101riputta, have personally experienced living on a single jujube fruit as food. One might think: 'At that time, the jujube fruit must have been large.' But this is not the case, S\u0101riputta. Even then, the jujube fruit was the same size as it is now. Due to eating only a single jujube fruit, my body became extremely emaciated. My limbs and body parts became like the dried, worn-out branches of an old tree. My buttocks stuck out like a post, and my ribs jutted out like the rafters of an old shed. My eyes sank deep into their sockets, like the shimmer of water in a deep well. The skin of my head shriveled and cracked like a bitter gourd plucked when unripe and dried by the wind and sun. When I tried to touch the skin of my belly, I would grasp my backbone. When I tried to touch my backbone, I would grasp the skin of my belly. My belly skin stuck to my backbone due to lack of food. When I needed to defecate or urinate, I would just collapse right there due to weakness. While trying to comfort my body by massaging my limbs with my hands, the hair would fall from my body due to lack of nourishment.\n\nThere are, S\u0101riputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold the view and say: 'Purification is achieved by food.' They say: 'We sustain ourselves on mung beans, on sesame seeds, on rice grains.' They eat rice grains, rice flour, and drink rice water \u2014 consuming rice in various forms. I, S\u0101riputta, have personally experienced living on a single rice grain as food. One might think: 'At that time, the rice grain must have been large.' But this is not the case, S\u0101riputta. Even then, the rice grain was the same size as it is now. Due to eating only a single rice grain, my body became extremely emaciated. My limbs and body parts became like the dried, worn-out branches of an old tree. My buttocks stuck out like a post, and my ribs jutted out like the rafters of an old shed. My eyes sank deep into their sockets, like the shimmer of water in a deep well. The skin of my head shriveled and cracked like a bitter gourd plucked when unripe and dried by the wind and sun. When I tried to touch the skin of my belly, I would grasp my backbone. When I tried to touch my backbone, I would grasp the skin of my belly. My belly skin stuck to my backbone due to lack of food. When I needed to defecate or urinate, I would just collapse right there due to weakness. While trying to comfort my body by massaging my limbs with my hands, the hairs would fall from my body due to lack of nourishment.\n\nEven with that conduct, that practice, those austerities, I did not attain higher human states or the noble wisdom and vision of excellence. Why is that? Because I did not attain the noble wisdom, the noble wisdom which, when attained, leads the doer rightly to the ending of suffering.\n\nThere are, S\u0101riputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through passing from one state of existence to another.' However, in the cycle of rebirths, S\u0101riputta, it is not easy to find a realm that I have not already passed through in this long journey, except among the gods of the Pure Abodes. And if I were to pass on to be born among the gods in the Pure Abodes, S\u0101riputta, I would not return again to this world.\n\nThere are, S\u0101riputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through some particular kind of rebirth.' However, it is not easy to find a kind of rebirth that I have not already undergone in this long journey, except among the gods of the Pure Abodes. And if I were to be reborn among the gods in the Pure Abodes, S\u0101riputta, I would not return again to this world.\n\nThere are, S\u0101riputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through some particular abode.' However, it is not easy to find an abode that I have not already dwelled in during this long journey, except among the gods of the Pure Abodes. And if I were to dwell among the gods in the Pure Abodes, S\u0101riputta, I would not return again to this world.\n\nThere are, S\u0101riputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through sacrifices.' However, it is not easy to find a sacrifice that I have not already performed in this long journey, S\u0101riputta, especially one conducted by a king, a noble warrior chieftain, or a wealthy brahmin.\n\nThere are, S\u0101riputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through worshipping fire.' However, it is not easy to find a fire worship that I have not already practiced in this long journey, S\u0101riputta, especially one conducted by a king, a noble warrior chieftain, or a wealthy brahmin.\n\nS\u0101riputta, there are certain ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'As long as a person is young, youthful, with black hair, endowed with the blessings of youth, and in the prime of life, he is endowed with the highest lucidity of wisdom. But when this person becomes old, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, he declines from that lucidity of wisdom.' But it should not be seen like this, S\u0101riputta. I, S\u0101riputta, am now old, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, being eighty years old. Here, S\u0101riputta, I have four disciples who live for a hundred years, endowed with the highest mindfulness, retention, persistence, and lucidity of wisdom. Just as, S\u0101riputta, a strong archer, trained, practiced, experienced, with little difficulty could shoot an arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, so too, with such highest mindfulness, retention, persistence, and lucidity of wisdom, they might repeatedly ask me questions about the four foundations of mindfulness. Each time they asked, I would answer, and having answered, they would remember my answers and would not ask again about what had been answered. Except when eating, drinking, chewing, or savoring food, performing bodily functions, or resting to dispel fatigue, the Tath\u0101gata's teaching of the Dhamma would remain uninterrupted, as would the Tath\u0101gata's speech on the Dhamma and responses to questions. Even if these four disciples, who live for a hundred years, were to attend to me on a stretcher after a hundred years pass, there would be no change in the lucidity of the Tath\u0101gata's wisdom.\n\nTherefore, S\u0101riputta, when one speaks rightly, one should say: 'A being who is free from delusion has arisen in the world for the benefit and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, benefit, and happiness of gods and humans.' This is how one should speak, S\u0101riputta.\n\nAt that time, the Venerable N\u0101gasam\u0101la was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him. Then the Venerable N\u0101gasam\u0101la said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! As I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma, the hairs of my body stood up. Venerable sir, what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma?\"\n\n\"As to that, N\u0101gasam\u0101la, you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as 'The hair raising discourse.'\"\n\nThus the Blessed One spoke. The Venerable N\u0101gasam\u0101la was satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"This is the only way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of suffering and discontentment, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of Nibb\u0101na, namely the four establishments of mindfulness.\n\nWhat are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed (lust, desire, attachment) and dissatisfaction (aversion, ill-will, resentment) for the world; he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed and dissatisfaction for the world; he dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed and dissatisfaction for the world; he dwells contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away greed and dissatisfaction for the world.\n\nSummary completed.\n\n### 1. Contemplation of the Body\n\n#### 1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing\nHow, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him. Mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.\n\nBreathing in long, he knows, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he knows, 'I breathe out long';\n\nbreathing in short, he knows, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he knows, 'I breathe out short'.\n\nHe trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'.\n\nHe trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation'.\n\nJust as a skilled turner (carpenter) or his apprentice, when making a long turn knows, 'I make a long turn', or making a short turn knows, 'I make a short turn'; so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu knows, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he knows, 'I breathe out long'; breathing in short, he knows, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he knows, 'I breathe out short'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation'.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Mindfulness of Breathing is completed.\n\n#### 1.2. Contemplation of the Body in Postures\nAgain, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu knows, 'I am walking'; when standing, he knows, 'I am standing'; when sitting, he knows, 'I am sitting'; when lying down, he knows, 'I am lying down'; or however his body is disposed, he knows it.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Postures is completed.\n\n#### 1.3. Contemplation of the Body in full awareness\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with full awareness when going forward and returning; who acts with full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts with full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts with full awareness in wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts with full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts with full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts with full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on full awareness is completed.\n\n#### 1.4. Contemplation of the Body in the Asubha Practice (Reflection on repulsiveness)\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the top of the hair down, bounded by skin and full of various impurities: 'In this body, there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, contents of the stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, oil of the joints, and urine.'\n\nJust as if, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain, such as rice, barley, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyesight having opened it were to reflect, 'These are rice, these are barley, these are beans, these are peas, these are millet, these are white rice.'\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the top of the head down, surrounded by skin and filled with various kinds of impurity: 'In this body, there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach contents, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, snot, synovial fluid, urine.'\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Asubha Practice is completed.\n\n#### 1.5. Contemplation of the Body in Reflection on the Elements\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: 'In this body, there are the earth element, water element, fire element, and air element.'\n\nJust as if, bhikkhus, a skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice, having killed a cow, were to sit at a crossroads with it cut up into pieces.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body, as it stands, as it is laid down, according to elements: 'In this body, there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element.'\n\nThus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing phenomena in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing phenomena in the body. 'There is a body,' thus mindfulness is established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nThe section on Reflection on the Elements is completed.\n\n#### 1.6. Contemplation of the Body in the Cemetery Contemplations\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery one, two, or three days dead, bloated, discolored, and decomposing. He applies this perception to his own body: 'This body too is of the same nature; it will become like that; it is not exempt from that fate.' Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery being eaten by crows, dogs, vultures, or various kinds of creatures. He applies this perception to his own body: 'This very body is of the same nature, it will become like that, it is not beyond that.' Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally...\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.\n\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews... a skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews... a fleshless skeleton, held together with sinews... bones scattered in all directions, here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a hip bone, there a backbone, here a rib bone, there a breast bone, here an arm bone, there a shoulder bone, here a neck bone, there a jaw bone, here a tooth, there a skull.

He applies this perception to his own body: 'This very body is of the same nature, it will become like that, it is not beyond that.'\n\nThus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally; contemplating the arising phenomena in the body, or contemplating the vanishing phenomena in the body, or contemplating both the arising and vanishing phenomena in the body. 'There is a body,' thus mindfulness is established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.

Contemplation of Feelings\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating feelings in feelings?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, when feeling a pleasant feeling, a bhikkhu knows, 'I feel a pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a painful feeling, he knows, 'I feel a painful feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a worldly pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel a worldly pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling an unworldly (interior) pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel an unworldly pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a worldly painful feeling, he knows, 'I feel a worldly painful feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling an unworldly painful feeling, he knows, 'I feel an unworldly painful feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel a worldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nWhen feeling an unworldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he knows, 'I feel an unworldly neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating feelings internally, or he dwells contemplating feelings externally, or he dwells contemplating feelings both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in feelings, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing phenomena in feelings, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing phenomena in feelings. 'There is a feeling,' thus mindfulness is established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating feelings in feelings.\n\nThe section on Contemplation of Feelings is completed.\n\n### 3. Contemplation of Mind\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mind in mind?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows a mind with passion as 'a mind with passion'; knows a mind without passion as 'a mind without passion'; knows a mind with aversion as 'a mind with aversion'; knows a mind without aversion as 'a mind without aversion'; knows a mind with delusion as 'a mind with delusion'; knows a mind without delusion as 'a mind without delusion'; knows a contracted mind as 'a contracted mind'; knows a distracted mind as 'a distracted mind'; knows an exalted mind as 'an exalted mind'; knows an unexalted mind as 'an unexalted mind'; knows a surpassed mind as 'a surpassed mind'; knows an unsurpassed mind as 'an unsurpassed mind'; knows a concentrated mind as 'a concentrated mind'; knows an unconcentrated mind as 'an unconcentrated mind'; knows a liberated mind as 'a liberated mind'; knows an unliberated mind as 'an unliberated mind'.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating mind internally, or he dwells contemplating mind externally, or he dwells contemplating mind both internally and externally.

The awareness 'There is a mind' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.

Contemplation of Mental Qualities\n\n#### 4.1. Contemplation of Mental Qualities in the Hindrances\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities with regard to the five hindrances. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five hindrances?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows when there is sensual desire present in him, 'There is sensual desire in me,' or when there is no sensual desire present, 'There is no sensual desire in me,' and he knows how unarisen sensual desire can arise, how arisen sensual desire can be removed, and how a removed sensual desire does not arise again in the future.\n\nHe knows when there is ill-will present in him, 'There is ill-will in me,' or when there is no ill-will present, 'There is no ill-will in me,' and he knows how unarisen ill-will can arise, how arisen ill-will can be removed, and how a removed ill-will does not arise again in the future.\n\nHe knows when there is dullness (complacency) present in him, 'There is dullness in me,' or when there is no dullness present, 'There is no dullness in me,' and he knows how unarisen dullness can arise, how arisen dullness can be removed, and how a removed dullness does not arise again in the future.\n\nHe knows when there is restlessness and remorse present in him, 'There is restlessness and remorse in me,' or when there is no restlessness and remorse present, 'There is no restlessness and remorse in me,' and he knows how unarisen restlessness and remorse can arise, how arisen restlessness and remorse can be removed, and how a removed restlessness and remorse does not arise again in the future.\n \nHe knows when there is doubt present in him, 'There is doubt in me,' or when there is no doubt present, 'There is no doubt in me,' and he knows how unarisen doubt can arise, how arisen doubt can be removed, and how a removed doubt does not arise again in the future.\n \nThus, he dwells contemplating internally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating externally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating both internally and externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in a mental quality.

Contemplation of Mental Qualities in the Aggregates\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities with regard to the five aggregates of clinging (grasping/holding on). And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in and of themselves with regard to the five aggregates of clinging? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu contemplates: 'Such is form, such is the arising of form, such is the cessation of form; such is feeling, such is the arising of feeling, such is the cessation of feeling; such is perception, such is the arising of perception, such is the cessation of perception; such are formations, such is the arising of formations, such is the cessation of formations; such is consciousness, such is the arising of consciousness, such is the cessation of consciousness';\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating internally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating externally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating both internally and externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in a mental quality.

Contemplation of Mental Qualities in the Sense-Bases\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities in the six internal and external sense bases. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in and of themselves in the six internal and external sense bases?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the eye and forms, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he knows how the unarisen fetter can arise, and how the arisen fetter can be abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter will not arise in the future.\n\nHe knows the ear and sounds, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he knows how the unarisen fetter can arise, and how the arisen fetter can be abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter will not arise in the future.\n\nHe knows the nose and odors, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he knows how the unarisen fetter can arise, and how the arisen fetter can be abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter will not arise in the future.\n\nHe knows the tongue and flavors, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he knows how the unarisen fetter can arise, and how the arisen fetter can be abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter will not arise in the future.\n\nHe knows the body and tactile sensations, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he knows how the unarisen fetter can arise, and how the arisen fetter can be abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter will not arise in the future.\n\nHe knows the mind and mental experiences, and the fetter that arises dependent on both; he knows how the unarisen fetter can arise, and how the arisen fetter can be abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter will not arise in the future.\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating internally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating externally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating both internally and externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in a mental quality.

Contemplation of Mental Qualities on the Factors of Awakening\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities in the seven factors of awakening. And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in and of themselves in the seven factors of awakening?\n\nHere, bhikkhus, whether there is the mindfulness awakening factor present internally, a bhikkhu knows, 'I have the mindfulness awakening factor in me,' or if there is no mindfulness awakening factor present, he knows, 'I do not have the mindfulness awakening factor in me,' and he knows how the unarisen mindfulness awakening factor can arise, and how the arisen mindfulness awakening factor can be developed and fulfilled.\n\nWhether there is the investigation of phenomena awakening factor present internally, a bhikkhu knows, 'I have the investigation of phenomena awakening factor in me,' or if there is no investigation of phenomena awakening factor present, he knows, 'I do not have the investigation of phenomena awakening factor in me,' and he knows how the unarisen investigation of phenomena awakening factor can arise, and how the arisen investigation of phenomena awakening factor can be developed and fulfilled.

He dwells contemplating the arising factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in a mental quality. The awareness 'There are mental qualities' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.

Contemplation of Mental Qualities in the Four Noble Truths\nAgain, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities in the Four Noble Truths.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities in the Four Noble Truths? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows as it really is, 'This is suffering (discontentment, stress),' he knows as it really is, 'This is the origin of suffering,' he knows as it really is, 'This is the cessation of suffering,' and he knows as it really is, 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'\n\nThus, he dwells contemplating internally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating externally on mental qualities in and of themselves, or he dwells contemplating both internally and externally on mental qualities in and of themselves. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in a mental quality, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in a mental quality.

He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.\n\nThus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating mental qualities in mental qualities in the Four Noble Truths.\n\nThe section on the Contemplation of Mental Qualities in the Four Noble Truths is completed.\n\n\"Indeed, bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-returner status.\n\nLet alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six years... five years... four years... three years... two years... one year... Let alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for seven months, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-returner status. Let alone seven months, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for six months... five months... four months... three months... two months... one month... half a month... Let alone half a month, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four establishments of mindfulness in such a way for one week, one of two fruits can be expected: either final knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-returner status.\"\n\n\"This is the only way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of suffering and discontentment, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of Nibb\u0101na, namely the four establishments of mindfulness.\" Thus what was said, was said in relation to this.\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}

The venerable S\u0101riputta said this:\n\n\"Friends, there are these five ways a bhikkhu should use to completely remove resentment when it has arisen. What are the five?\n\nHere, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, but whose conduct by speech is pure, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by speech is impure, but whose conduct by body is pure, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is also impure, but who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is also impure, and who does not gain an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nAgain, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is pure, and whose conduct by speech is pure, and who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, resentment should be removed for that kind of person.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, but whose conduct by speech is pure, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a bhikkhu who wears rag-robes, seeing a rag on the roadside, would pick it up with his left foot, spread it out with his right foot, and taking what is usable, leave. In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, but whose conduct by speech is pure, one should not focus on their impure bodily conduct at that time, but should focus on their pure conduct by speech. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by speech is impure, but whose conduct by body is pure, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a lotus pond covered with moss. Then a person comes along, scorched and exhausted by the heat, thirsty and parched. He would plunge into the pond, part the moss with both hands, and drink the water with his cupped hands, then leave. In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by speech is impure, but whose conduct by body is pure, one should not focus on their impure conduct by speech at that time, but should focus on their pure conduct by body. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure and whose conduct by speech is impure, but who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, there was a small amount of water in a cow's footprint. Then a person comes along, scorched and exhausted by the heat, thirsty and parched. He might think: 'If I drink this water with my hands or a cup, I will stir it up and make it undrinkable. Let me get down on all fours and drink it like a cow.' So he gets down on all fours, drinks the water, and leaves. In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is impure, but who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, one should not focus on their impure bodily conduct, nor on their impure conduct by speech at that time. Instead, one should focus on the mental clarity they gain from time to time. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed.\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure and whose conduct by speech is impure, and who does not gain an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a person who is ill, suffering, and gravely sick is traveling along a road. Ahead of him is a village, and behind him is another village, both far away. He does not obtain suitable food, suitable medicine, a suitable attendant, or a suitable guide. Then another person, traveling along the road, would see him and feel compassion, sympathy, and a sense of care, thinking, 'Oh, may this person obtain suitable food, suitable medicine, a suitable attendant, and a suitable guide. Why? So that this person may not come to ruin and disaster right here.' In the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is impure, and whose conduct by speech is impure, and who does not gain an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, one should feel compassion, sympathy, and a sense of care for such a person, thinking, 'Oh, may this venerable one abandon impure conduct by body and develop pure conduct by body, abandon impure conduct by speech and develop pure conduct by speech, abandon impure conduct by mind and develop pure conduct by mind. Why? So that this venerable one, with the breaking up of the body after death, may not be reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.'\n\nFriends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is pure and whose conduct by speech is pure, and who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, how should resentment be removed for that kind of person? Suppose, friends, a clear, sweet, cool, and clean pond, well-established, lovely, and covered with various trees. Then a person comes along, scorched and exhausted by the heat, thirsty and parched. He would plunge into the pond, bathe, drink, and after coming out, would sit or lie down in the shade of the trees.\n\nIn the same way, friends, in the case of a person whose conduct by body is pure, and whose conduct by speech is pure, and who from time to time gains an opening in the mind, a state of mental clarity, one should focus on their pure bodily conduct, on their pure conduct by speech, and on the mental clarity they gain from time to time. In this way, resentment towards that person should be removed. Friends, when the mind is developed in such an all-around pleasing way towards such a person, it becomes serene.\n\nThese are the five ways, friends, by which a bhikkhu should completely remove resentment when it has arisen."}

On that occasion, the Blessed One was sitting in the open air, surrounded by the bhikkhu assembly, on the full moon night of the Uposatha (observance day) of the fifteenth.\n\nThen, a certain bhikkhu rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms towards the Blessed One, and said:\n\n\"Venerable sir, I would ask the Blessed One about a certain matter, if the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity for my question to be answered?\"\n\n\"Then, bhikkhu, sit down on your own seat and ask whatever you wish.\"\n\n\"Very well, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu replied, having assented to the Blessed One's response. He sat down on his own seat and asked the Blessed One:\n\n\"Are these, venerable sir, the five aggregates subject to clinging, namely: form aggregate subject to clinging, feeling aggregate subject to clinging, perception aggregate subject to clinging, volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, and consciousness aggregate subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"These, bhikkhu, are indeed the five aggregates subject to clinging; namely: form aggregate subject to clinging, feeling aggregate subject to clinging, perception aggregate subject to clinging, volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, and consciousness aggregate subject to clinging.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu, pleased and appreciative of what the Blessed One had said, asked another question:\n\n\"What, venerable sir, is the root of these five aggregates subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, these five aggregates subject to clinging have desire as their root\".\n\n\"Venerable sir, is that very clinging the same as these five aggregates subject to clinging, or is it something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhu, that very clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates subject to clinging nor is it something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging; but whatever desire and lust is therein, that is the clinging therein.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"Is it possible, venerable sir, for there to be moderation in desire and lust within these five aggregates subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"It is possible, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said:\n\n\"Here, bhikkhu, someone thinks: 'May I be of such form in the future, may I have such feeling in the future, may I have such perception in the future, may I have such volitional formations in the future, may I have such consciousness in the future.' Thus, bhikkhu, there can be moderation in desire and lust within these five aggregates subject to clinging.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"How far, venerable sir, does the term 'aggregates' apply?\"\n\n\"Whatever form, bhikkhu, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the form aggregate. Whatever feeling, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the feeling aggregate. Whatever perception, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the perception aggregate. Whatever volitional formations, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the volitional formations aggregate. Whatever consciousness, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the consciousness aggregate. Thus far, bhikkhu, the term 'aggregates' applies.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"What, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the form aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the perception aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate?\"\n\n\"The four great elements, bhikkhu, are the cause, the four great elements are the condition for the manifestation of the form aggregate. Contact is the cause, contact is the condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate. Contact is the cause, contact is the condition for the manifestation of the perception aggregate. Contact is the cause, contact is the condition for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregate. Name-and-form is the cause, name-and-form is the condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"How does self-view arise?\"\n\n\"Here, bhikkhu, an uninstructed ordinary person, who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or self as in form; regards feeling as self, or self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or self as in feeling; regards perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or self as in perception; regards volitional formations as self, or self as possessing volitional formations, or volitional formations as in the self, or self as in volitional formations; regards consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or self as in consciousness. This is how self-view arises, bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"How does self-view not arise?\"\n\n\"Here, bhikkhu, a learned noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or self as in form; does not regard feeling as self, or self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or self as in feeling; does not regard perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or self as in perception; does not regard volitional formations as self, or self as possessing volitional formations, or volitional formations as in the self, or self as in volitional formations; does not regard consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or self as in consciousness. This is how self-view does not arise, bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"What is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of form; what is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness?\"\n\n\"The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on form, bhikkhu, that is the gratification in form. That form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in form. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for form, that is the escape from form. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on feeling, that is the gratification in feeling. That feeling is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in feeling. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for feeling, that is the escape from feeling. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on perception, that is the gratification in perception. That perception is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in perception. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for perception, that is the escape from perception. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on volitional formations, that is the gratification in volitional formations. That volitional formations are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in volitional formations. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for volitional formations, that is the escape from volitional formations. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on consciousness, that is the gratification in consciousness. That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in consciousness. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for consciousness, that is the escape from consciousness.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu, pleased and appreciative of what the Blessed One had said, asked another question:\n\n\"How, venerable sir, for one who knows and sees, in this very life, with regard to this consciousness-containing body and all external signs, is there no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit?\"\n\n\"Whatever form, bhikkhu, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all form: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever feeling, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all feeling: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever perception, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all perception: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever volitional formations, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all volitional formations: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever consciousness, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. This is how, bhikkhu, for one who knows and sees, in this very life, with regard to this consciousness-containing body and all external signs, there is no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit.\"\n\nAt that time, it occurred to a certain bhikkhu:\n\n\"So it seems, indeed, form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, volitional formations are not-self, consciousness is not-self; how then do actions performed by a not-self affect oneself?\"\n\nThen, the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thought in that bhikkhu's mind, addressed the bhikkhus:\n\n\"There is this possibility, bhikkhus, that someone, being ignorant (misapprehending true reality), under the sway of craving, might thus misinterpret the teaching: 'So it seems, indeed, form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, volitional formations are not-self, consciousness is not-self. How then do actions performed by a not-self affect oneself?' You should be trained in this way, bhikkhus, regarding these matters.\n\nWhat do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Is feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\"\n\n\"Suffering, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?\"\n\n\"It is not fitting, venerable sir.\"\n\nTherefore, in this way, bhikkhus, one understands: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self' with regard to all forms, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near. By seeing these aggregates in this way, one becomes disenchanted with form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Through disenchantment, one becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, one is liberated. With liberation, there comes the knowledge that one is liberated, and one understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'\n\nThese are the ten questions posed by the bhikkhu:\nTwo concern the aggregates\u2014\nAsking if they are the same or distinct,\nAnd about designation along with cause.\nTwo more relate to identity,\nWith one each on the themes of gratification,\nAnd the consciousness-containing body."}

What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the formations aggregate subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging.\n\nSo long as I, bhikkhus, did not fully understand these five aggregates subject to clinging in every aspect as they really are, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its gods, M\u0101ras, and Brahm\u0101s, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. But when I, bhikkhus, fully understood these five aggregates subject to clinging in every aspect as they really are, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its gods, M\u0101ras, and Brahm\u0101s, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.\n\nAnd how did I fully understand it in every aspect? I understood form, the arising of form, the cessation of form, and the path leading to the cessation of form; I understood feeling, the arising of feeling, the cessation of feeling, and the path leading to the cessation of feeling; I understood perception, the arising of perception, the cessation of perception, and the path leading to the cessation of perception; I understood formations (volitions/choices), the arising of formations, the cessation of formations, and the path leading to the cessation of formations; I understood consciousness, the arising of consciousness, the cessation of consciousness, and the path leading to the cessation of consciousness.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is form? The four great elements and the form dependent on the four great elements. This is called form. With the arising of nutriment, there is the arising of form; with the cessation of nutriment, there is the cessation of form. The Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of form, that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right collectedness.\n\nFor whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood form, understood the arising of form, understood the cessation of form, and understood the path leading to the cessation of form, and have practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of form, they are well-practiced. Those who are well-practiced have gained footing in this Dhamma and Discipline.\n\nAnd for whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood form \u2026 and practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of form, they are fully liberated. Those who are fully liberated are consummate ones. For consummate ones, there is no further round of existence to be described.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is feeling? There are these six classes of feeling: feeling born of eye-contact, feeling born of ear-contact, feeling born of nose-contact, feeling born of tongue-contact, feeling born of body-contact, feeling born of mind-contact. This is called feeling. With the arising of contact, there is the arising of feeling; with the cessation of contact, there is the cessation of feeling. The Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of feeling, that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right collectedness.\n\nFor whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood feeling, understood the arising of feeling, understood the cessation of feeling, and understood the path leading to the cessation of feeling, and have practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of feeling, they are well-practiced. Those who are well-practiced have gained footing in this Dhamma and Discipline.\n\nAnd for whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood feeling, understood the arising of feeling, understood the cessation of feeling, and understood the path leading to the cessation of feeling, and have practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of feeling, they are fully liberated. Those who are fully liberated are consummate ones. For consummate ones, there is no further round of existence to be described.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is perception? There are these six classes of perception: perception of forms, perception of sounds, perception of odors, perception of tastes, perception of tactile sensations, perception of mental phenomena. This is called perception. With the arising of contact, there is the arising of perception; with the cessation of contact, there is the cessation of perception. The Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of perception, that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right collectedness.\u2026 For those, there is no further round of existence to be described.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, are formations? There are these six classes of intention: intention regarding forms, intention regarding sounds, intention regarding odors, intention regarding tastes, intention regarding tactile sensations, intention regarding mental phenomena. These are called formations. With the arising of contact, there is the arising of formations; with the cessation of contact, there is the cessation of formations. The Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of formations, that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right collectedness.\n\nFor whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood formations, understood the arising of formations, understood the cessation of formations, and understood the path leading to the cessation of formations, and have practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of formations, they are well-practiced. Those who are well-practiced have gained footing in this Dhamma and Discipline.\n\nAnd for whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood formations understood the arising of formations, understood the cessation of formations, and understood the path leading to the cessation of formations, and practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of formations, they are fully liberated. Those who are fully liberated are consummate ones. For consummate ones, there is no further round of existence to be described.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is consciousness? There are these six classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness. This is called consciousness. With the arising of name-and-form, there is the arising of consciousness; with the cessation of name-and-form, there is the cessation of consciousness. The Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of consciousness, that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right collectedness.\n\nFor whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood consciousness, understood the arising of consciousness, understood the cessation of consciousness, and understood the path leading to the cessation of consciousness, and have practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of consciousness, they are well-practiced. Those who are well-practiced have gained footing in this Dhamma and Discipline.\n\nAnd for whatever ascetics and brahmins who have thus understood consciousness \u2026 and practiced accordingly for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of consciousness, they are fully liberated. Those who are fully liberated are consummate ones. For consummate ones, there is no further round of existence to be described.\""}

Seated to one side, the brahmin U\u1e47\u1e47\u0101bha said to the Venerable \u0100nanda: \"Master \u0100nanda, for what purpose is the spiritual life lived under the ascetic Gotama?\"\n\n\"Brahmin, it is for the purpose of abandoning desire that the spiritual life is lived under the Blessed One.\"\n\n\"But, Master \u0100nanda, is there a path, is there a way to abandon this desire?\"\n\n\"Yes, brahmin, there is a path, there is a way to abandon this desire.\"\n\n\"What, then, is the path, what is the way to abandon this desire?\"\n\n\"Here, brahmin, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from desire (an aspiration, a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort; develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort; and develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort. This, brahmin, is the path, this is the way to abandon this desire.\"\n\n\"In that case, Master \u0100nanda, it would be impossible to abandon desire by means of desire itself.\"\n\n\"Then, brahmin, I will ask you a question. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin: Did you earlier have the desire, 'I will go to the park,' and now that you have come to the park, has that desire you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you earlier arouse energy, thinking, 'I will go to the park,' and now that you have come to the park, has that energy you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you earlier resolve in your mind, 'I will go to the park,' and now that you have come to the park, has that resolution in the mind you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master \u0100nanda.\"\n\n\"Did you earlier make an investigation, 'Shall I go to the park?' and now that you have come to the park, has that investigation you had before to come to the park been abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In the same way, brahmin, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints have been exhausted, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, utterly exhausted the fetters of existence, and is completely liberated through final knowledge, the desire that he had before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. The energy that he had aroused before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. The resolution in the mind that he had before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. The investigation that he had made before for the attainment of arahantship is abandoned once arahantship is attained. What do you think, brahmin, such being the case, does the [path] have an end or is it endless?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Master \u0100nanda, in such a case, the [path] has an end, it is not endless. Excellent, Master \u0100nanda, excellent. It is as if one were to set upright what had been overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to hold a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms. So, too, Master \u0100nanda has, in many ways, made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu Sa\u1e45gha. Let Master \u0100nanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day onward, for life.\""}

After exchanging friendly and courteous words, he sat down to one side.

He finds a large banana plant, straight, fresh, without any fruit-bud. He cuts it at the root, cuts off the top, and peels away the outer layers. Yet, in doing so, he would find neither heartwood nor sapwood, let alone heartwood.\n\nLikewise, friend, a bhikkhu does not regard the six sense bases as self or as belonging to a self. With such perception, he does not cling to anything in the world. Without clinging, he is not perturbed. Without perturbation, he personally attains Nibb\u0101na.\n\nHe realizes: 'Birth is extinguished, the spiritual life has been lived, the task is done, there is nothing further for this state of being.'\""}
