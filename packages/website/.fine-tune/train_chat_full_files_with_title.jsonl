Listen to it and pay close attention, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n\"And what, bhikkhus, is the penetrative exposition, the dhamma exposition? Sensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the result of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood.\n\nFeelings, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of feelings is to be understood; the diversity of feelings is to be understood; the result of feelings is to be understood; the cessation of feelings is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of feelings is to be understood.\n\nPerceptions, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of perceptions is to be understood; the diversity of perceptions is to be understood; the result of perceptions is to be understood; the cessation of perceptions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of perceptions is to be understood.\n\nTaints, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of taints is to be understood; the diversity of taints is to be understood; the result of taints is to be understood; the cessation of taints is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of taints is to be understood.\n\nActions (kamma), bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of actions is to be understood; the diversity of actions is to be understood; the result of actions is to be understood; the cessation of actions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of actions is to be understood.\n\nSuffering (dukkha), bhikkhus, is to be understood; the origin of suffering is to be understood; the diversity of suffering is to be understood; the result of suffering is to be understood; the cessation of suffering is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of suffering is to be understood.\n\nSensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the diversity of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the result of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood. And what is the basis for this statement? There are these five cords of sensual pleasure: forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing; sounds cognizable by the ear... odors cognizable by the nose... tastes cognizable by the tongue... tangibles cognizable by the body that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and enticing. However, these are not sensual pleasures; these are sensual strands, in the discipline of the noble ones, it is said:\n\nThe passion and desire for them is the sensual pleasure,\nThe things in the world that are beautiful,\nThe passion and desire for them is the sensual pleasure,\nThey remain beautiful in the world,\nBut the wise abandon desire for them.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of sensual pleasures? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of sensual pleasures.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of sensual pleasures? One kind of desire arises from forms, another kind of desire arises from sounds, another kind of desire arises from odors, another kind of desire arises from tastes, another kind of desire arises from tangibles. This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of sensual pleasures? Bhikkhus, the one who desires and delights in sensual pleasures, by that very desire, produces repeated existence in favorable or unfavorable conditions. This is called the result of sensual pleasures.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of sensual pleasures? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of sensual pleasures. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands sensual pleasures, understands the origin of sensual pleasures, understands the diversity of sensual pleasures, understands the result of sensual pleasures, understands the cessation of sensual pleasures, understands the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures. Sensual pleasures, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of sensual pleasures is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nFeelings, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of feelings is to be understood; the diversity of feelings is to be understood; the result of feelings is to be understood; the cessation of feelings is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of feelings is to be understood. And why was this said? There are, bhikkhus, these three kinds of feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of feelings? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of feelings.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of feelings? There is, bhikkhus, sensual pleasant feeling, there is non-sensual pleasant feeling, there is sensual painful feeling, there is non-sensual painful feeling, there is sensual neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, and there is non-sensual neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. This is called the diversity of feelings.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of feelings? Bhikkhus, the one who experiences feelings produces repeated existence in favorable or unfavorable conditions. This is called the result of feelings.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of feelings? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of feelings. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of feelings, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands feelings, understands the origin of feelings, understands the diversity of feelings, understands the result of feelings, understands the cessation of feelings, understands the path leading to the cessation of feelings, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of feelings. Feelings, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of feelings is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nPerceptions, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of perceptions is to be understood; the diversity of perceptions is to be understood; the result of perceptions is to be understood; the cessation of perceptions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of perceptions is to be understood. And why was this said? There are, bhikkhus, these six kinds of perceptions: perception of forms, perception of sounds, perception of odors, perception of tastes, perception of tangibles, perception of mental phenomena.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of perceptions? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of perceptions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of perceptions? One kind of perception arises from forms, another kind of perception arises from sounds, another kind of perception arises from smells, another kind of perception arises from tastes, another kind of perception arises from tangibles, another kind of perception arises from mental phenomena. This is called the diversity of perceptions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of perceptions? Bhikkhus, I say that perception results in verbal expression. As one perceives, so one speaks. Thus one becomes a perceiver. This is called the result of perceptions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of perceptions? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of perceptions. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of perceptions, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands perceptions, understands the origin of perceptions, understands the diversity of perceptions, understands the result of perceptions, understands the cessation of perceptions, understands the path leading to the cessation of perceptions, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of perceptions. Perceptions, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of perceptions is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nTaints, bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of taints is to be understood; the diversity of taints is to be understood; the result of taints is to be understood; the cessation of taints is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of taints is to be understood. And why was this said? There are, bhikkhus, these three taints: the taint of sensual pleasure, the taint of existence, the taint of ignorance (unknowing of how things have come to be, unknowing of \"true reality\").\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of taints? Ignorance, bhikkhus, is the origin of taints.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of taints? There are, bhikkhus, taints that lead to rebirth in hell, taints that lead to rebirth in the animal realm, taints that lead to rebirth in the ghost realm, taints that lead to rebirth in the human world, taints that lead to rebirth in the deva world. This is called the diversity of taints.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of taints? Bhikkhus, one who is subject to ignorance produces repeated existence in favorable or unfavorable conditions. This is called the result of taints.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of taints? The cessation of ignorance, bhikkhus, is the cessation of taints. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of taints, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands taints, understands the origin of taints, understands the diversity of taints, understands the result of taints, understands the cessation of taints, understands the path leading to the cessation of taints, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of taints. Taints, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of taints is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nActions (kamma), bhikkhus, are to be understood; the origin of actions is to be understood; the diversity of actions is to be understood; the result of actions is to be understood; the cessation of actions is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of actions is to be understood. And why was this said? I say, bhikkhus, that intention is action. Having intended, one acts by body, speech, and mind.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of actions? Contact, bhikkhus, is the origin of actions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of actions? There is, bhikkhus, action that leads to rebirth in hell, action that leads to rebirth in the animal realm, action that leads to rebirth in the ghost realm, action that leads to rebirth in the human world, action that leads to rebirth in the deva world. This is called the diversity of actions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of actions? I say, bhikkhus, that there are three kinds of results of actions: results that are experienced in this very life, results that are experienced upon rebirth, and results that are experienced in future lives. This is called the result of actions.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of actions? The cessation of contact, bhikkhus, is the cessation of actions. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of actions, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands actions, understands the origin of actions, understands the diversity of actions, understands the result of actions, understands the cessation of actions, understands the path leading to the cessation of actions, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of actions. Actions, bhikkhus, are to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of actions is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nSuffering (dukkha), bhikkhus, is to be understood; the origin of suffering is to be understood; the diversity of suffering is to be understood; the result of suffering is to be understood; the cessation of suffering is to be understood; the path leading to the cessation of suffering is to be understood. And why was this said? Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair are suffering; association with the unloved is suffering; separation from the loved is suffering; not getting what one wants is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering? Craving, bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of suffering? There is, bhikkhus, intense suffering, there is mild suffering (discontentment), there is slow-fading suffering, there is rapid-fading suffering. This is called the diversity of suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the result of suffering? Here, bhikkhus, someone who is overwhelmed by suffering and whose mind is exhausted grieves, laments, cries, beats their breast, becomes confused, or seeks external solutions: 'Who knows a remedy for this suffering?' I say, bhikkhus, that suffering results in either confusion or external seeking. This is called the result of suffering.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of suffering? The cessation of craving, bhikkhus, is the cessation of suffering. And this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of suffering, namely, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\nWhen a noble disciple thus understands suffering, understands the origin of suffering, understands the diversity of suffering, understands the result of suffering, understands the cessation of suffering, understands the path leading to the cessation of suffering, he understands this penetrative spiritual life leading to the cessation of suffering. Suffering, bhikkhus, is to be understood... and the path leading to the cessation of suffering is to be understood. Therefore, it was said based on this.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the penetrative exposition, the dhamma exposition.\""}]}

Listen well and pay close attention; I will speak.\"\n\n\"Indeed, venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:\n\n### Fourty-Four Bases of Knowledge\n\n\"What, bhikkhus, are the forty-four bases of knowledge? Knowledge of aging and death, knowledge of the arising of aging and death, knowledge of the cessation of aging and death, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging and death; knowledge of birth, knowledge of the arising of birth, knowledge of the cessation of birth, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of birth; knowledge of continued existence, knowledge of the arising of continued existence, knowledge of the cessation of continued existence, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of continued existence; knowledge of clinging, knowledge of the arising of clinging, knowledge of the cessation of clinging, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of clinging; knowledge of craving, knowledge of the arising of craving, knowledge of the cessation of craving, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of craving; knowledge of feeling, knowledge of the arising of feeling, knowledge of the cessation of feeling, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of feeling; knowledge of contact, knowledge of the arising of contact, knowledge of the cessation of contact, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of contact; knowledge of the six sense bases, knowledge of the arising of the six sense bases, knowledge of the cessation of the six sense bases, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of the six sense bases; knowledge of name-and-form, knowledge of the arising of name-and-form, knowledge of the cessation of name-and-form, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of name-and-form; knowledge of consciousness, knowledge of the arising of consciousness, knowledge of the cessation of consciousness, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousness; knowledge of volitional formations, knowledge of the arising of volitional formations, knowledge of the cessation of volitional formations, knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations. These are called, bhikkhus, the forty-four bases of knowledge.\n\n#### Aging and Death\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is aging and death? The aging is the aging of various beings in their respective species, the wear and tear, the breaking down, the falling apart, the wrinkling, and the decline of life, the maturity of the faculties. This is called aging. The cutting off from, the passing away from, the dissolution of, the disappearance of, the dying, the completion of time, the breaking up of the aggregates, the laying down of the body, of various beings in their respective species. This is called death. Thus, this is aging and this is death; this is called, bhikkhus, aging and death.\n\nThe arising of birth is the arising of aging and death; the cessation of birth is the cessation of aging and death; this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, that is — right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple understands aging and death, understands the arising of aging and death, understands the cessation of aging and death, understands the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, this is his knowledge of the Dhamma. By this Dhamma seen and known directly, immediately, attained and grasped, he transcends the past and the future.\n\n'Whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past fully understood aging and death, the arising of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, all fully understood in the same way as I do now.\n\nAnd whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will fully understand aging and death, the arising of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, the path leading to the cessation of aging and death, all will fully understand in the same way as I do now.' This is his knowledge by way of inference.\n\n#### Endowed with Right View\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple's these two knowledges are purified and cleansed — knowledge of the Dhamma (clear apprehension of how things have come to be) and knowledge by way of inference. This is called, bhikkhus, a noble disciple endowed with right view, endowed with right vision, arrived at this true Dhamma, seeing this true Dhamma, equipped with the trainee's knowledge, equipped with the trainee's wisdom, attained to the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, stands touching the door to the deathless.\"\n\n#### Volitional Formations\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is birth... what, bhikkhus, is continued existence... what, bhikkhus, is clinging... what, bhikkhus, is craving... what, bhikkhus, is feeling... what, bhikkhus, is contact... what, bhikkhus, are the six sense bases... what, bhikkhus, is name-and-form... what, bhikkhus, is consciousness... what, bhikkhus, are volitional formations? There are these three volitional formations: bodily formations, verbal formations, mental formations. These are called, bhikkhus, volitional formations.\n\nThe arising of ignorance is the arising of volitional formations; the cessation of ignorance is the cessation of volitional formations; this very Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, that is — right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right collectedness.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple understands volitional formations, understands the arising of volitional formations, understands the cessation of volitional formations, understands the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, this is his knowledge of the Dhamma. By this Dhamma seen and known directly, immediately, attained and grasped, he transcends the past and the future.\n\nWhatever ascetics or brahmins in the past fully understood volitional formations, the arising of volitional formations, the cessation of volitional formations, the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, all fully understood in the same way as I do now.\n\nAnd whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will fully understand volitional formations, the arising of volitional formations, the cessation of volitional formations, the path leading to the cessation of volitional formations, all will fully understand in the same way as I do now. This is his knowledge by way of inference.\n\nWhen, bhikkhus, a noble disciple's these two knowledges are purified and cleansed — knowledge of the Dhamma (clear apprehension of how things have come to be) and knowledge by way of inference. This is called, bhikkhus, a noble disciple endowed with right view, endowed with right vision, arrived at this true Dhamma, seeing this true Dhamma, equipped with the trainee's knowledge, equipped with the trainee's wisdom, attained to the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, stands touching the door to the deathless.\""}]}

My mind is free from passion,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is free from aversion,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is free from delusion,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is free from the tendencies of passion,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is free from the tendencies of aversion,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is free from the tendencies of delusion,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is not turning towards the sense realm,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is not turning towards the form realm,' thus the mind is well-composed; 'My mind is not turning towards the formless realm,' thus the mind is well-composed.\n\nThus, friend, when a bhikkhu's mind is rightly released, even if many forms cognizable by the eye come into the range of the eye, they do not obsess the mind; the mind remains untainted, steady, and attained to imperturbability, and he observes their passing away.\n\nJust as, friend, a stone pillar sixteen spans deep stands firm. It has eight parts below well-fixed, and eight parts above. If strong wind and rain were to come from the east, it would neither shake nor tremble; if strong wind and rain were to come from the west, from the north, from the south, it would neither shake nor tremble. And why is that? Because of the depth and the well-planted nature of the stone pillar. So too, friend, when a bhikkhu's mind is rightly released, even if many forms cognizable by the eye come into the range of the eye, they do not obsess the mind; the mind remains untainted, steady, and attained to imperturbability, and he observes their passing away.\n\nEven if many sounds cognizable by the ear, odors cognizable by the nose, tastes cognizable by the tongue, tactile objects cognizable by the body, or mental objects cognizable by the mind come into the range of the mind, they do not obsess the mind; the mind remains untainted, steady, and attained to imperturbability, and he observes their passing away.\""}]}

There, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: \"Friends, bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" those bhikkhus replied to Venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta said:\n\n\"'Right view, right view,' is said, friends. To what extent, friends, does a noble disciple possess right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma?\"\n\n\"Even from far away, friend, we would come to learn the meaning of this statement from the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.

After hearing it from Venerable Sāriputta, the bhikkhus will remember it.\"\n\n\"Then listen, friends, and pay close attention, I will speak,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" those bhikkhus replied to Venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta said:\n\n### The Unwholesome and the Wholesome\n\n\"When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome — to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\n\nWhat, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the unwholesome, what is the wholesome, what is the root of the wholesome? Taking life, friends, is unwholesome; taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, covetousness, ill-will, and wrong view — this, friends, is called unwholesome.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the root of the unwholesome? Passion (lust, desire, attachment) is an unwholesome root, aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment) is an unwholesome root, delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification) is an unwholesome root— this, friends, is called the root of the unwholesome.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the wholesome? Abstaining from taking life is wholesome, abstaining from taking what is not given, abstaining from sexual misconduct, abstaining from lying, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from harsh speech, abstaining from idle chatter, non-covetousness, good-will, and right view — this, friends, is called wholesome.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the root of the wholesome? Contentment is a wholesome root, good-will is a wholesome root, wisdom (choosing to carefully examine and independently verify) is a wholesome root — this, friends, is called the root of the wholesome.\n\nWhen, friends, a noble disciple thus understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to passion, dispels the underlying tendency to aversion, eradicates the underlying tendency to the view 'I am', by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge, in this very life makes an end of suffering (discontentment, stress) — to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\"\n\n\"Good, friend!\" those bhikkhus satisfied and rejoiced in Venerable Sāriputta's words, and then they asked him a further question: \"Might there be another way in which a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma?\"\n\n### Nutriment\n\n\"There might be, friends. When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment and the origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the path leading to the cessation of nutriment — to this extent, friends, a noble disciple possesses right view, his view straight, equipped with experiential confidence in the Dhamma, having arrived at this true Dhamma.\n\nWhat, friends, is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, what is the cessation of nutriment, what is the path leading to the cessation of nutriment? There are these four nutriments, friends, for the maintenance of beings that have come to be and for the support of those seeking to be. What are the four?

Greed (lust, desire, attachment), aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment), and delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification).\n\nGreed is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by greed chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, due to greed, originating from greed, arising from greed, dependent on greed, many evil, unwholesome states come to be.\n\nHate is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by hate chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. And so these many bad, unwholesome things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by hate. Thus, due to hate, originating from hate, arising from hate, dependent on hate, many evil, unwholesome states come to be.\n\nDelusion is a root of the unwholesome. When a person overcome by delusion chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unwholesome. When a such a person causes another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is unwholesome. Thus, due to delusion, originating from delusion, arising from delusion, dependent on delusion, many evil, unwholesome states come to be. Such a person, bhikkhus, is called a speaker at the wrong time, speaker of falsehoods, speaker of what is not beneficial, speaker against the Dhamma, speaker against discipline.\n\nWhy, bhikkhus, is such a person called a speaker at the wrong time, speaker of falsehoods, speaker of what is not beneficial, speaker against the Dhamma, speaker against discipline? Because, bhikkhus, this person causes suffering to another through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. When spoken to truthfully, he disregards it, does not acknowledge it; when spoken to untruthfully, he does not make an effort to clarify, saying 'this is false, this is untrue.' Therefore, such a person is called a speaker at the wrong time, speaker of falsehoods, speaker of what is not beneficial, speaker against the Dhamma, speaker against discipline.\n\nSuch a person, bhikkhus, overwhelmed, with a mind overwhelmed by evil, unwholesome states of greed, hate and delusion, experiences suffering in this very life, with distress, with misery, with agony. And after the breakup of the body, after death, rebirth in a state of deprivation is to be expected. Suppose a sal, dhava (axlewood), or a bamboo was choked and engulfed by three kinds of creepers, it would fall to ruin and disaster. In the same way, such a person—overcome with bad, unwholesome qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion—suffers in the present life, with anguish, distress, and fever. And when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect to be reborn in a bad place.\n\nThese are the three unwholesome roots.\n\nThere are these three wholesome roots. What three? Contentment, good-will (loving-kindness), and wisdom (inclination to carefully examine and independently verify).\n\nContentment is a root of the wholesome. When a contented person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by greed, doesn't cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, due to contentment, originating from contentment, arising from contentment, dependent on contentment, many wholesome states come to be.\n\nGood-will is a root of the wholesome. When a loving person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, not overcome by hate, doesn't cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, due to good-will, originating from good-will, arising from good-will, dependent on good-will, many wholesome states come to be.\n\nWisdom is a root of the wholesome. When a wise person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is wholesome. When such a person, with a mind not overcome by delusion, doesn't cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance, that too is wholesome. Thus, due to wisdom, originating from wisdom, arising from wisdom, dependent on wisdom, many wholesome states come to be. Such a person, bhikkhus, is called a speaker at the right time, a speaker of truths, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker in accordance with the Dhamma, a speaker in accordance with discipline.\n\nWhy, bhikkhus, is such a person called a speaker at the right time, a speaker of truths, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker in accordance with the Dhamma, a speaker in accordance with discipline? Because, bhikkhus, this person does not cause another to suffer through killing or binding, theft or censure, banishment or various forms of oppression with the mindset of power and dominance. When spoken to truthfully, they acknowledge it and do not scorn; when spoken to untruthfully, they make an effort to clarify, saying 'this is false, this is untrue.' Therefore, such a person is called a speaker at the right time, a speaker of truths, a speaker of what is beneficial, a speaker in accordance with the Dhamma, a speaker in accordance with discipline.\n\nFor such a person, bhikkhus, bad unwholesome qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In the present life, they live happily, free of anguish, distress, and fever. In the present life, they are extinguished.\n\nSuppose, bhikkhus, a sal tree, or an axlewood, or a bamboo was choked and engulfed by three kinds of creepers. Then a person comes with a spade and basket. They would cut the creeper at the root, dig it up, and pull it out, down to the fibers and stems. Then they would split the creeper apart, cut up the parts, and chop it into splinters. They would dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they would sweep away the ashes in a strong wind or float them away down a swift stream. In the same way, bhikkhus, for such a person, bad unwholesome qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In the present life, they live happily, free of anguish, distress, and fever. In the present life, they are extinguished.\n\nThese, bhikkhus, are the three wholesome roots."}]}

And the Dhamma he teaches for the purpose indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering (stress/tension/discontentment).\"\n\nThen, when it was early morning, the venerable Sāriputta, having put on robe, and taking his bowl, entered Vesāli for alms. The venerable Sāriputta heard Sunakkhatta, the son of the Licchavis, making this statement before the Vesāli assembly: \"The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones. The ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition. And the Dhamma he teaches for the purpose indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering.\"\n\nThen, the venerable Sāriputta, having wandered for alms in Vesāli and having returned from the alms-round after the meal, approached the Blessed One. Having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the venerable Sāriputta said this to the Blessed One: \"Sunakkhatta, venerable sir, the son of the Licchavis, has recently departed from this Dhamma and discipline. He speaks thus in the assembly at Vesāli: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones. The ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition. And the Dhamma he teaches for the purpose indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering.'\"\n\n\"Sāriputta, the misguided person Sunakkhatta is angry. And this statement was spoken out of anger. Intending to disparage, Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta, the misguided person, actually speaks praise of the Tathāgata. For, Sāriputta, it is praise of the Tathāgata for one to say: 'The Dhamma he teaches indeed rightly leads the one acting accordingly to the ending of suffering.'\n\nIt is possible, Sāriputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One, the worthy one, the perfectly awakened one, accomplished in wisdom and moral conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be trained, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.'\n\nIt is possible, Sāriputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One who experiences various types of supernormal powers — becoming one, he becomes many; becoming many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he goes unhindered through walls, enclosures, and mountains as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if in water; he walks on water without breaking the surface as if on land; he flies cross-legged through the sky like a bird; he touches and strokes the moon and sun, mighty and powerful; he even reaches the Brahmā world with his body.'\n\nIt is possible, Sāriputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One who, with his purified divine ear element surpassing that of humans, hears both kinds of sounds, divine and human, whether far or near.'\n\nIt is possible, Sāriputta, that the misguided person Sunakkhatta will not have an understanding about the Dhamma concerning me: 'Thus indeed he is the Blessed One who comprehends with his own mind the minds of other beings, other individuals. He knows a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; he knows a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; he knows a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; he knows a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; he knows an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; he knows a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; he knows a collected mind as collected and an uncollected mind as uncollected; he knows a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.'\n\n### The Ten Tathāgata Powers\n\nSāriputta, there are these ten Tathāgata powers endowed with which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion. Which ten?\n\nHere, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata knows, as it actually is, the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata knows the outcomes of actions performed in the past, future, and present according to their causes and conditions, as they actually are. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata knows the path leading to all destinations as it actually is. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata knows the world with multiple diverse elements as they actually are. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata knows the various inclinations of beings as they actually are. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata knows the different faculties of other beings and individuals as they actually are. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata knows the defilement, purification, and emergence of jhānas, liberations, and samādhi attainments as they actually are. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past lives in detail, such as one birth, two births, and so forth, up to hundreds of thousands of births, including names, clans, appearances, experiences, and locations. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata sees beings passing away and arising, with his divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision. He knows beings as lowly or exalted, beautiful or ugly, fortunate or unfortunate, according to their actions. He knows those who are engaged in bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct, who disparage the noble ones and hold wrong views, and their resulting fate in unfortunate realms. He also knows those who are engaged in bodily, verbal, and mental good conduct, who do not disparage the noble ones and hold right views, and their resulting fate in fortunate realms. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nFurther, again, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata dwells having personally realized with direct knowledge the wearing away of the taints, experiencing the liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, in the visible state. This too is a Tathāgata power, by which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nSāriputta, these are the ten Tathāgata powers endowed with which the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nSāriputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, Sāriputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Four Confidences\n\nSāriputta, these are the four confidences possessed by the Tathāgata. With these confidences, the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion. What are these four?\n\nIf someone were to claim that the realizations of the perfectly self-awakened one are not fully complete, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, Sāriputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nIf someone were to claim that the taints are not fully eradicated in one whose taints are fully eradicated, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, Sāriputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nIf someone were to claim that the things described as obstructive are not sufficient to cause obstruction when followed, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, Sāriputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nIf someone were to claim that the Dhamma taught does not lead to the cessation of suffering for one who practices rightly, I do not see any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world who could rightly challenge this. Not seeing such a possibility, Sāriputta, I dwell securely, fearlessly, and confidently.\n\nThese, Sāriputta, are the four confidences of the Tathāgata. Endowed with these confidences, the Tathāgata claims the foremost position, roars the lion's roar in assemblies, and sets the wheel of the Dhamma in motion.\n\nSāriputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, Sāriputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Eight Assemblies\n\nThere are eight assemblies, Sāriputta. Which eight? The assembly of nobles, the assembly of brahmins, the assembly of householders, the assembly of ascetics, the assembly of the Four Great Kings, the assembly of the Thirty-Three Gods, the assembly of Māra, and the assembly of Brahmā — these, Sāriputta, are the eight assemblies. Endowed with these four confidences, the Tathāgata approaches and engages with these eight assemblies. I know, Sāriputta, that I have approached many hundreds of assemblies of nobles. There too, I have previously sat, conversed, and engaged in discussion. I do not see any indication, Sāriputta, that fear or timidity would descend upon me there. Not seeing this possibility, Sāriputta, I dwell having attained security, fearlessness, and confidence.\n\nI know, Sāriputta, that I have approached many hundreds of assemblies of brahmins, householders, ascetics, the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-Three Gods, Māra, and Brahmā. There too, I have previously sat, conversed, and engaged in discussion. I do not see any indication, Sāriputta, that fear or timidity would descend upon me there. Not seeing this possibility, Sāriputta, I dwell having attained security, fearlessness, and confidence.\n\nSāriputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, Sāriputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Four Types of Birth\n\nThere are four types of births, Sāriputta. Which four? Egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, and spontaneously-born.\n\nAnd which, Sāriputta, is the egg-born birth? Those beings, Sāriputta, who are born breaking through an egg-shell — this, Sāriputta, is called the egg-born birth. And which, Sāriputta, is the womb-born birth? Those beings, Sāriputta, who are born breaking through a membrane — this, Sāriputta, is called the womb-born birth. And which, Sāriputta, is the moisture-born birth? Those beings, Sāriputta, who are born in putrid fish, or in a putrid corpse, or in putrid bean soup, or in a box, or in a cesspool — this, Sāriputta, is called the moisture-born birth. And which, Sāriputta, is the spontaneously-born birth? Gods, hell beings, some humans, and some beings in the lower realms — this, Sāriputta, is called the spontaneously-born birth. These, Sāriputta, are the four types of birth.\n\nSāriputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, Sāriputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Five Destinations and Nibbāna\n\nThere are five future destinations, Sāriputta. Which five? Hell, the animal realm, the realm of ghosts, human beings, and gods.\n\nI know hell, Sāriputta, and the path to hell, and the practice that leads to hell; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in a state of loss, a bad destination, a plane of misery, in hell — I know that too. I know the animal realm, Sāriputta, and the path to the animal realm, and the practice that leads to the animal realm; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in the animal realm — I know that too. I know the realm of ghosts, Sāriputta, and the path to the realm of ghosts, and the practice that leads to the realm of ghosts; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in the realm of ghosts — I know that too. I know human beings, Sāriputta, and the path to the human world, and the practice that leads to the human world; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises among humans — I know that too. I know the gods, Sāriputta, and the path to the world of gods, and the practice that leads to the world of gods; and how someone who practices that way, with the breaking up of the body, after death, arises in a good destination, a heavenly world — I know that too. I know Nibbāna, Sāriputta, and the path to Nibbāna, and the practice that leads to Nibbāna; and how someone who practices that way, with the wearing away of the taints, attains in this very life the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge — I know that too.\n\nHere, Sāriputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — thus, this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful feelings (sensations). Just as, Sāriputta, there is a pit of burning embers, more than a man's height, full of embers without flames, without smoke. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very pit of embers.' At another time, the discerning person would see him fallen into that pit of embers, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful feelings (sensations).\n\nLikewise, Sāriputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a plane of misery, in hell, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations.\n\nFurthermore, here, Sāriputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the animal realm. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the animal realm, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations. Just as, Sāriputta, there is a cesspool greater than a man's height, full of excrement. Then, a person would come, scorched by heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very cesspool.' At another time, the discerning person would see him fallen into that cesspool, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations.\n\nIn the same way, Sāriputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the animal realm. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the animal realm, experiencing intense, sharp, and painful sensations.\n\nFurthermore, Sāriputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the realm of ghosts. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the realm of ghosts, experiencing predominantly painful sensations. Just as, Sāriputta, there is a tree growing on uneven ground, with thin leaves and scanty shade. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very tree.' At another time, the discerning person would see him sitting or lying down in the shade of that tree, experiencing predominantly painful sensations.\n\nIn the same way, Sāriputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in the realm of ghosts. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in the realm of ghosts, experiencing predominantly painful sensations.\n\nHere, Sāriputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn among humans. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, among humans, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. Just as, Sāriputta, there is a tree growing on even ground, with thick leaves and ample shade. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very tree.' At another time, the discerning person would see him sitting or lying down in the shade of that tree, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nIn the same way, Sāriputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn among humans. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, among humans, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nHere, Sāriputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind - 'This person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.' I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a good destination, in a heavenly world, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. Just as, Sāriputta, there is a mansion, with a storied pavilion, plastered and painted, sheltered from the wind, with a fitted door and closed windows. Inside, there is a couch, spread with rugs, coverlets, and blankets, covered with a fine spread of kadali deer skins, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. Then, a person would come, scorched by heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very mansion.' At another time, the discerning person would see him having entered that mansion, lying or sitting on that couch, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nIn the same way, Sāriputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the breaking up of the body, after death, he will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, reborn after the breaking up of the body, after death, in a good destination, in a heavenly world, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nHere, Sāriputta, I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind — this person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the wearing away of the taints, he will attain the undefiled liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge, in this visible state. I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, having realized the wearing away of the taints, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. Just as, Sāriputta, there is a pond with clear, cool, cold water, white and well-situated, delightful. Nearby is a dense grove. Then, a person would come, scorched by the heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, thirsty, and parched, setting forth on that very direct path. Seeing him, a discerning person would say: 'This venerable person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that he will arrive at this very pond.' At another time, the discerning person would see him having entered that pond, bathed, and drunk, having calmed all his heat and exhaustion, sitting or lying down in that grove, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations.\n\nIn the same way, Sāriputta, here I know a certain person by comprehending their mind with my mind - 'This person is practicing in such a way, behaving in such a way, and engaged in such a path that, with the wearing away of the taints, he will attain the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge, in this visible state.' I see him at a later time with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, having realized the wearing away of the taints, experiencing predominantly pleasant sensations. These, Sāriputta, are the five destinations.\n\nSāriputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The ascetic Gotama does not have any superhuman attributes or distinctions in wisdom and vision worthy of noble ones; the ascetic Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, conforming to a mode of investigation, and produced by his own intuition,' without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there. Just as, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, collectedness, and wisdom would attain final knowledge in this very life, so, Sāriputta, I declare this: without abandoning that speech, without abandoning that mind, without relinquishing that view, he will be cast into hell just as he would be if physically carried there.\n\n### The Bodhisatta's Ascetic Practices\n\nI know for myself, Sāriputta, the spiritual life I practiced, endowed with the four factors — I was indeed an ascetic, supremely ascetic, I was indeed coarse, extremely coarse, I was indeed scrupulous in morality, most scrupulous, I was indeed secluded, supremely secluded.\n\nThus, Sāriputta, in my asceticism — I was naked, free from social conventions, scratching with hands, not coming near or standing near the honorable ones; I did not accept food not offered, specially prepared, or offered by invitation. I did not accept food from the mouth of a jar, from the mouth of a pot, from inside a doorway, near a stick, near a club, while two others were eating, from a pregnant woman, from a breastfeeding woman, from a woman among men, in food distribution, where it is served, or where flies swarmed. I did not eat fish or meat, or drink alcohol or fermented drink, or drink water with husks. I would eat in one house, two houses... up to seven houses; I would live on one mouthful of food, two mouthfuls... up to seven mouthfuls; I would sustain myself on one gift, two gifts... up to seven gifts; I would eat food for one day, two days... up to seven days; thus, I was devoted to the practice of eating meals at intervals, sometimes even fortnightly.\n\nI would eat raw greens, wild millet, wild red rice, rice brans, water plants, rice husk powder, rice water, ground sesame, grass, cow dung. I would sustain myself on roots and fruits of the forest, eating fallen fruits.\n\nI wore coarse grass mats, burial cloths, shrouds, rag-robes, bark, hides, cloaks of skin, garments of kusa grass, garments of bark, garments of wood bark, hair blankets, animal hair blankets, and owl feathers. I practiced plucking out my hair and beard, standing on one foot, refusing to sit down, squatting, sleeping on a bed of thorns, and immersing myself in water every third evening. Thus, I engaged in various practices of self-mortification and bodily torment. This, Sāriputta, was my asceticism.\n\nThus, Sāriputta, in my coarseness, a layer of dust accumulated on my body over many years, forming a crust. Just as, Sāriputta, a log of the tinduka tree (ebony tree) accumulates dust and forms a crust over many years, similarly, Sāriputta, a layer of dust accumulated on my body over many years, forming a crust. It did not occur to me, Sāriputta, to wipe this dust off with my hand, nor did I think that others should wipe it off for me. This, Sāriputta, was my coarseness.\n\nThus, Sāriputta, in my scrupulousness, I would walk forward mindfully and walk back mindfully. Even with a drop of water, compassion would arise in me: 'May I not cause harm to even a small creature placed unevenly.' Thus, Sāriputta, this was my scrupulousness.\n\nThus, Sāriputta, in my seclusion, I would enter a certain forest dwelling and reside there. Whenever I saw a cowherd, a shepherd, a grass collector, a wood gatherer, or a forest worker, I would move from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from lowland to lowland, and from highland to highland. Why is that? So that they would not see me and I would not see them. Just as, Sāriputta, a forest-dwelling deer, upon seeing people, moves from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from lowland to lowland, and from highland to highland; similarly, Sāriputta, whenever I saw a cowherd, a shepherd, a grass collector, a wood gatherer, or a forest worker, I would move from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from lowland to lowland, and from highland to highland. Why is that? So that they would not see me and I would not see them. This, Sāriputta, was my seclusion.\n\nThus, Sāriputta, where there were pens with settled cows and no cowherds present, I would approach with a small bowl and collect the cow dung from calves, young ones, and milking cows. As long as my own urine and dung were not exhausted, I would consume only my own urine and dung. This, Sāriputta, was my practice of eating coarse food.\n\nThus, Sāriputta, I would dwell in a certain terrifying forest grove. In that terrifying forest grove, anyone who is not free from passion would mostly have their hair stand on end. During the cold winter nights, in-between seasons, and times of snowfall, I would dwell in the open at night and in the forest grove during the day. In the last month of summer, I would stay in the open during the day and in the forest grove at night. Moreover, Sāriputta, this extraordinary verse, never heard before, occurred to me:\n\n'Emaciated and dried up,\nalone in the terrifying forest;\nNaked, not sitting by a fire,\nthe sage devoted to seeking.'\n\nThus, Sāriputta, I would make my bed in a charnel ground using corpses as a pillow. Furthermore, Sāriputta, village boys would approach and spit upon me, urinate upon me, sprinkle me with dust, and insert sticks into my ears. However, Sāriputta, I do not recall generating any wicked thoughts towards them. Thus, Sāriputta, this was my dwelling in equanimity.\n\nThere are, Sāriputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold the view and say: 'Purification is achieved by food.' They say: 'We sustain ourselves on jujube fruits.' They eat jujube fruits, jujube powder, and drink jujube water — consuming various kinds of jujube preparations. I, Sāriputta, have personally experienced living on a single jujube fruit as food. One might think: 'At that time, the jujube fruit must have been large.' But this is not the case, Sāriputta. Even then, the jujube fruit was the same size as it is now. Due to eating only a single jujube fruit, my body became extremely emaciated. My limbs and body parts became like the dried, worn-out branches of an old tree. My buttocks stuck out like a post, and my ribs jutted out like the rafters of an old shed. My eyes sank deep into their sockets, like the shimmer of water in a deep well. The skin of my head shriveled and cracked like a bitter gourd plucked when unripe and dried by the wind and sun. When I tried to touch the skin of my belly, I would grasp my backbone. When I tried to touch my backbone, I would grasp the skin of my belly. My belly skin stuck to my backbone due to lack of food. When I needed to defecate or urinate, I would just collapse right there due to weakness. While trying to comfort my body by massaging my limbs with my hands, the hair would fall from my body due to lack of nourishment.\n\nThere are, Sāriputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold the view and say: 'Purification is achieved by food.' They say: 'We sustain ourselves on mung beans, on sesame seeds, on rice grains.' They eat rice grains, rice flour, and drink rice water — consuming rice in various forms. I, Sāriputta, have personally experienced living on a single rice grain as food. One might think: 'At that time, the rice grain must have been large.' But this is not the case, Sāriputta. Even then, the rice grain was the same size as it is now. Due to eating only a single rice grain, my body became extremely emaciated. My limbs and body parts became like the dried, worn-out branches of an old tree. My buttocks stuck out like a post, and my ribs jutted out like the rafters of an old shed. My eyes sank deep into their sockets, like the shimmer of water in a deep well. The skin of my head shriveled and cracked like a bitter gourd plucked when unripe and dried by the wind and sun. When I tried to touch the skin of my belly, I would grasp my backbone. When I tried to touch my backbone, I would grasp the skin of my belly. My belly skin stuck to my backbone due to lack of food. When I needed to defecate or urinate, I would just collapse right there due to weakness. While trying to comfort my body by massaging my limbs with my hands, the hairs would fall from my body due to lack of nourishment.\n\nEven with that conduct, that practice, those austerities, I did not attain higher human states or the noble wisdom and vision of excellence. Why is that? Because I did not attain the noble wisdom, the noble wisdom which, when attained, leads the doer rightly to the ending of suffering.\n\nThere are, Sāriputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through passing from one state of existence to another.' However, in the cycle of rebirths, Sāriputta, it is not easy to find a realm that I have not already passed through in this long journey, except among the gods of the Pure Abodes. And if I were to pass on to be born among the gods in the Pure Abodes, Sāriputta, I would not return again to this world.\n\nThere are, Sāriputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through some particular kind of rebirth.' However, it is not easy to find a kind of rebirth that I have not already undergone in this long journey, except among the gods of the Pure Abodes. And if I were to be reborn among the gods in the Pure Abodes, Sāriputta, I would not return again to this world.\n\nThere are, Sāriputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through some particular abode.' However, it is not easy to find an abode that I have not already dwelled in during this long journey, except among the gods of the Pure Abodes. And if I were to dwell among the gods in the Pure Abodes, Sāriputta, I would not return again to this world.\n\nThere are, Sāriputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through sacrifices.' However, it is not easy to find a sacrifice that I have not already performed in this long journey, Sāriputta, especially one conducted by a king, a noble warrior chieftain, or a wealthy brahmin.\n\nThere are, Sāriputta, some ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'Purification comes about through worshipping fire.' However, it is not easy to find a fire worship that I have not already practiced in this long journey, Sāriputta, especially one conducted by a king, a noble warrior chieftain, or a wealthy brahmin.\n\nSāriputta, there are certain ascetics and brahmins who hold this view and say: 'As long as a person is young, youthful, with black hair, endowed with the blessings of youth, and in the prime of life, he is endowed with the highest lucidity of wisdom. But when this person becomes old, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, he declines from that lucidity of wisdom.' But it should not be seen like this, Sāriputta. I, Sāriputta, am now old, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, being eighty years old. Here, Sāriputta, I have four disciples who live for a hundred years, endowed with the highest mindfulness, retention, persistence, and lucidity of wisdom. Just as, Sāriputta, a strong archer, trained, practiced, experienced, with little difficulty could shoot an arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, so too, with such highest mindfulness, retention, persistence, and lucidity of wisdom, they might repeatedly ask me questions about the four foundations of mindfulness. Each time they asked, I would answer, and having answered, they would remember my answers and would not ask again about what had been answered. Except when eating, drinking, chewing, or savoring food, performing bodily functions, or resting to dispel fatigue, the Tathāgata's teaching of the Dhamma would remain uninterrupted, as would the Tathāgata's speech on the Dhamma and responses to questions. Even if these four disciples, who live for a hundred years, were to attend to me on a stretcher after a hundred years pass, there would be no change in the lucidity of the Tathāgata's wisdom.\n\nTherefore, Sāriputta, when one speaks rightly, one should say: 'A being who is free from delusion has arisen in the world for the benefit and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, benefit, and happiness of gods and humans.' This is how one should speak, Sāriputta.\n\nAt that time, the Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him. Then the Venerable Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! As I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma, the hairs of my body stood up. Venerable sir, what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma?\"\n\n\"As to that, Nāgasamāla, you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as 'The hair raising discourse.'\"\n\nThus the Blessed One spoke. The Venerable Nāgasamāla was satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Bodhi tree, having just attained full awakening. Then, for seven days, the Blessed One sat in one posture experiencing the bliss of liberation. At the end of those seven days, the Blessed One, emerging from that stillness of mind, during the last watch of the night, thoroughly paid attention to dependent co-arising in both forward and reverse order:\n\nThis being, that becomes; from the arising of this, that arises. That is: from ignorance as a condition, formations arise; from formations as a condition, consciousness arises; from consciousness as a condition, name-and-form arises; from name-and-form as a condition, the six sense bases arise; from the six sense bases as a condition, contact arises; from contact as a condition, feeling arises; from feeling as a condition, craving arises; from craving as a condition, clinging arises; from clinging as a condition, continued existence comes to be; from continued existence as a condition, birth comes to be; from birth as a condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.\n\nBut with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form cease; with the cessation of name-and-form, the six sense bases cease; with the cessation of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases; with the cessation of becoming, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus, there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.\n\nKnowing this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:\n\n\"When the nature of things becomes evident,\nto the Brahmin meditating with continuous effort;\nHe persists dispelling Māra's army,\nas the sun illuminating the sky."}]}

Then, while the venerable Soṇa was alone in seclusion, the following thought arose in his mind: \"Indeed, all the Blessed One's disciples who live with energy aroused are like me. Yet my mind is not released from the defilements without clinging. I have wealth in my family; it is possible to enjoy the wealth and to do meritorious deeds. What if I were to abandon the training, return to the lay life, enjoy wealth, and do meritorious deeds?\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, knowing the thought in the venerable Soṇa's mind — as easily as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm — disappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain and appeared in front of the venerable Soṇa in the Cool Grove. The Blessed One sat down on a prepared seat. The venerable Soṇa paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.\n\nThe Blessed One said to the venerable Soṇa: \"Soṇa, when you were alone in seclusion, did this thought arise in your mind: 'Indeed, all the Blessed One's disciples who live with aroused energy are like me. Yet my mind is not released from the defilements without clinging. I have wealth in my family; it is possible to enjoy the wealth and to do meritorious deeds. What if I were to abandon the training, return to the lay life, enjoy wealth, and do meritorious deeds?'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Soṇa, were you not skilled in playing the lute (sitār) when you were a householder?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Soṇa, when the strings of your lute were too tight, was your lute at that time harmonious and playable?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Soṇa, when the strings of your lute were too loose, was your lute at that time harmonious and playable?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"But when the strings of your lute were neither too tight nor too loose but tuned to the middle pitch, was your lute then harmonious and playable?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Similarly, Soṇa, excessive energy leads to restlessness, and too little energy leads to laziness. Therefore, Soṇa, resolve on balanced energy, break through to a balanced state of the faculties, and pay attention to that sign.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the venerable Soṇa replied.\n\nThen the Blessed One, having instructed the venerable Soṇa with this advice — as easily as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm — disappeared from the Cool Grove and appeared on Vulture Peak Mountain.\n\nThen the venerable Soṇa, after a while, resolved on balanced energy, had a break through to a balanced state of the faculties, and paid attention to that sign. Then the venerable Soṇa, living alone, diligent, with continuous effort, and resolute, soon realized for himself, through direct knowledge, that ultimate goal of the spiritual life for which sons of good families rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, knowing and realizing it for himself, he abided in it.\n\nHe directly knew: \"Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\" And the venerable Soṇa became one of the arahants.\n\nThen the venerable Soṇa, having attained arahantship, thought: \"Let me now approach the Blessed One and declare my attainment of arahantship.\" Then the venerable Soṇa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the venerable Soṇa said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, the bhikkhu who is an arahant, whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge, is established in six things — he is established in renunciation (giving up of sensual pleasures), established in seclusion, established in harmlessness, established in non-craving, established in non-clinging, and established in non-delusion (fully aware with mental clarity and unconfused, established in close examination and verification).\n\nThere might be, however, venerable sir, for some venerable one, this thought: 'This venerable one is established in renunciation only on account of mere faith.' Indeed, venerable sir, this should not be viewed thus. The bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, seeing no more duties of his own or any accumulation of the done, due to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, is established in renunciation; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, is established in renunciation; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, is established in renunciation.\n\nThere might be, however, venerable sir, for some venerable one, this thought: 'This venerable one is established in seclusion only for the sake of gain, honor, and fame.' Indeed, venerable sir, this should not be viewed thus. The bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, seeing no more duties of his own or any accumulation of the done, due to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, is established in seclusion; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, is established in seclusion; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, is established in seclusion.\n\nThere might be, however, venerable sir, for some venerable one, this thought: 'This venerable one is established in harmlessness only due to attachment to rules and observances.' Indeed, venerable sir, this should not be viewed thus. The bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, seeing no more duties of his own or any accumulation of the done, due to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, is established in harmlessness; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, is established in harmlessness; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, is established in harmlessness.\n\nDue to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, one is established in non-craving; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, one is established in non-craving; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, one is established in non-craving.\n\nDue to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, one is established in non-clinging; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, one is established in non-clinging; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, one is established in non-clinging.\n\nDue to the wearing away of passion, being free of passion, one is established in non-delusion; due to the wearing away of aversion, being free of aversion, one is established in non-delusion; due to the wearing away of delusion, being free of delusion, one is established in non-delusion.\n\nThus, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu whose mind is rightly liberated, even if many forms cognizable by the eye come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena. Even if many sounds cognizable by the ear, odors cognizable by the nose, tastes cognizable by the tongue, tactile objects cognizable by the body, or mental phenomena (ideas, feelings, thoughts) cognizable by the mind come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena.\n\nJust as, venerable sir, a solid rock mountain, unbroken and without hollows, one solid mass, would not be shaken, disturbed, or cause to tremble by a heavy storm of wind and rain coming from the east, the west, the north, or the south;\n\nJust so, venerable sir, for a bhikkhu whose mind is rightly liberated, even if many forms cognizable by the eye come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena. Even if many sounds cognizable by the ear, odors cognizable by the nose, tastes cognizable by the tongue, tactile objects cognizable by the body, or mental phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range, they do not take hold of his mind. His mind remains detached, steady, and in equipoise, seeing the impermanence of all phenomena.\n\nFor one established in renunciation,\nand the seclusion of mind;\nestablished in non-ill will,\nand the destruction of clinging.\n\nFor one established in the wearing away of craving,\nand non-delusion of mind;\nSeeing the arising of phenomena,\nthe mind is rightly liberated.\n\nFor him rightly liberated,\nthe bhikkhu with a peaceful mind;\nThere is no accumulation of deeds,\nand no more tasks remain to be done.\n\nJust as a solid rock,\nis not shaken by the wind;\nSo forms, tastes, sounds,\nodors, and tactile sensations, all.\n\nDesirable and undesirable phenomena,\ndo not disturb one who is such;\nThe steady mind, fully liberated,\nsees the impermanence of all."}]}

Which five? The faculty of confidence (faith), persistence (energy), mindfulness, collectedness (samādhi) and wisdom.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of confidence (faith)? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones has confidence, is convinced in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata, acknowledging: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant and perfectly awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide for trainable individuals, a teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called the faculty of confidence.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of energy? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for the giving up of unwholesome mental qualities and for the cultivation of wholesome mental qualities. With steadfast determination and unwavering effort, he generates desire, strives, arouses persistence, comprehends with his mind, and makes an effort, both to prevent the arising of unarisen harmful unwholesome mental qualities and to abandon existing ones, and to bring forth and develop unarisen wholesome mental qualities and enhance those that have arisen. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of energy.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of mindfulness? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is fully attentive, equipped with utmost mindfulness, able to recall and reflect upon things done and said long ago. He practices by observing the body in and of itself, ardently, with full awareness and mindfulness, having put away craving and aversion with regard to the world. Similarly, he applies this practice to feelings, mind, and mental qualities, dwelling as an observer who fully understands and remains mindful, eradicating worldly desires and dissatisfaction. This is called the faculty of mindfulness.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of collectedness (samādhi)? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones, having made letting go his basis, attains stability of mind, attains unification of mind. Having secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental qualities, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which includes reflection and examination (of thoughts), born of seclusion, filled with rapture (joy) and pleasure. With the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which is devoid of reflection and examination, and has rapture (joy) and pleasure born of a stable mind. With the fading of rapture, he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware, experiencing pleasure with the body, which the noble ones declare, 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful' - he enters and dwells in the third jhāna. With the letting go of pleasure and pain, and the disappearance of previous joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, characterized by neither pain nor pleasure, which possesses purification of awareness by equanimity. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of collectedness.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the faculty of wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is wise, endowed with the wisdom that understands the arising and passing away of phenomena, a wisdom that is noble and penetrative, and leads directly to the cessation of suffering. Such a disciple truly understands, 'This is suffering', 'This is the origin of suffering', 'This is the cessation of suffering', and 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering'. This is called the faculty of wisdom.\n\nThese, bhikkhus, are the five faculties.\""}]}

There, he addressed the bhikkhus thus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" they replied. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Bhikkhus, do you recall the five lower fetters as I have taught them?\"\n\nWhen this was said, Venerable Mālukyaputta responded to the Blessed One: \"Indeed, venerable sir, I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One.\"\n\n\"How exactly do you remember the five lower fetters as I have taught them, Mālukyaputta?\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, I recall the following as lower fetters taught by the Blessed One: identity-view, doubt (wrt teachings), adherence to rites and rituals, sensual desire, and ill-will. This is how I remember the five lower fetters, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Mālukyaputta, for what reason do you say that I taught these five lower fetters in this way? Surely, Mālukyaputta, the wanderers of other sects might use the simile of an infant to challenge you. For a young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'self', so how could the view of identity arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards identity-view is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'teachings', so how could doubt about teachings arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards doubt is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'ethics', so how could adherance to rites and rituals arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards such attachment is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'sensual pleasures', so how could sensual desire arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards sensual desire is present within him. A young, tender infant lying on his back does not even have the concept of 'beings', so how could ill-will towards beings arise in him? Yet, the latent tendency towards ill-will is present within him. Wouldn't the wanderers of other sects use this simile of the infant to challenge you?\"\n\nAfter this was said, Venerable Ānanda addressed the Blessed One: \"It is time, Blessed One, it is time, Well-Gone One, for you to teach the five lower fetters. Upon hearing them from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember.\"\n\n\"Therefore, Ānanda, listen carefully and pay close attention; I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" replied Venerable Ānanda. The Blessed One then spoke:\n\n\"Here, Ānanda, an uninstructed ordinary person, who does not regard noble ones and is unskilled and untrained in their Dhamma, who does not regard virtuous people and is unskilled and untrained in their Dhamma, remains entangled and afflicted by identity view; and does not truly understand the escape from arisen identity view. For him, this identity view has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by doubt; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen doubt. This doubt has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by adherance to rites and rituals; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen adherance to rites and rituals. This attachment has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by sensual desire; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen sensual desire. This sensual desire has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nHe remains entangled and afflicted by ill-will; and he does not truly know the escape from arisen ill-will. This ill-will has become deep-rooted and is a lower fetter.\n\nMoreover, Ānanda, a disciple of the noble ones, who respects the noble ones and is skilled and well-trained in their Dhamma, who respects virtuous people and is skilled and well-trained in their Dhamma, does not remain entangled or afflicted by identity view; he truly understands the escape from any arisen identity view. For him, that identity view and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by doubt; he truly understands the escape from any arisen doubt. For him, that doubt and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by adherance to rites and rituals; he truly understands the escape from any arisen adherance to rites and rituals. For him, that attachment and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by sensual desire; he truly understands the escape from any arisen sensual desire. For him, that sensual desire and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nHe does not remain entangled or afflicted by ill-will; he truly understands the escape from any arisen ill-will. For him, that ill-will and its underlying tendency are abandoned.\n\nĀnanda, there is a path and a way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters. That one could understand, see, or abandon these five lower fetters without following this path and way of practice — this is not possible. Just as it is impossible to cut out the heartwood of a large, solid tree standing with heartwood without first cutting through its bark and sapwood, similarly, it is not possible to abandon the five lower fetters without adhering to the correct path and way of practice.\n\nFurthermore, Ānanda, there is indeed a path and a way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters; that one, by following this path and way of practice, can understand, see, or abandon these five lower fetters — this possibility does exist.\n\nJust as, Ānanda, it is indeed possible for someone to cut through the core of a great tree endowed with heartwood by first slicing through its bark and sapwood, similarly, Ānanda, it is indeed possible for one to understand, see, and abandon the five lower fetters by adhering to the correct path and way of practice. Just as, Ānanda, the Ganges River, full and overflowing, is impassable in its breadth by a frail person who thinks, 'I will cross this breadth of the Ganges River by cutting through the current safely to the other side'; such a person would not be able to cut through the current and reach the far shore safely. In the same way, Ānanda, for those whose minds do not leap forward, become confident, steady, and free when teachings leading to the cessation of identity-view are given, they should be seen as frail like that person. Just as, Ānanda, the Ganges River, full and deep, could be crossed by a strong person who thinks, 'I will cut through the current of this river and safely reach the other side'; such a person would be able to cut through the current and safely reach the far shore.\n\nSimilarly, Ānanda, for those whose minds do leap forward, become confident, steady, and free when teachings leading to the cessation of identity-view are given, they should be viewed as strong like that person.\n\nAnd what, Ānanda, is the path, what is the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu, through solitude from attachments and by abandoning unwholesome mental qualities, with the complete internal stilling of bodily agitation, secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental qualities, enters and dwells in the first jhāna. This jhāna is characterized by reflection and examination of thoughts, and is filled with joy (rapture) and pleasure that are born from seclusion. In this state, he perceives whatever phenomena are present — whether form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness — as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that world. This indeed, Ānanda, is the path, the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters.\n\nFurthermore, Ānanda, the bhikkhu, upon the subsiding of reflection and examination of thoughts, enters and dwells in the second jhāna … continues to the third jhāna … and then enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna. In these states, whatever phenomena are present — whether form, feeling, perception, volitions, or consciousness — he perceives as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a boil, a dart, misery, an affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and not-self. He turns his mind away from these phenomena. Having turned his mind away, he directs it towards the deathless element, reflecting: 'This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the wearing away of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.' If he is steady in that state, he experiences the wearing away of the taints. But if he does not experience the wearing away of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the wearing away of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes, and there he will attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that world. This indeed, Ānanda, is the path, the way of practice for the abandonment of the five lower fetters.\n\nFurthermore, Ānanda, a bhikkhu, by completely surpassing perceptions of form, with the disappearance of recognition of sense impressions and by not attending to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and dwells in the base of infinite space.

The Tathāgata sees this: 'Such is form, its arising, its passing away; such is feeling, its arising, its passing away; such is perception, its arising, its passing away; such are volitional formations, their arising, their passing away; such is consciousness, its arising, its passing away.' Therefore, I say, the Tathāgata, through giving up of all conceptions, all mental disturbance, all I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendencies to conceit and through the exhaustion, fading away, cessation, relinquishment, is liberated without clinging.\"\n\n\"Being thus liberated, Venerable Gotama, where does a bhikkhu reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'reappear' does not apply.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, does he not reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'does not reappear' also does not apply.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, does he both reappear and not reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\n\"Then, Venerable Gotama, does he neither reappear nor not reappear?\"\n\n\"Vaccha, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\n\"When asked, 'Being thus liberated in mind, Venerable Gotama, where does a bhikkhu reappear?' you replied, 'Vaccha, 'reappears' does not apply.' When further asked, 'Then, does he not reappear?' you replied, 'Vaccha, 'does not reappear' does not apply.' When further asked if 'he both reappears and does not reappear,' you stated, 'Vaccha, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply.' And when asked whether 'he neither reappears nor does not reappear,' you replied, 'Vaccha, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.' At this, I have fallen into confusion, Venerable Gotama. Even the slight confidence I had from our earlier conversation has now disappeared.\"\n\n\"It is fitting for you, Vaccha, to be confused. This Dhamma, Vaccha, is profound, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, understandable only by the wise. It is difficult for you to understand this, being of another view, another faith, another inclination, following a different teacher.\n\nSo, Vaccha, let me question you instead; answer as you see fit.\n\n### Simile of Fire\n\nWhat do you think, Vaccha, if a fire were burning in front of you, would you know, 'This fire is burning in front of me'?\"\n\n\"If there were a fire burning in front of me, Venerable Gotama, I would know, 'This fire is burning in front of me.'\"\n\n\"And if someone were to ask you, 'This fire burning in front of you, on what does it depend?' how would you answer?\"\n\n\"If, Venerable Gotama, you were to ask me thus:\n\n'This fire burning before you, on what does it depend to burn?' thus questioned, I, Venerable Gotama, would answer: 'This fire burning before me depends on grass and wood as fuel to burn.'\"\n\n\"If that fire in front of you were to be extinguished, Vaccha, would you know, 'This fire in front of me has been extinguished'?\"\n\n\"If that fire in front of me were to be extinguished, Venerable Gotama, I would know, 'This fire in front of me has been extinguished.'\"\n\n\"And if someone were to ask you, 'This fire that has been extinguished, in which direction has it gone — east, south, west, or north?' how would you respond?\"\n\n\"It does not apply, Venerable Gotama. For that fire, having burned dependent on grass and wood for fuel, being consumed, and not being offered any more fuel, is said to be extinguished.\"\n\n### Freed from Classification\n\n\"In the same way, Vaccha, whatever form by which one might define the Tathāgata, that form has been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by form, Vaccha, the Tathāgata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\nWhatever feeling by which one might designate the Tathāgata, that feeling has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so it is no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by feeling, Vaccha, the Tathāgata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply. Whatever perception by which one might designate the Tathāgata, that perception has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so it is no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by perception, Vaccha, the Tathāgata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply. Whatever volitional formations by which one might designate the Tathāgata, those volitional formations have been abandoned by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so they are no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by volitional formations, Vaccha, the Tathāgata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply. Whatever consciousness by which one might designate the Tathāgata, that consciousness has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, so it is no longer subject to future arising. Freed from the classification by consciousness, Vaccha, the Tathāgata is profound, immeasurable, hard to fathom, like the great ocean. 'Reappears' does not apply, 'does not reappear' does not apply, 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply, 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply.\"\n\nAfter these words were spoken, the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One:\n\n\"Just as, Venerable Gotama, near a village or town, there stands a great sal tree. Its branches and leaves fall off, its bark peels away, and its sapwood disintegrates. In time, it stands clean, devoid of branches, bark, and sapwood, established in its heartwood. Similarly, the teaching of Venerable Gotama stands purified, free of branches, bark, and sapwood, established in its essence.\n\nMarvelous, Venerable Gotama! Allow me to take refuge in Venerable Gotama from this day forth as long as life lasts, having gone to him for refuge.\""}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:\n\n### Not Eating At Night\n\n\"Bhikkhus, I eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By not eating at night, I experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Therefore, bhikkhus, you too should eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By not eating at night, you will experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One.\n\nThen, while wandering in stages through the Kāsī region, the Blessed One arrived at a Kāsī town of Kīṭāgiri. There, the Blessed One stayed in this Kāsī town, Kīṭāgiri.\n\nAt that time, a group of bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri. Then, several bhikkhus went to visit these bhikkhus and said to them: \"Friends, the Blessed One eats only during the day, without having a meal at night, and the bhikkhu saṅgha does the same. By not eating at night, they experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Therefore, friends, you too should eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By doing so, you will experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.\"\n\nWhen this was said, the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka said to those bhikkhus: \"Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside of the proper time. By eating in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time, we experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Why should we abandon what is evident and pursue what is uncertain? We will continue to eat in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time.\"\n\nWhen the bhikkhus were unable to convince the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, they went to the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, we went to the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka; having approached, we said to them: 'Friends, the Blessed One only eats during the day, without having a meal at night, and the bhikkhu saṅgha does the same; by not eating at night, they experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Therefore, friends, you too should abstain from eating at night. By so doing, you too will experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.' When this was said, venerable sir, the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka said to us: 'Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside of the proper time. By eating in the evening, morning, and during the day, we experience fewer ailments and illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Why should we abandon what is evident and pursue what is uncertain? We will continue to eat in the evening, morning, and during the day.' Since we could not convince the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, venerable sir, we have come to inform the Blessed One of this matter.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: \"Come, bhikkhu, in my name, call the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, saying: 'The teacher calls you, venerables.'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu replied. Then that bhikkhu, having answered the Blessed One, approached the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka; having approached them, he said, \"The teacher calls you, venerables.\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka replied to that bhikkhu, and they approached the Blessed One; having approached and paid homage to the Blessed One, they sat down to one side. After they sat to one side, the Blessed One said this:\n\n\"Is it true, bhikkhus, that several bhikkhus approached you and said: 'The Blessed One and the community of bhikkhus eat only during the day, without having a meal at night; by not eating at night, they experience fewer ailments, fewer illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Come, friends, you too should eat only during the day, without having a meal at night. By not eating at night, you too will experience fewer ailments, fewer illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living.' And when this was said, bhikkhus, did you respond to those bhikkhus: 'Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside of the proper time. By eating in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time, we experience fewer ailments, fewer illnesses, nimbleness, strength, and ease of living. Why should we abandon what is evident and pursue what is uncertain? We will continue to eat in the evening, morning, and during the day outside of the proper time.'\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n### Feelings and Unwholesome and Wholesome States\n\n\"Bhikkhus, do you understand me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this: 'Whatever this person experiences, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Surely, bhikkhus, do you understand the Dhamma as I have taught it: that in the case of some person, experiencing a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish; but in the case of another person, experiencing a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase. In the case of some person, experiencing a painful feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish; but in the case of another person, experiencing a painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase. In the case of some person, experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish; but in the case of another person, experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase?\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir.\"\n\n#### Pleasant Feelings\n\n\"Good, bhikkhus. And if it were unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom thus: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say: 'Abandon such a pleasant feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' therefore I say, 'Abandon such a pleasant feeling.' If it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Dwell experiencing such a pleasant feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' therefore I say, 'Dwell experiencing such a pleasant feeling.'\n\n#### Painful Feelings\n\nIf it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Abandon such a painful feeling'?\"\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' therefore I say, 'Abandon such a painful feeling.' If it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Dwell experiencing such a painful feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' therefore I say, 'Dwell experiencing such a painful feeling.'\n\n#### Neither-Painful-Nor-Pleasant Feelings\n\nIf it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Abandon such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling'?”\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish,' therefore I say, 'Abandon such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.' If it had been unknown to me, unseen, not understood, not realized, or not contacted through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' would it be appropriate for me, not knowing that, to say, 'Dwell experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling'?\"\n\n\"No, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, because this has been known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by me through wisdom: 'Here, for some person, experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase,' therefore I say, 'Dwell experiencing such a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'\n\nBhikkhus, I do not say to all bhikkhus, 'You must act with diligence'; nor do I say to all bhikkhus, 'You must not act with diligence.' Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are arahants, whose taints are exhausted, who have lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, exhausted the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, I do not say to such bhikkhus, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because their diligence has been accomplished. They are incapable of negligence.\n\nBut, bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are trainees, not yet attained to their goal, but who are striving for the unsurpassed safety from bondage, to such bhikkhus I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, it is possible that by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing their faculties, those venerable ones might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with their own direct knowledge, they might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for these bhikkhus, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\"\n\n### Seven Kinds of Persons\n\n\"Bhikkhus, there are seven kinds of persons to be found existing in the world. What seven? They are: one liberated both ways, one liberated by wisdom, a body-witness, one attained through view, one attained through confidence, a Dhamma-follower, and a faith-follower.\n\n#### 1. Liberated Both Ways\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of a person is one liberated both ways? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person contacts with the body and dwells in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, and by having seen with wisdom, his taints are exhausted. This kind of a person is called one liberated both ways. For such a bhikkhu, I do not say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because his diligence has been accomplished. He is incapable of negligence.\n\n#### 2. Liberated by Wisdom\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is one liberated by wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms; however, having seen with wisdom, his taints are exhausted. This person is called one liberated by wisdom. For this bhikkhu too, I do not say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because his diligence has been accomplished. He is incapable of negligence.\n\n#### 3. Body-Witness\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is a body-witness? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person contacts with the body and dwells in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, and by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted. This person is called a body-witness. For this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\"\n\n#### 4. Attained Through View\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is one attained through view? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, but by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted, and the teachings proclaimed by the Tathāgata are understood and practiced by him with wisdom. This person is called one attained through view. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n#### 5. Attained Through Confidence\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is one attained through confidence? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, but by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted, and his confidence in the Tathāgata is deeply rooted and well-established. This person is called one attained through confidence. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n#### 6. A Dhamma-Follower\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is a Dhamma-follower? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms, but by having seen with wisdom, some of his taints are exhausted, and the teachings proclaimed by the Tathāgata are understood and practiced by him with wisdom to some extent. Moreover, he possesses the faculties of confidence, persistence (energy), mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. This person is called a Dhamma-follower. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n#### 7. A Faith-Follower\n\nBhikkhus, what kind of person is a faith-follower? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not contact with the body and dwell in those liberations that are peaceful and formless, surpassing forms. By having seen with wisdom, his taints are not exhausted, and he has mere faith and love for the Tathāgata. Moreover, he possesses the faculties of confidence, persistence, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. This person is called a faith-follower. For this bhikkhu too, I say, 'You must act with diligence.' Why is that? Because it is possible that this venerable one, by resorting to appropriate dwelling places, associating with good friends, and balancing his faculties, might realize here and now the highest culmination of the spiritual life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having realized it with his own direct knowledge, he might dwell in it. Seeing the fruit of diligence for this bhikkhu, I say, 'You must act with diligence.'\n\n### Final Knowledge Is Attained Gradually\n\nBhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is attained immediately at the first attempt. However, bhikkhus, it is through gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress that final knowledge is attained.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, is final knowledge attained through gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress? Here, bhikkhus, someone who has faith approaches [a teacher]; having approached, he attends on [the teacher]; attending on him, he lends ear; having lent ear, he hears the Dhamma; having heard the Dhamma, he remembers (memorizes) it; he examines the meaning of the teachings he has remembered; when he examines their meaning, he gains a reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained reflective acceptance of those teachings, aspiration (interest/desire/zeal) springs up in him; when aspiration has sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his will, he scrutinizes; having scrutinized, he strives; resolutely striving, he realizes with the body the ultimate truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.\n\nThere has not been that faith, bhikkhus, and there has not been that approaching, and there has not been that attending, and there has not been that lending ear, and there has not been that hearing of the Dhamma, and there has not been that remembering of the Dhamma, and there has not been that examination of the meaning, and there has not been that reflective acceptance of the teachings, and there has not been that aspiration, and there has not been that application of will, and there has not been that scrutiny, and there has not been that striving. Bhikkhus, you have lost your way; bhikkhus, you have been practising the wrong way. Just how far, bhikkhus, have these misguided men strayed from this teaching and training.\n\nBhikkhus, there is a four-phrased statement, and when it is understood, a wise person would quickly comprehend its meaning. Shall I declare it to you, bhikkhus, so you can understand it?\"\n\n\"And who are we, venerable sir, that we should understand the Dhamma?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, even with a teacher who is concerned with worldly things, inheritor of worldly things, involved with worldly things, such haggling by his disciples would not be proper: 'If it were like this for us, then we would do it; if it were not like this for us, then we would not do it'; how much more so when the teacher is the Tathāgata, who dwells completely detached from worldly things?\n\n\"Bhikkhus, for a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, it is natural that he conduct himself thus: 'The Blessed One is the Teacher, I am a disciple; the Blessed One knows, I do not know.' For a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, the Teacher's instruction becomes nourishing and is suitable for growth. Furthermore, for a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, it is natural that he conduct himself thus: 'Even if my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and my flesh and blood dry up, I will not let the energy for striving stop until I have attained what can be attained by human strength, human energy, and human persistence.' Bhikkhus, for a faithful disciple who is intent on deeply penetrating the Teacher's teaching, one of two fruits is to be expected: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a trace of clinging left, the state of non-returning.\n\nThe Blessed One said this. The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

What are these five? (1) The state 'do not grow old' when subject to aging is unobtainable by an ascetic, a brahmin, a deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world. (2) The state 'do not fall ill' when subject to illness ... (3) 'do not die' when subject to death ... (4) 'do not perish' when subject to perishing ... (5) 'do not be lost' when subject to loss is unobtainable by an ascetic, a brahmin, a deity, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone else in the world.\n\n(1) Bhikkhus, for an uninstructed ordinary person, what is subject to aging inevitably ages (grows old). When this occurs, he does not reflect thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to aging ages. For all beings that cycle through coming and going, passing away, and rebirth, what is subject to aging ages. If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to old age grows old, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would not be able to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he grieves, grows weary, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes disoriented. This is called an uninstructed ordinary person pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow, who only torments himself.\n\n(2) Again, for the uninstructed ordinary person, what is subject to illness falls ill … (3) … what is subject to death dies … (4) … what is subject to perishing perishes … (5) … what is subject to loss is lost. When this occurs, he does not reflect thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to loss is lost. For all beings that cycle through coming and going, passing away, and rebirth, what is subject to aging grows old. If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to loss is lost, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would not be able to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he grieves, grows weary, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes disoriented. This is called an uninstructed ordinary person pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow, who only torments himself.\n\n(1) Bhikkhus, for a learned disciple of the noble ones, what is subject to aging inevitably ages (grows old). When this occurs, he reflects thus: 'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to aging ages. For all beings that cycle through coming and going, passing away, and rebirth, what is subject to aging ages. If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to old age grows old, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would not be able to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he does not grieve, he does not grow weary, does not lament, does not weep beating his breast and does not become disoriented. This is said, bhikkhus: 'A learned disciple of the noble ones who has extracted the poisonous dart of sorrow with which the uninstructed ordinary person pierces and torments himself. He, free from sorrow and without a dart, personally attains complete Nibbāna.'\n\n(2) Furthermore, bhikkhus, for the learned disciple of the noble ones, what is subject to illness becomes ill... (3) what is subject to death dies... (4) what is subject to perishing perishes... (5) what is subject to loss is lost. When this occurs, he reflects thus: 'It is not only I who lose what is subject to loss. Indeed, for all beings that cycle through coming and going, passing away, and rebirth, what is subject to loss is lost by all. If I were to grieve, grow weary, lament, weep beating my breast, and become disoriented when what is subject to loss is lost, my food would not satisfy me, my appearance would deteriorate, I would be unable to carry out my tasks, my enemies would be delighted, and my friends would be disheartened.' Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he does not grieve, does not grow weary, does not lament, does not weep beating his breast, and does not become disoriented. This is said, bhikkhus: 'A learned disciple of the noble ones who has removed the poisonous dart of sorrow, with which the uninstructed ordinary person pierces and torments himself.

This is the first stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.\n\nFurther again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the teachings of the Buddha — Indeed, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, leading onward, to be personally experienced by the wise. This is the second stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.\n\nFurther again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha — Indeed, the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the knowledgeable way, practicing the proper way; these are the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals: this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. This is the third stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.\n\nFurther again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones lives at home with a mind free from the stain of stinginess, generous, open-handed, enjoying relinquishment, responsive to requests, and joyful in sharing gifts. This is the fourth stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.\n\nThese indeed, bhikkhus, are the four streams of merit, outflows of good, and supports for ease.\""}]}

Then Dīghāvu addressed his father, the householder Jotika, saying, \"Please, householder, go to the Blessed One, and in my name, bow down with your head at his feet and say: 'Venerable sir, Dīghāvu, the lay follower, is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. He bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet.' And also say, 'It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would come to the dwelling of Dīghāvu the lay follower, out of compassion.'\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" replied the householder Jotika to Dīghāvu the lay follower, and he went to the Blessed One. Having approached, he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side. Sitting there, the householder Jotika addressed the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, Dīghāvu, the lay follower, is sick, experiencing pain, and gravely ill. He bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet. And he also says, 'It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would come to the dwelling of Dīghāvu the lay follower, out of compassion.'\" The Blessed One consented in silence.\n\nThen the Blessed One, after putting on his robe and taking his bowl and outer robe, went to the dwelling of Dīghāvu the lay follower. Having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat. Sitting there, the Blessed One addressed Dīghāvu the lay follower: \"Is it bearable for you, Dīghāvu? Is it manageable for you? Are your painful feelings decreasing, not increasing? Is their subsiding, not their intensifying, discernible?\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, it is not bearable for me, it is not manageable for me. My painful feelings are increasing, not decreasing. Their intensifying, not their subsiding, is discernible.\"\n\n\"Therefore, Dīghāvu, you should train yourself thus: 'I will be endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha — thus indeed is the Blessed One: an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One. I will be endowed with experiential confidence in the Dhamma... I will be endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha... I will be endowed with the virtues loved by the noble ones — unbroken, unblemished, unspotted, untarnished, leading to collectedness.' Thus should you train yourself, Dīghāvu.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, the four factors of stream-entry taught by the Blessed One are found in me, and I am found among them. Venerable sir, I am endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha — thus indeed is the Blessed One: an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be trained, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One. I am endowed with experiential confidence in the Dhamma... I am endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha... I am endowed with the virtues loved by the noble ones — unbroken, unblemished, unspotted, untarnished, leading to collectedness.\"\n\n\"Therefore, Dīghāvu, based on these four factors of stream-entry, you should further develop the six factors conducive to true knowledge. Here, Dīghāvu, you should dwell contemplating impermanence in all conditions, perceiving discontentment in what is impermanent, perceiving non-self in what is discontented, perceiving abandoning, perceiving dispassion, and perceiving ending. Thus should you train yourself, Dīghāvu.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, the six factors conducive to true knowledge taught by the Blessed One are found in me, and I am found among them. Venerable sir, I dwell contemplating impermanence in all conditions, perceiving discontentment in what is impermanent, perceiving non-self in what is discontented, perceiving abandoning, perceiving dispassion, and perceiving ending.\"\n\n\"However, venerable sir, it occurs to me: 'Let not the householder Jotika fall into grief upon my passing.'\" \"Do not think that way, dear Dīghāvu. Rather, remember what I have taught you, and focus your mind on it well.\"\n\nThen the Blessed One, having given this exhortation to Dīghāvu the lay follower, rose from his seat and departed. Soon after the Blessed One had left, Dīghāvu the lay follower passed away. Then several bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, bowed down to him, and sat to one side. Sitting there, the bhikkhus addressed the Blessed One:\n\n\"Venerable sir, the lay follower named Dīghāvu, who was exhorted by the Blessed One with a brief exhortation, has passed away. What is his destination, what is his future state?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, Dīghāvu the lay follower was wise. He practiced in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me with technical points about the teaching. By the destruction of the five lower fetters, Dīghāvu the lay follower has been reborn spontaneously and will attain final Nibbāna there, without ever returning to this world.\"\n\nThis is the third."}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the group of five bhikkhus:\n\n\"Bhikkhus, two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth. Which two? That which is pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures, which is low, vulgar, common, ignoble, and unbeneficial; and that which is pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. Avoiding both these extremes, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata has awakened to the Middle Way, which gives rise to vision, gives rise to knowledge, leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tathāgata, which gives rise to vision, gives rise to knowledge, leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna? It is this Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness. This, bhikkhus, is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tathāgata, which gives rise to vision, gives rise to knowledge, leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering (discontentment, stress): birth is suffering, aging is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering; association with the unpleasant is suffering, separation from the pleasant is suffering, not getting what one desires is suffering — in summary, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the arising of suffering: it is this craving which leads to rebirth, accompanied by delight and lust, finding delight here and there; namely, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for non-existence.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading and cessation of that same craving, the forsaking and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, absence of reliance on it.\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path; namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right collectedness.\n\n'In regards to the noble truth of suffering', bhikkhus, vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of suffering should be fully comprehended', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of suffering has been fully comprehended', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\n'In regards to the noble truth of the arising of suffering', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of the arising of suffering should be abandoned', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of the arising of suffering has been abandoned', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\n'In regards to this noble truth of the cessation of suffering', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\n'In regards to this noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me (about things not heard before). 'This noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering should be developed', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me. 'This noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed', vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light arose in me.\n\nAs long as my knowledge and vision regarding these Four Noble Truths in their three phases and twelve aspects was not fully purified, I did not claim to have achieved the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its deities (devas), Māra, Brahmā (God), among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners.\n\nBut when my knowledge and vision regarding these four noble truths in their three phases and twelve aspects was fully purified, then I claimed to have achieved the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its deities, Māra, Brahmā, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, kings and commoners.\n\nAnd knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakeable is my liberation, this is my last birth, there is no more rebirth for me.'\"\n\nThis the Blessed One said. Satisfied, the group of five bhikkhus rejoiced in what the Blessed One had said.\n\nMoreover, while this exposition was being given, the venerable Kondañña's mind was freed from the taints through the absence of clinging: \"Whatever arises is subject to cessation.\"\n\nWhen the Blessed One had set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion, the earth-bound deities proclaimed: \"At Varanasi, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, the Unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, not to be halted by any ascetic, brahmin, deities, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world.\"\n\nHearing the earth-bound deities, the deities of the Four Great Kings… the Tāvatiṁsa deities… the Yāma deities… the Tusita deities… the Nimmānaratī deities… the Paranimmitavasavattī deities… the Brahmās joined in: \"At Varanasi, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, the Unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, not to be halted by any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Māra, Brahmā (God), or anyone in the world.\"\n\nThus, at that moment, that instant, that second, the cry reached as far as the Brahmā world, and this ten-thousandfold universe shook, quaked, and trembled, and a boundless, splendid radiance surpassed the divine majesty of the deities.\n\nThen the Blessed One declared: \"Truly, Kondañña has realized! Truly, Kondañña has realized!\"\n\nThus, Venerable Kondañña became known as \"Añña Kondañña—Kondañña Who Has Realized.\""}]}

Listen to this and pay close attention, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"What, bhikkhus, is the domain of a person without integrity? A person without integrity, bhikkhus, is ungrateful and does not acknowledge the help given to them. It is recognized, bhikkhus, as the mark of a person without integrity to be ungrateful and to not acknowledge what has been done for them. This, bhikkhus, is the entirety of the domain of a person without integrity: ungratefulness and not acknowledging what has been done for them. And what, bhikkhus, is the domain of a person with integrity? A person with integrity, bhikkhus, is grateful and acknowledges the help given to them. It is recognized, bhikkhus, as the mark of a person with integrity to be grateful and to acknowledge what has been done for them. This, bhikkhus, is the entirety of the domain of a person with integrity: gratitude and acknowledging what has been done for them.\"\n\n## 2.33\n\n\"Bhikkhus, I say there are two people who are not easy to repay. Which two? One's mother and father.\n\nEven if a person were to carry one's mother on one shoulder and one's father on the other shoulder and live for a hundred years, and if they were to attend to them by anointing, massaging, bathing, and rubbing their limbs, even if they were to defecate and urinate right there, still, bhikkhus, they would not have done enough for their parents, nor would they have repaid them.\n\nAnd even if one were to establish their parents in sovereign authority over this great earth, abounding in wealth and treasures, still, bhikkhus, they would not have done enough for their parents, nor would they have repaid them. Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, parents are of great help to their children; they bring them up, nourish them, and show them the world.\n\nBut, bhikkhus, if one encourages, settles, and establishes their unbelieving parents in experiential confidence (faith), their immoral parents in ethical conduct, their stingy parents in generosity, and their foolish parents in wisdom — in this way, bhikkhus, one has done enough for their parents and repaid them.\"\n\n## 2.34\n\nThen a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One, and having approached, exchanged greetings with him. When the courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One, \"What does Venerable Gotama teach? What does he declare?\"\n\n\"I teach action and I teach non-action, brahmin.\"\n\n\"How, Venerable Gotama, do you teach action and non-action?\"\n\n\"I teach, brahmin, the non-action of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct, and of all sorts of evil and unwholesome qualities. And I teach the action of bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, mental good conduct, and of all sorts of wholesome qualities. Thus, brahmin, I teach action and non-action.\"\n\n\"Excellent, Venerable Gotama! ... Please consider me as a lay follower who has gone to you for refuge from this day forth for life.\"\n\n## 2.35\n\nThen the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, and having approached, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, how many persons are worthy of offerings in the world? Where should gifts be given?\"\n\n\"Householder, there are two persons in the world who are worthy of offerings — the trainee and the arahant. These are the two persons worthy of offerings in the world, and gifts should be given to them.\"\n\nThis is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One further said:\n\n\"The trainee and the arahant in this world,\nAre worthy of offerings from those who make offerings;\nThey are upright in body,\nin speech, and in mind;\nThat field for those who make offerings\nGives great fruit.\"\n\n## 2.36\n\nThus have I heard — at one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park.\n\nAt that time, the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Sāvatthi in the Eastern park, in Migāra's mother's mansion. There, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus, saying: \"Friends, bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" they responded to the Venerable Sāriputta. The Venerable Sāriputta said:\n\n\"I will explain to you, friends, the person with internal fetters and the person with external fetters. Listen to it, attend carefully, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, friend,\" the bhikkhus responded to Venerable Sāriputta. The Venerable Sāriputta said:\n\n\"And what, friends, is the person with internal fetters? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the precepts, accomplished in conduct and field of activity, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and having undertaken the training rules, trains in them. After breaking up of the body, beyond death, he arises in a certain heavenly realm. From there, having fallen away, he returns to this world. This is called, friends, the person with internal fetters who returns to this world.\n\nAnd what, friends, is the person with external fetters? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the precepts, accomplished in conduct and field of activity, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and having undertaken the training rules, trains in them. He arrives at and dwells in a certain peaceful release of mind. After breaking up of the body, beyond death, he arises in a certain heavenly realm. From there, having fallen away, he becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world. This is called, friends, the person with external fetters who becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world.\n\nFurthermore, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the precepts, accomplished in conduct and field of activity, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and having undertaken the training rules, trains in them. He is engaged for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of sensual pleasures. He is engaged for the disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of existence. He is engaged for the ending of craving. He is engaged for the ending of greed. After breaking up the body, beyond death, he arises in a certain heavenly realm. From there, having fallen away, he becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world. This is called, friends, the person with external fetters who becomes a non-returner, one who does not come back to this world.\"\n\nThen many equanimous deities approached the Blessed One; having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, those deities said to the Blessed One: \"Venerable sir, the Venerable Sāriputta is teaching the bhikkhus at the Eastern park, in Migāra's mother's mansion, about the person with internal fetters and the person with external fetters. The assembly is joyful. Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One, out of compassion, would approach the Venerable Sāriputta.\" The Blessed One consented by silence.\n\nThen the Blessed One — just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm — disappeared from Jeta's Grove and reappeared in the Eastern park, in Migāra's mother's mansion, in front of the Venerable Sāriputta. The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat. The Venerable Sāriputta also paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to the Venerable Sāriputta:\n\n\"Here, Sāriputta, many equanimous deities approached me; having approached, they paid homage to me and stood to one side. Standing to one side, those deities said to me: 'Venerable sir, the Venerable Sāriputta is teaching the bhikkhus at the Eastern park, in Migāra's mother's mansion, about the person with internal fetters and the person with external fetters. The assembly is joyful. Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One, out of compassion, would approach the Venerable Sāriputta.'\n\nHowever, Sāriputta, those deities, even when they become ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, even at the tip of a needle, they stand without obstructing each other.\n\nIt might be, however, Sāriputta, one might think thus: 'Surely, the minds of those deities are so developed that even when they become ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, they stand at the tip of a needle without obstructing each other.' However, Sāriputta, this should not be seen in this way. Here itself, Sāriputta, the minds of those deities became so developed that even when they become ten ... and do not obstruct each other.\"\n\nTherefore, Sāriputta, you should train thus: 'We will be calm in faculties, calm in mind.' Thus, you should train, Sāriputta. For in those with calm faculties and calm minds, only calm bodily action, calm verbal action, and calm mental action will arise. We will offer only calm offerings to our fellow practitioners. Thus, you should train, Sāriputta.\n\nIndeed, Sāriputta, the wanderers of other sects will not hear this teaching of the Dhamma.\"\n\n## 2.37\n\nThus have I heard — at one time, the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling in Varaṇā, on the banks of the Bhaddasāri River.\n\nThen, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side. Seated there, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa said to the Venerable Mahākaccāna:\n\n\"What, good Kaccāna, is the reason, what is the cause, why kshatriyas quarrel with kshatriyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders?\"\n\n\"Brahmin, it is because of their attachment to sensual desire, their clinging to sensual desire, their engagement with sensual desire, their bondage to sensual desire, and their obsession with sensual desire that kshatriyas quarrel with kshatriyas, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders.\"\n\n\"What, good Kaccāna, is the reason, what is the cause, why ascetics quarrel with ascetics?\"\n\n\"Brahmin, it is because of their attachment to views, their clinging to views, their engagement with views, their bondage to views, and their obsession with views that ascetics quarrel with ascetics.\"\n\n\"Is there anyone, good Kaccāna, in the world who has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views?\"\n\n\"There is, brahmin, someone in the world who has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views.\"\n\n\"Who, good Kaccāna, is that person in the world who has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views?\"\n\n\"There is, brahmin, in the eastern regions, a city called Sāvatthi. There, the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is now living. He, brahmin, the Blessed One, has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire, as well as this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views.\"\n\nWhen this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and placing his right knee on the ground, he bowed down with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, and said three times:\n\n\"Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!\n\nHomage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!\n\nHomage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One!\n\nIndeed, the Blessed One has overcome this attachment to sensual desire, clinging to sensual desire, engagement with sensual desire, bondage to sensual desire, and obsession with sensual desire. He has also overcome this attachment to views, clinging to views, engagement with views, bondage to views, and obsession with views.\n\nExcellent, good Kaccāna! Excellent, good Kaccāna! Just as if one might set upright what was overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms, in the same way, good Kaccāna, the Dhamma has been explained by you in many ways. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Venerable Kaccāna accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from today onward for life.\"\n\n## 2.38\n\nAt one time, the Venerable Mahākaccāna was dwelling in Madhurā, in Gunda's Grove.\n\nThen, the brahmin Kandarāyana approached the Venerable Mahākaccāna and, after exchanging greetings, sat down to one side. Seated there, the brahmin Kandarāyana said to the Venerable Mahākaccāna:\n\n\"I have heard it said, good Kaccāna, that 'Kaccāna the recluse does not show respect to aged, elderly, senior, long-standing brahmins by rising up, offering a seat, or greeting them.' Is this true, good Kaccāna? Is it correct that you, Kaccāna, do not show respect to aged, elderly, senior, long-standing brahmins by rising up, offering a seat, or greeting them? This is not proper, good Kaccāna.\"\n\n\"There is, brahmin, a distinction explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, between the status of the elder and the status of the youth. A person may be old, eighty, ninety, or a hundred years of age by birth, but if he indulges in sensual pleasures, lives amidst sensual pleasures, burns with the fever of sensual pleasures, is consumed by sensual thoughts, and is agitated by the search for sensual pleasures, then such a person, though old, is considered immature, not an elder. Conversely, a person may be young, a youth with black hair, blessed with youth and the prime of life. But if he does not indulge in sensual pleasures, does not live amidst sensual pleasures, is not burned by the fever of sensual pleasures, is not consumed by sensual thoughts, and is not agitated by the search for sensual pleasures, then such a person, though young, is considered wise, and is indeed an elder.\"\n\nHaving said this, the brahmin Kandarāyana rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, and bowed his head at the feet of the hundred young bhikkhus, saying: \"You are elders, standing on the ground of elders. We are youths, standing on the ground of youths.\"\n\n\"Excellent, good Kaccāna! ... From this day forth, let the Venerable Kaccāna consider me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.\"\n\n## 2.39\n\n\"Bhikkhus, when robbers are strong, kings at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the king is not able to travel or send out forces to the border regions, or to effectively govern the outlying provinces. Likewise, at that time, it is not easy for brahmins and householders to travel, send out forces, or inspect their fields and workers. Similarly, bhikkhus, when bhikkhus who practice wrongly are strong, bhikkhus who practice rightly at that time are weak. Then, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus who practice rightly remain silent and subdued within the Sangha, or they dwell in the outlying regions. This situation is for the harm and misfortune of many, for the suffering and detriment of many persons, gods, and humans.\n\nBhikkhus, when kings are strong, robbers at that time are weak.

Then, in the morning, having dressed and taken his bowl and robe, he entered Sāvatthi for alms. Having wandered for alms in Sāvatthi and after the meal, having returned from his alms gathering, he approached the Dark Forest for the day's abiding. Having entered the Dark Forest, he sat down at the root of a certain tree for the day's abiding.\n\nThen, in the evening, having emerged from seclusion, he approached Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. The Venerable Ānanda saw Venerable Sāriputta coming from afar. Seeing him, Venerable Ānanda said:\n\n\"Your faculties are clear, friend Sāriputta; your facial complexion is pure and bright. In what dwelling have you dwelled today, Venerable Sāriputta?\"\n\n\"Here, friend, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna, which includes thought and examination, with the joy and happiness born of seclusion. For me, friend, the experience was not characterized by thoughts such as 'I am entering the first jhāna,' 'I have entered the first jhāna,' or 'I have emerged from the first jhāna.'\"\n\n\"Indeed, Venerable Sāriputta has long ago eradicated the underlying tendencies towards I-making, mine-making, and conceit. Therefore, for him, there is no such thought process as 'I am entering the first jhāna,' 'I have entered the first jhāna,' or 'I have emerged from the first jhāna.'\""}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Bhikkhus.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir,\" those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:\n\n\"People recognize you as 'ascetics, ascetics,' bhikkhus. But when asked 'Who are you?' you reply 'We are ascetics.'\n\n#### Training Guidelines\n\nFor you, bhikkhus, being recognized and acknowledging yourselves in this way, it should be understood that 'We will undertake and practice those things (dhammas) that lead to being an ascetic and a Brahmin, so that our recognition and acknowledgment will be true and factual. And for us, consuming the requisites such as robes, alms food, lodgings, and medical supplies, this conduct will bring great benefit and great merit, and our going forth will not be in vain but fruitful and successful.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, are the dhammas that lead to being an ascetic and a Brahmin? 'We will be endowed with shame and moral dread.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Conduct By Body, Speech, and Mind\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'Our bodily conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure bodily conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct is pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'Our verbal conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure verbal conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct and verbal conduct are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'Our mental conduct will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure mental conduct, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much.

'Our livelihood will be pure, open, clear, and restrained. And by being endowed with such pure livelihood, we shall neither reproach ourselves nor others.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, and livelihood are pure; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Guarding the Sense Faculties\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will guard the doors of our sense faculties. Upon seeing a form with the eye, we will not grasp at its signs or features. Since if we left the eye faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade us, we will practice its restraint, guard the eye faculty, achieve restraint over the eye faculty. Upon hearing a sound with the ear ... upon smelling an odor with the nose ... upon tasting a flavor with the tongue ... upon touching a tangible with the body ... upon cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind, we will not grasp at its signs or features. Since if we left the mind faculty unguarded, unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade us, we will practice its restraint, guard the mind faculty, achieve restraint over the mind faculty.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, livelihood are pure, and we guard the doors of our sense faculties; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Moderation in Eating\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will be moderate in eating, reflecting wisely on the food we consume, not for fun, not for pleasure, not for fattening, not for beautification, but only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body, for keeping it healthy, for helping with the spiritual life, thinking thus: 'I will terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I will be healthy and blameless and live in comfort.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think, 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, livelihood are pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Wakefulness\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will be devoted to wakefulness. During the day, we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states. During the first watch of the night [dusk to 10 PM], we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states. During the middle watch of the night [10 PM to 2 AM], we will lie down on the right side in the posture of a lion, stacking one foot over the other, maintaining mindfulness and alertness, keeping in mind the intention to awaken (whether spontaneously or at a predetermined time). In the last watch of the night [2 AM to dawn], upon rising, we will practice walking back and forth and sitting, purifying our minds from obstructive states.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think: 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct is pure, our verbal conduct is pure, our mental conduct is pure, our livelihood is pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\n##### Mindfulness and Full Awareness\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? 'We will be equipped with mindfulness and full awareness. When going forward and returning, we will act with full awareness. When looking ahead and looking away, we will act with full awareness. When flexing and extending our limbs, we will act with full awareness. In wearing our robes and carrying our outer robe and bowl, we will act with full awareness. When eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting, we will act with full awareness. In defecating and urinating, we will act with full awareness. When walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and keeping silent, we will act with full awareness.' This is how, bhikkhus, you should train. However, bhikkhus, it might be that you think: 'We are endowed with shame and moral dread, our bodily conduct is pure, our verbal conduct is pure, our mental conduct is pure, our livelihood is pure, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, we are moderate in eating, devoted to wakefulness, equipped with mindfulness and full awareness; this is enough, what we have done is enough, our purpose for going forth is achieved, there is nothing more to be done,' and you might be satisfied with that much. I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus: 'Do not let the goal for which ascetics are rightfully ascetics pass you by, while there is still more to be done.'\n\nAnd bhikkhus, what more is there to be done? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells in a secluded lodging — in the forest, at the root of a tree, on a mountain, in a ravine, in a mountain cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest thicket, in the open air, on a heap of straw.\n\n#### Five Hindrances\n\nAfter the meal, having returned from alms-round, a bhikkhu sits down, crosses his legs, sets his body erect, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. He lives with a mind free from longing towards the world, purifying his mind from longing; he lives with a mind free from ill-will and hatred, feeling compassion for all living beings, purifying his mind from ill-will and hatred; he lives free from dullness and drowsiness (complacency), perceiving light, mindful and fully aware, purifying his mind from dullness and drowsiness; he lives free from restlessness and worry (mental agitation, anxiety), with an inwardly peaceful mind, purifying his mind from restlessness and worry; he lives free from doubt, having crossed over doubt, without doubting about wholesome states, purifying his mind from doubt.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, might take a loan to invest in a business. And that business succeeds. He would then repay his old debts and still have some profit left over for his family. He would think: 'Before, I took a loan to invest in a business, and that business succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and still have some profit left over for supporting my family.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, who was sick, in pain, and seriously ill, and his food did not nourish him, and his body had no strength. Then later on he recovers from that illness, his food nourishes him, and he regains strength in his body. He would think: 'Before, I was sick, in pain, and seriously ill, my food did not nourish me, and my body had no strength. Now, I have recovered from that illness, my food nourishes me, and I have regained strength in my body.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, who was imprisoned. Then later on he is released from prison, safe and secure, without any loss of his belongings. He would think: 'Before, I was imprisoned, now I have been released from prison, safe and secure, without any loss of my belongings.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, who was a slave, not free, dependent on others, unable to go where he wants. Then later on he is freed from slavery, becomes independent, not dependent on others, free to go where he wants. He would think: 'Before, I was a slave, not free, dependent on others, unable to go where I want. Now, I am freed from slavery, independent, not dependent on others, free to go where I want.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nJust as a person, bhikkhus, with wealth and possessions would travel through a dangerous path. Then later on he gets through that dangerous path safely, securely, without any loss of his belongings. He would think: 'Before, with wealth and possessions, I traveled through a dangerous path. Now, I have gotten through that dangerous path safely, securely, without any loss of my belongings.' He would then be glad and full of joy.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees these five hindrances in himself as if they were a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, a dangerous path. And when these five hindrances are abandoned, he sees himself as free from debt, healthy, released from prison, free from slavery, in a place of safety.\n\n#### Four Jhānas\n\n##### First Jhāna\n\nHaving abandoned these five hindrances, impediments to the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which includes reflection and examination (of thoughts), with joyful pleasure born of seclusion. He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by the joyful pleasure born of seclusion. Just as a skilled bath man or his apprentice might knead water into bath powder so that the ball of bath powder is soaked and pervaded with moisture inside and out, yet does not drip.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by the joyful pleasure born of seclusion.\n\n##### Second Jhāna\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, with the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal tranquility and unification of mind, is without reflection or examination, and has joyful pleasure born of collectedness. He suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with joyful pleasure born of collectedness, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by joyful pleasure born of collectedness. Just as in a lake with spring water welling up from below, it would fill and overflow with cool water, so that there is no part of the lake not suffused by cool water.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu suffuses, pervades, fills, and permeates his entire body with the joyful pleasure born of collectedness, so that there is no part of his body not suffused by joyful pleasure born of collectedness.\n\n##### Third Jhāna\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, with the fading away of joyful pleasure, a bhikkhu dwells equanimous, mindful and fully aware, and experiences ease (bliss) with the body, which the noble ones describe as, 'one who dwells happily, equanimous, and at ease.' He enters and dwells in the third jhāna. He permeates, pervades, fills, and suffuses this very body with ease devoid of delight, so that there is no part of his entire body that is not suffused with ease devoid of delight. Just as, bhikkhus, in a pond of blue, red, or white lotuses, some lotuses born in the water, grown in the water, and standing with their stalks immersed in the water, would be thoroughly permeated, pervaded, filled, and suffused from their tips to their roots with cool water, so that there is no part of the entire lotus that is not suffused with cool water.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu permeates, pervades, fills, and suffuses his entire body with ease devoid of delight, so that there is no part of his body that is not suffused with ease devoid of delight.\n\n##### Fourth Jhāna\n\nFurther, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, with the abandoning of both ease (bliss) and suffering (discontentment, stress), and with the previous disappearance of joy and sorrow, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensation, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna which is characterized by the purity of equanimity and mindfulness. He permeates, pervades, fills, and suffuses this very body with a pure, clear mind, so that there is no part of his entire body that is not suffused with a pure, clear mind. Just as, bhikkhus, a person covered from head to toe with a white cloth would have no part of his entire body uncovered by the white cloth.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sits pervading this very body with a pure mind, so purified and clarified, that there is no part of his whole body not pervaded by the pure mind.\n\n#### Three Knowledges\n\nThus with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births ... thus with their aspects and particulars, he recollects his manifold past lives. Just as a man might go from his own village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village return to his own village. He remembers, 'I went from my own village to that village, there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way; from that village I went to yet another village ... and from that village I have returned to my own.'\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives, with their aspects and particulars.\n\nThus, with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, malleable, flexible, suitable for use, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the passing away and reappearing of beings. With the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands beings according to their actions. Just as if there were two houses with doors, and a man with good eyesight standing between them could see people coming into and going out of the houses, walking around and roaming inside.\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu with the divine eye, purified and surpassing human vision, sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understands beings according to their actions.\n\nThus, with the mind collected, purified, clarified, blemish-free, free from impurities, flexible, suitable for use, stable, and unshakeable, he directs the mind towards the knowledge of the ending of the taints (source of defilements). He understands as it actually is, 'This is suffering,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the origin of suffering,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the cessation of suffering,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it actually is, 'These are the taints,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the origin of the taints,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the cessation of the taints,' he understands as it actually is, 'This is the path leading to the cessation of the taints.' Knowing and seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, the taint of being, and the taint of ignorance. In liberation, there arises the knowledge: 'It is liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nJust as, bhikkhus, in a mountain lake that is deep, clear and undisturbed, a person with good eyesight standing on the shore can see shells, gravel, pebbles, and also fish swimming about or resting, and it would occur to him, 'This mountain lake is deep, clear, and undisturbed. Here are these shells, gravel, pebbles, and also these fish swimming about or resting.'\n\nIn the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it actually is, 'This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, and this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering. These are the taints, this is the origin of the taints, this is the cessation of the taints, and this is the path leading to the cessation of the taints.' Understanding thus, he realizes, 'there is no more coming to any state of being.'\n\nThis, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who is thus a 'ascetic', a 'brahmin', a 'bathed one', a 'knower of the vedas', a 'well-learned one', a 'noble one', an 'arahant'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'ascetic'? When he has calmed down evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'ascetic'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'brahmin'? When he has expelled evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'brahmin'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'bathed one'? When he has bathed away evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'bathed one'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'knower of the vedas'? When he has understood evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'knower of the vedas'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'well-learned one'? When he has washed away evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'well-learned one'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become a 'noble one'? When he is purified from evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes a 'noble one'.\n\nAnd how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu become an 'arahant'? When he is (completely) purified from evil, unwholesome states that are defiling, leading to rebirth, associated with sorrow, resulting in suffering, and leading to old age, sickness, and death. This is how, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu becomes an 'arahant'.\n\nThe Blessed One said this.  The bhikkhus, satisfied, rejoiced in the Blessed One's words."}]}

These, bhikkhus, are the two elements of Nibbāna.\"\n\nThe Blessed One spoke thus, it is said:\n\n\"These two elements of Nibbāna were clarified\nBy the one with insight, detached and serene.\nThe first element pertains to this current life,\nit is what remains when the bond to rebirth is broken;\nThe second element pertains to beyond this life,\nwhere all states of existence utterly cease.\n\nThose who, understanding this, attain the unconditioned state,\ntheir minds liberated, the bond to rebirth broken;\nreaching the essence of the Dhamma, delighting in its cessation,\nsuch balanced ones relinquish all states of existence.\"\n\nThis matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard."}]}

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: \"Because of not fully understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths, bhikkhus, both you and I have run and wandered this long course of samsara (transmigration), for a very long time.\n\nWhat are these four? It is because of not fully understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of suffering, bhikkhus, that both you and I have run and wandered this long course of samsara, for a very long time. It is because of not fully understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering, that both you and I have run and wandered this long course of samsara, for a very long time. But now, bhikkhus, having fully understood and penetrated the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering; the craving for existence is severed, the entanglement of becoming is destroyed; there is no more rebirth.\"\n\nThis is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Well-gone One, the Teacher, further said:\n\n\"Due to not seeing as they truly are,\nThe Four Noble Truths;\nWe've roamed and wandered on,\nThrough many a birth in samsara.\n\nThese truths now seen,\nThe net of becoming torn asunder;\nThe root of suffering cut,\nNo more is there rebirth.\""}]}

He sat down on his own seat and asked the Blessed One:\n\n\"Are these, venerable sir, the five aggregates subject to clinging, namely: form aggregate subject to clinging, feeling aggregate subject to clinging, perception aggregate subject to clinging, volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, and consciousness aggregate subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"These, bhikkhu, are indeed the five aggregates subject to clinging; namely: form aggregate subject to clinging, feeling aggregate subject to clinging, perception aggregate subject to clinging, volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, and consciousness aggregate subject to clinging.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu, pleased and appreciative of what the Blessed One had said, asked another question:\n\n\"What, venerable sir, is the root of these five aggregates subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhus, these five aggregates subject to clinging have desire as their root\".\n\n\"Venerable sir, is that very clinging the same as these five aggregates subject to clinging, or is it something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"Bhikkhu, that very clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates subject to clinging nor is it something apart from the five aggregates subject to clinging; but whatever desire and lust is therein, that is the clinging therein.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"Is it possible, venerable sir, for there to be moderation in desire and lust within these five aggregates subject to clinging?\"\n\n\"It is possible, bhikkhu,\" the Blessed One said:\n\n\"Here, bhikkhu, someone thinks: 'May I be of such form in the future, may I have such feeling in the future, may I have such perception in the future, may I have such volitional formations in the future, may I have such consciousness in the future.' Thus, bhikkhu, there can be moderation in desire and lust within these five aggregates subject to clinging.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"How far, venerable sir, does the term 'aggregates' apply?\"\n\n\"Whatever form, bhikkhu, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the form aggregate. Whatever feeling, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the feeling aggregate. Whatever perception, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the perception aggregate. Whatever volitional formations, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the volitional formations aggregate. Whatever consciousness, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all that is called the consciousness aggregate. Thus far, bhikkhu, the term 'aggregates' applies.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"What, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the form aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the perception aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregate; what is the cause, what is the condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate?\"\n\n\"The four great elements, bhikkhu, are the cause, the four great elements are the condition for the manifestation of the form aggregate. Contact is the cause, contact is the condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate. Contact is the cause, contact is the condition for the manifestation of the perception aggregate. Contact is the cause, contact is the condition for the manifestation of the volitional formations aggregate. Name-and-form is the cause, name-and-form is the condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"How does self-view arise?\"\n\n\"Here, bhikkhu, an uninstructed ordinary person, who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or self as in form; regards feeling as self, or self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or self as in feeling; regards perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or self as in perception; regards volitional formations as self, or self as possessing volitional formations, or volitional formations as in the self, or self as in volitional formations; regards consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or self as in consciousness. This is how self-view arises, bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu asked further:\n\n\"How does self-view not arise?\"\n\n\"Here, bhikkhu, a learned noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or self as in form; does not regard feeling as self, or self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or self as in feeling; does not regard perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or self as in perception; does not regard volitional formations as self, or self as possessing volitional formations, or volitional formations as in the self, or self as in volitional formations; does not regard consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or self as in consciousness. This is how self-view does not arise, bhikkhu.\"\n\n\"What is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of form; what is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness?\"\n\n\"The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on form, bhikkhu, that is the gratification in form. That form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in form. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for form, that is the escape from form. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on feeling, that is the gratification in feeling. That feeling is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in feeling. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for feeling, that is the escape from feeling. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on perception, that is the gratification in perception. That perception is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in perception. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for perception, that is the escape from perception. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on volitional formations, that is the gratification in volitional formations. That volitional formations are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in volitional formations. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for volitional formations, that is the escape from volitional formations. The pleasure and joy that arise dependent on consciousness, that is the gratification in consciousness. That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, that is the danger in consciousness. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for consciousness, that is the escape from consciousness.\"\n\n\"Excellent, venerable sir,\" the bhikkhu, pleased and appreciative of what the Blessed One had said, asked another question:\n\n\"How, venerable sir, for one who knows and sees, in this very life, with regard to this consciousness-containing body and all external signs, is there no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit?\"\n\n\"Whatever form, bhikkhu, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all form: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever feeling, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all feeling: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever perception, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all perception: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever volitional formations, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all volitional formations: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. Whatever consciousness, past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' thus, it is seen as it really is with right wisdom. This is how, bhikkhu, for one who knows and sees, in this very life, with regard to this consciousness-containing body and all external signs, there is no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit.\"\n\nAt that time, it occurred to a certain bhikkhu:\n\n\"So it seems, indeed, form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, volitional formations are not-self, consciousness is not-self; how then do actions performed by a not-self affect oneself?\"\n\nThen, the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thought in that bhikkhu's mind, addressed the bhikkhus:\n\n\"There is this possibility, bhikkhus, that someone, being ignorant (misapprehending true reality), under the sway of craving, might thus misinterpret the teaching: 'So it seems, indeed, form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, volitional formations are not-self, consciousness is not-self. How then do actions performed by a not-self affect oneself?' You should be trained in this way, bhikkhus, regarding these matters.\n\nWhat do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"Is feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness permanent or impermanent?\"\n\n\"Impermanent, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?\"\n\n\"Suffering, venerable sir.\"\n\n\"And is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?\"\n\n\"It is not fitting, venerable sir.\"\n\nTherefore, in this way, bhikkhus, one understands: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self' with regard to all forms, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, and consciousness, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near. By seeing these aggregates in this way, one becomes disenchanted with form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Through disenchantment, one becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, one is liberated. With liberation, there comes the knowledge that one is liberated, and one understands: 'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.'\n\nThese are the ten questions posed by the bhikkhu:\nTwo concern the aggregates—\nAsking if they are the same or distinct,\nAnd about designation along with cause.\nTwo more relate to identity,\nWith one each on the themes of gratification,\nAnd the consciousness-containing body."}]}
