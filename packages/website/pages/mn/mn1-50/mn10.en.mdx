Thus have I heard — Once, the Blessed One was living in the land of the Kurus, in a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus."

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

"This is the only way, bhikkhus, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the subsiding of suffering and discontentment, for the attainment of the right path, for the realization of Nibbāna, namely the four establishments of mindfulness.

What are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed \{craving and displeasure} (greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]) with regard to the world; he dwells observing the feelings in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world; he dwells observing the mind in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world; he dwells observing the mental qualities in and of themselves, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed craving and displeasure with regard to the world.

### 1. Contemplation of the Body

#### 1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing
How, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him. Mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.

Breathing in long, he knows, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he knows, 'I breathe out long';

breathing in short, he knows, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he knows, 'I breathe out short'.

He trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'.

He trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation'.

Just as a skilled turner (carpenter) or his apprentice, when making a long turn knows, 'I make a long turn', or making a short turn knows, 'I make a short turn'; so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu knows, 'I breathe in long'; breathing out long, he knows, 'I breathe out long'; breathing in short, he knows, 'I breathe in short'; breathing out short, he knows, 'I breathe out short'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation'; he trains thus, 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation'.

Thus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.

Thus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.

#### 1.2. Contemplation of the Body in Postures
Again, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu knows, 'I am walking'; when standing, he knows, 'I am standing'; when sitting, he knows, 'I am sitting'; when lying down, he knows, 'I am lying down'; or however his body is disposed, he knows it.

Thus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.

Thus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.

The section on Postures is completed.

#### 1.3. Contemplation of the Body in full awareness
Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with full awareness when going forward and returning; who acts with full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts with full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts with full awareness in wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts with full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts with full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts with full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

Thus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body. The awareness 'There is a body' is simply established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.

Thus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.

The section on full awareness is completed.

#### 1.4. Contemplation of the Body in the Asubha Practice (Reflection on repulsiveness)
Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the top of the hair down, bounded by skin and full of various impurities: 'In this body, there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, contents of the stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, oil of the joints, and urine.'

Just as if, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain, such as rice, barley, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyesight having opened it were to reflect, 'These are rice, these are barley, these are beans, these are peas, these are millet, these are white rice.'

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the top of the head down, surrounded by skin and filled with various kinds of impurity: 'In this body, there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach contents, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spit, snot, synovial fluid, urine.'

Thus, he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body.

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: 'In this body, there are the earth element, water element, fire element, and air element.'

Just as if, bhikkhus, a skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice, having killed a cow, were to sit at a crossroads with it cut up into pieces.

In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body, as it stands, as it is laid down, according to elements: 'In this body, there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element.'

Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing phenomena in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing phenomena in the body. 'There is a body,' thus mindfulness is established in him to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent and does not cling to anything in the world.

The section on Reflection on the Elements is completed.

#### 1.6. Contemplation of the Body in the Cemetery Contemplations
Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery one, two, or three days dead, bloated, discolored, and decomposing.

Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally, or he dwells contemplating the body externally, or he dwells contemplating the body both internally and externally. He dwells contemplating the arising factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating the vanishing factors in the body, or he dwells contemplating both the arising and vanishing factors in the body.

He applies this perception to his own body: 'This very body is of the same nature, it will become like that, it is not beyond that.' Thus he dwells contemplating the body internally...

Thus, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating the body in the body.

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, just as if he saw a corpse thrown in a cemetery, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews... a skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews... a fleshless skeleton, held together with sinews... bones scattered in all directions, here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a hip bone, there a backbone, here a rib bone, there a breast bone, here an arm bone, there a shoulder bone, here a neck bone, there a jaw bone, here a tooth, there a skull.
