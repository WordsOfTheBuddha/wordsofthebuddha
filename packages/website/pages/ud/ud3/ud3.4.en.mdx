Thus have I heard—At At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. Now, at that time, the venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed One, having folded his legs in a \{cross-legged sitting position} (meditation posture [pallaṅka]), aligning his body upright, and having set up mindfulness (observing the body in and of itself, felt experience in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of themselves [sati]) \{at the fore} (as first priority, at the tip of the nose or on the upper lip [parimukhaṃ]).

The Blessed One saw the venerable Sāriputta sitting not far away, having folded his legs in a cross-legged sitting position, aligning his body upright, and having set up mindfulness at the fore.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"Just as a rocky mountain,
is unshakable (immovable [acala]) and \{firmly grounded} (fully centered [suppatiṭṭhita]);
In the same way, with the \{complete ending of delusion} (exhaustion of delusion, illusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view; that which fuels not knowing of things as they have come to be [mohakkhaya]),
a bhikkhu does not shake (tremble, agitate [vedhatī]) like the mountain."
