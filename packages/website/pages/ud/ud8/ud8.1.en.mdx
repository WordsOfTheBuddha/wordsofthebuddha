Thus have I heard — once the Blessed One was staying in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. At that time, the Blessed One was instructing, inciting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk related to Nibbāna. The bhikkhus were attentive, having applied themselves entirely, mentally gathered, with ears ready, listening to the Dhamma.

Then, knowing the significance of that moment, the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:

"Bhikkhus, there exists a base (āyatanaṁ), where there is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor wind; neither the base of infinite space, nor the base of infinite consciousness, nor the base of nothingness, nor the base of neither perception nor non-perception; neither this world, nor the other world, nor both, nor sun nor moon. Here, bhikkhus, I say there is no coming, no going, no staying, no passing away, no arising. It is without support, without occurrence, and without object. This, bhikkhus, is the end of suffering."
