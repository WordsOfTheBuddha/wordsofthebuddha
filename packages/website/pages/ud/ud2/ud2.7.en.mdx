Thus have I heard — At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park. At that time, the only beloved and pleasing son of a certain lay follower had died.

Then, many lay followers with wet clothes and wet hair approached the Blessed One during the day; having approached and saluted the Blessed One, they sat down to one side. While sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to the lay followers: "Why do you approach here during the day with wet clothes and wet hair?"

Thus spoken, that lay follower said to the Blessed One: "My only beloved and pleasing son has died, venerable sir. Therefore, we approach here during the day with wet clothes and wet hair."

Upon recognizing this, the Blessed One, in that moment, gave voice to this inspired utterance:

"Those bound by pleasure in what is dear,
Both deities and many humans;
Troubled, suffering misfortune, decayed,
go under the control of the King of Death.

The diligent, who day and night,
leave behind what seems pleasant;
dig out the root of misery —
Death's bait so hard to escape."
