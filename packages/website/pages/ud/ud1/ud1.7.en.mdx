Thus have I heard - At one time, the Blessed One was staying in Pāvā (name of a city, presently Pawapuri), at the Ajakalāpaka shrine, the \{burial site} (grave, burial mound [cetiya]) of the \{native spirit} (a spirit that may be protective or malevolent, a daemon, or a supernatural being [yakkha]) Ajakalāpaka. At that time, the Blessed One was sitting in the open air during the pitch black darkness of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. Then the native spirit Ajakalāpaka, wishing to arouse fear, trepidation, and hair-raising awe in the Blessed One, approached him. Drawing near, the spirit stood not far from the Blessed One and made strange, unsettling sounds three times: "Akkulo! Pakkulo!" He then said, "This is your demon (evil spirit [pisāca]), ascetic!"

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

When a brahmin (a title used by the Buddha for an Arahant, an awakened being [brāhmaṇa]) has gone beyond,
his \{own attachments} (identification with thoughts, emotions, intentions, habits, opinions, beliefs, or things the person interacts with in life, e.g. sensations, relationships, or concepts [sakesu + dhammesu]);
Then the brahmin transcends,
both this demon and the mayhem.
