Thus I have heard — at one time the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large community of bhikkhus. Now, at that time, several \{young brāhmaṇas} ([typically of a brāhmaṇa] youngsters, young boys [māṇavakā]) were passing by not far from the Blessed One in a \{mocking manner} (appearing to be jeering, laughing at, making fun of [sadhāyamānarūpa]). The Blessed One saw the group of young brāhmaṇas passing by at a distance, appearing to be mocking.

Then, understanding the significance of this, the Blessed One at that time expressed this inspired utterance:

"While being muddle-minded, they talk as if wise,
speaking merely in the realm of words;
Stretching their mouths as much as they want,
are led on by what they don't understand."
