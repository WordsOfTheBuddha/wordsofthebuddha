Then, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:

"'Empty is the world, empty is the world', it is said, venerable sir. In what sense, venerable sir, is it said, 'empty is the world'?"

"Because, Ānanda, it is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, therefore it is said, 'empty is the world'. And what, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self?

The eye, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Forms are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, eye-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, eye-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

The ear, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Sounds are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, ear-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, ear-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

The nose, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Odors are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, nose-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, nose-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

The tongue, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Flavors are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, tongue-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, tongue-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

The body, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Tactile sensations are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, body-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, body-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

The mind, Ānanda, is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Mental phenomena (thoughts, emotions, memories, and perceptions) are empty of self and of what belongs to a self, mind-consciousness is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, mind-contact is empty of self and of what belongs to a self.

Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition — whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too is empty of self and of what belongs to a self. Because, Ānanda, it is empty of self and of what belongs to a self, therefore, it is said, 'empty is the world'."
