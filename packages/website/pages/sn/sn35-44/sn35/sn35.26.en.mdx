The eye, bhikkhus, when not thoroughly understood, not fully comprehended, not relinquished, and not cleared away, lacks the capability to bring about the end of suffering. In the same manner, forms, when not thoroughly understood, not fully comprehended, not relinquished, and not cleared away, lack this capability. Eye-consciousness, when not thoroughly understood, not fully comprehended, not relinquished, and not cleared away, lacks this capability. Eye-contact, and whatever feeling arises conditioned by eye-contact, whether it be pleasant, painful or neither pleasant-nor-painful, all, when not thoroughly understood, not fully comprehended, not relinquished, and not cleared away, lack the capability to bring about the end of suffering.

The ear and sounds, when not thoroughly understood, not fully comprehended, not relinquished, and not cleared away, lack this capability.

This, bhikkhus, encompasses everything that, when not thoroughly understood, not fully comprehended, not relinquished, and not cleared away, lacks the capability to bring about the end of suffering.

However, bhikkhus, everything, when thoroughly understood, fully comprehended, relinquished (through dispassion), and cleared away, possesses the capability to bring about the end of suffering. What, bhikkhus, when thoroughly understood, fully comprehended, relinquished, and cleared away, possesses this capability?
