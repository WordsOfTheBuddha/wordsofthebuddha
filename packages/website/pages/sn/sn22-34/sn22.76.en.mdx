At Sāvatthi.

"Form, bhikkhus, is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as, 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,' — thus it should be seen with right wisdom as it really is.

Feeling, bhikkhus, is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as, 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,' — thus it should be seen with right wisdom as it really is.

Perception, bhikkhus, is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as, 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,' — thus it should be seen with right wisdom as it really is.

Volitional Formations, bhikkhus, is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as, 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,' — thus it should be seen with right wisdom as it really is.

Consciousness, bhikkhus, is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is not-self; what is not-self should be seen as, 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,' — thus it should be seen with right wisdom as it really is.

Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the learned noble disciple becomes disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with volitional formations, and disenchanted with consciousness. Becoming disenchanted, they become dispassionate; through dispassion, they are liberated. When liberated, there is the knowledge that 'I am liberated.'"

He knows: 'Re-birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.' Bhikkhus, in all the realms of beings, in all the worlds, these are highest, these are the foremost, namely, the arahants."

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken, the Well-Gone One, the Teacher, further spoke these words:

"Truly at ease are the arahants,
For craving is no longer found in them;
The conceit of 'I am' is cut off,
And the net of delusion is torn apart.

Having arrived at the unperturbed,
their minds are serene;
In the world, they're untainted,
they have become noble, free from defilements.

Having fully understood the five aggregates,
they dwell in the true nature of things;
Praiseworthy are these noble beings,
true-born children of the Buddha.

Endowed with the seven elements of awakening,
Well-trained in the three trainings;
These great heroes wander freely,
Having abandoned the causes of fear and dread.

Endowed with the ten factors,
these great beings are deeply composed;
Indeed, they are the foremost in the world,
for craving is no longer found in them.

The wisdom of the non-learner has arisen,
this is the final accumulation;
It is the heartwood of the spiritual life,
in which there is no further dependence.

They do not waver in any way,
Fully liberated from renewed existence;
They have attained the state of self-control,
These are the conquerors in the world.

Above, across, and below,
No attachment is found in them;
They roar the lion's roar,
The Buddhas, unsurpassed in the world."
