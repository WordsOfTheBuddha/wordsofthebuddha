Thus have I heard — At Sāvatthi.

There the Blessed One said this:

"Form (physical body and external matter, encompassing both one's body and external objects [rūpa]), bhikkhus, is impermanent, sensation (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience, feeling; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]) is impermanent, perception (interpretation and perception of oneself, of things. It can involve concepts, labels, and judgments; third of the five aggregates [sañña]) is impermanent, \{volitional formations} (intentions, choices, decisions, karmic activity; fourth of the five aggregates [saṅkhāra]) are impermanent, consciousness (quality of awareness — subjective awareness of experiences and the knowing of objects through the six sense doors [sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind]; fifth of the five aggregates [viññāṇa]) is impermanent.

Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the well-studied disciple of the noble ones becomes \{disenchanted with} (disillusioned with [nibbindati]) form, becomes disenchanted with sensation, becomes disenchanted with perception, becomes disenchanted with volitional formations, becomes disenchanted with consciousness. Experiencing disenchantment, they become detached (dispassionate [virajjati]); through detachment, there is release. When released, there arises the knowledge: 'Released.'

'Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being,' one understands."
