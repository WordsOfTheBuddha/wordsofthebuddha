At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, there are these four types of meditators. What are the four?

Here, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is skilled in collectedness but not skilled in the support for collectedness.

Here, however, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is skilled in the support for collectedness but not skilled in collectedness.

Here, however, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is neither skilled in collectedness nor skilled in the support for collectedness.

Here, however, bhikkhus, a certain meditator is skilled in both collectedness and the support for collectedness.

Among these, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled in both collectedness and the support for collectedness is considered the foremost, the best, the highest, and the most excellent of these four meditators.

Just as, bhikkhus, from milk comes curd, from curd comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes the cream of ghee, which is regarded as the best;

So too, bhikkhus, the meditator who is skilled in both collectedness and the object of collectedness is the foremost, the best, the highest, and the most excellent of these four meditators.
