Thus have I heard—At At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus."

"Venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

"Ignorance (illusion of knowledge, not knowing [avijjā]), bhikkhus, is the forerunner in the arising of unwholesome qualities, with shamelessness (lack of conscience [ahirika]) and \{moral recklessness} (fearlessness of wrongdoing [anottappa]) following behind. For one who is immersed in ignorance, bhikkhus, wrong view arises; for one with wrong view, wrong intention arises; for one with wrong intention, wrong speech arises; for one with wrong speech, wrong action arises; for one with wrong action, wrong livelihood arises; for one with wrong livelihood, wrong effort arises; for one with wrong effort, wrong mindfulness arises; for one with wrong mindfulness, wrong collectedness (stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]) arises.

"Wisdom, bhikkhus, is the forerunner in the arising of wholesome qualities, with a \{sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing} (conscience and concern, respect for oneself and others [hirottappa]) following along. For one who has arrived at wisdom, bhikkhus, right view arises; for one with right view, right intention arises; for one with right intention, right speech arises; for one with right speech, right action arises; for one with right action, right livelihood arises; for one with right livelihood, right effort arises; for one with right effort, right mindfulness arises; for one with right mindfulness, right collectedness arises."
