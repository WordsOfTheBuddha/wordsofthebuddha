At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, as far as beings go — whether they are footless, two-footed, four-footed, or many-footed; with form or without form; having perception, non-percipient, or neither percipient or non-percipient; the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One is considered the foremost among them. In the same way, bhikkhus, whatever wholesome qualities there are, they are all rooted in diligence (quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]), and they meet together in diligence; diligence is considered the foremost among the qualities. For a diligent bhikkhu, this is to be expected - that he will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.

And how, bhikkhus, does a diligent bhikkhu develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view \{dependent on seclusion} (supported by detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]), \{supported by dispassion} (based on fading of desire [virāganissita]), \{based on ending} (supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]), \{culminating in complete relinquishment} (ripening in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]); similarly he develops right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness, dependent on seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, culminating in complete relinquishment. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a diligent bhikkhu develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.

In the same way, bhikkhus, whatever wholesome qualities there may be, they are all rooted in diligence, and they meet together in diligence; diligence is considered the foremost among the qualities. For a diligent bhikkhu, this is to be expected - that he will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.

And how, bhikkhus, does a diligent bhikkhu develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view, culminating in the removal and ending of desire (passion, infatuation, lust [rāga]), culminating in the removal and ending of aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment [dosa]), and culminating in the removal and ending of delusion (illusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view; that which fuels not knowing of things as they have come to be [moha]); similarly he develops right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness, culminating in the removal of lust, culminating in the removal of aversion, and culminating in the removal of delusion. In this way, bhikkhus, a diligent bhikkhu develops and extensively cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.
