"One thing, bhikkhus, is greatly beneficial for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. What is that one thing? It is\{accomplishment in virtue} (being accomplished in ethical conduct [sīlasampadā]). For a bhikkhu who is accomplished in virtue, bhikkhus, it is to be expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu who is accomplished in virtue develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view \{dependent on seclusion} (supported by detachment, by means of disengagement [vivekanissita]), \{supported by dispassion} (based on fading of desire [virāganissita]), \{based on ending} (supported by cessation [nirodhanissita]), \{culminating in complete relinquishment} (ripening in release, culminating in letting go [vossaggapariṇāmī]); he develops right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness, dependent on seclusion, supported by dispassion, based on ending, culminating in complete relinquishment. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who is accomplished in virtue develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path extensively."

### 45.65

"One thing, bhikkhus, is greatly beneficial for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. What is that one thing? It is \{accomplishment in aspiration} (being accomplished in goal, interest, objectives, wholesome desire [chandasampadā]). For a bhikkhu who is accomplished in aspiration, bhikkhus, it is to be expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path."

### 45.66

"One thing, bhikkhus, is greatly beneficial for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. What is that one thing? It is \{accomplishment in self-development} (being accomplished in self-development [attasampadā]). For a bhikkhu who is accomplished in self-development, bhikkhus, it is to be expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path."

### 45.67

"One thing, bhikkhus, is greatly beneficial for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. What is that one thing? It is \{accomplishment in view} (with correct outlook, with correct belief [diṭṭhisampadā]). For a bhikkhu who is accomplished in view, bhikkhus, it is to be expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path."

### 45.68

"One thing, bhikkhus, is greatly beneficial for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. What is that one thing? It is \{accomplishment in diligence} (being accomplished in doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamādasampadā]). For a bhikkhu who is accomplished in diligence, bhikkhus, it is to be expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path."
