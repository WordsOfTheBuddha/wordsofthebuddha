"Bhikkhus, just as the dawn precedes and predicts the rising of the sun, so too does good friendship precede and predict the arising of the noble eightfold path for a bhikkhu. For a bhikkhu with good friends, it is expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the noble eightfold path.

How, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view supported by seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and leading to complete relinquishment … he develops right collectedness supported by seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and leading to complete relinquishment. Thus indeed, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu with good friends develops and extensively cultivates the noble eightfold path."
