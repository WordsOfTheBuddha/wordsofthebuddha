"Bhikkhus, there are these four knots. What four? The knot of craving (greediness, wanting, yearning [abhijjhā]), the knot of ill-will (aversion, anger, contempt, resentment [byāpāda]), the knot of \{adherence to rites and rituals} (clinging to precepts and practices [sīlabbataparāmāsa]) the knot of \{clinging to the idea that 'This is the truth'} (dogmatic attachment to views [idaṃsaccābhinivesa]). These are the four knots.

Bhikkhus, for the \{direct knowing} (experiential understanding [abhiññāya]), \{full understanding} (complete comprehension [pariññāya]), \{complete exhaustion} (gradual and complete wearing away [parikkhaya]), and for \{giving up} (letting go, abandoning [pahāna]) of these four knots, the Noble Eightfold Path \{should be developed} (should be cultivated [bhāvetabba])."
