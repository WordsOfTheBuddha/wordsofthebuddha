"Bhikkhus, there are these four streams of merit, outflows of good, and supports for ease. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the Buddha — Indeed, the Blessed One is the Worthy One, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in wisdom and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be trained, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. This is the first stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the teachings of the Buddha — Indeed, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting verification, leading onward, to be personally experienced by the wise. This is the second stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with experiential confidence in the Sangha — Indeed, the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the upright way, practicing the knowledgeable way, practicing the proper way; these are the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals: this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. This is the third stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

Further again, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is wise, endowed with wisdom that discerns the arising and passing away of phenomena, noble and penetrative, leading to the complete ending of discontentment (suffering, stress). This is the fourth stream of merit, outflow of good, and support for ease.

These indeed, bhikkhus, are the four streams of merit, outflows of good, and supports for ease."
