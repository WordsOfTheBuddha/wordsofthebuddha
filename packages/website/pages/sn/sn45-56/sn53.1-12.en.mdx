At Sāvatthi.

There the Blessed One said:

"Bhikkhus, there are these four jhānas. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental states, with reflection and examination [of thoughts], born of seclusion, filled with joyful pleasure, enters and dwells in the first jhāna.

With the subsiding of reflection and examination [of thoughts], experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, devoid of reflection and examination, born of collectedness and filled with joyful pleasure, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna.

With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells equanimous and mindful, fully aware, experiencing ease (comfort, contentedness, happiness, pleasure [sukha]) with the body, which the Noble Ones describe as 'one who dwells equanimous, mindful, and at ease.' Thus, he enters and dwells in the third jhāna.

With the abandoning of both ease and discontentment (unsatisfactoriness, discomfort, unease [dukkha]), and with the subsiding of previous pleasure and displeasure, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensation, and with the purification of mindfulness by equanimity (mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]), he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna.

These, bhikkhus, are the four jhānas.

Just as the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the four jhānas slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the four jhānas slant, slope, and incline towards Nibbāna?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental states, with reflection and examination (of thoughts), born of seclusion, filled with joyful pleasure, enters and dwells in the first jhāna.

With the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, devoid of reflection and examination, born of collectedness and filled with joyful pleasure, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna.

With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells equanimous and mindful, fully aware, and experiences physical pleasure, which the Noble Ones describe as 'one who dwells happily, equanimous and mindful.' Thus, he enters and dwells in the third jhāna.

With the abandoning of ease (bliss) and suffering (discontentment, stress), and with the previous disappearance of joy and sorrow, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensation, and with the purity of equanimity and mindfulness, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna.

Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the four jhānas slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna."
