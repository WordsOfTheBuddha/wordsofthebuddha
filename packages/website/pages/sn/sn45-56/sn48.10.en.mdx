"Bhikkhus, these are the five faculties. Which five? The faculty of faith (confidence, conviction, trust [saddha]), energy (willpower, determination [vīriya]), mindfulness (awareness, presence [sati]), collectedness (stability of mind, mental composure [samādhi]) and wisdom (discernment [pañña]).

And what, bhikkhus, is the \{faculty of faith} (mental faculty of confidence, conviction, trust [saddhindriya])? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones has confidence, is convinced in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata, acknowledging: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant and perfectly awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, an unsurpassed guide for trainable individuals, a teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' This is called the faculty of faith.

And what, bhikkhus, is the \{faculty of energy} (mental faculty of willpower, determination [vīriya])? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for the giving up of unwholesome mental qualities and for the cultivation of wholesome mental qualities. With steadfast determination and unwavering effort, he generates desire, strives, arouses persistence, comprehends with his mind, and makes an effort, both to prevent the arising of unarisen harmful unwholesome mental qualities and to abandon existing ones, and to bring forth and develop unarisen wholesome mental qualities and enhance those that have arisen. This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of energy.

And what, bhikkhus, is the \{faculty of mindfulness} (mental faculty of awareness, presence [satindriya])? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is fully attentive, equipped with utmost mindfulness, able to recall and reflect upon things done and said long ago. He practices by observing the body in and of itself, with continuous effort, fully aware and being present, having removed \{craving and displeasure} (greediness and dissatisfaction, wanting and unhappiness, craving and aversion [abhijjhā + domanassa]) with regard to the world. Similarly, he applies this practice to feelings, mind, and mental qualities, dwelling as an observer who if fully aware and remains present, eradicating any worldly desires and displeasure. This is called the faculty of mindfulness.

And what, bhikkhus, is the \{faculty of collectedness} (mental faculty of stability of mind, mental composure [samādhindriya])? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones, having made letting go his basis, attains stability of mind, attains unification of mind. Having secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental qualities, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which includes reflection and examination [of thoughts], born of seclusion, filled with joyful pleasure. With the subsiding of reflection and examination [of thoughts], experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which is devoid of reflection and examination, born of collectedness and filled with joyful pleasure. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware, experiencing ease (comfort, contentedness, happiness, pleasure [sukha]) with the body, which the Noble Ones declare, 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful' - he enters and dwells in the third jhāna. With the letting go of both ease and discontentment (unsatisfactoriness, discomfort, unease [dukkha]), and with the subsiding of previous pleasure and displeasure, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensations, and with the purification of mindfulness by equanimity (mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhā]). This, bhikkhus, is called the faculty of collectedness.

And what, bhikkhus, is the \{faculty of wisdom} (mental faculty of discernment [paññindriya])? Here, bhikkhus, a disciple of the noble ones is wise, endowed with the wisdom which discerns the arising and passing away [of phenomena], a wisdom that is noble and penetrative, and leads directly to the \{complete exhaustion of suffering} (extinction of stress, termination of tension [dukkhakhaya]). Such a disciple truly understands, 'This is suffering', 'This is the arising of suffering', 'This is the exhaustion of suffering', and 'This is the way of practice leading to the exhaustion of suffering'. This is called the faculty of wisdom.

These, bhikkhus, are the five faculties."
