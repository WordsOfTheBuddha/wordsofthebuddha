Once, the Blessed One was staying among the Vajjians at Koṭi Village. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Because of not fully understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths, bhikkhus, both you and I have run and wandered this long course of samsara (transmigration), for a very long time.

What are these four? It is because of not fully understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of suffering, bhikkhus, that both you and I have run and wandered this long course of samsara, for a very long time. It is because of not fully understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering, that both you and I have run and wandered this long course of samsara, for a very long time. But now, bhikkhus, having fully understood and penetrated the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering; the craving for existence is severed, the entanglement of becoming is destroyed; there is no more rebirth."

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Well-gone One, the Teacher, further said:

"Due to not seeing as they truly are,
the Four Noble Truths;
we've roamed and wandered on,
through many a birth in samsara.

These truths now seen,
the net of becoming torn asunder;
the root of suffering cut,
no more is there rebirth."
