"Just as, bhikkhus, if a stick is thrown into the air, sometimes it lands on its base, and sometimes it lands on its tip; in the same way, bhikkhus, beings, hindered by the barrier of ignorance, and \{fettered by craving} (bound by desire [taṇhāsaṃyojana]), keep running and wandering in cyclic existence. Sometimes they go from this world to the next world, and sometimes they come [back] from the next world to this world. And what is the reason for this? It is because, bhikkhus, they have not seen the Four Noble Truths.

And what are these four? The Noble Truth of suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa]), the Noble Truth of the \{arising of suffering} (source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]), the Noble Truth of the \{ending of suffering} (ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]), the Noble Truth of the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to \{fully understand} (understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate): 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
