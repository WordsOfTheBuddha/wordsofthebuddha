"Bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'Without truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, without truly understanding the noble truth of the arising of suffering, without truly understanding the noble truth of the ending of suffering, and without truly understanding the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is not possible.

Just as, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'I will make a container out of acacia leaves, or pine leaves, or tamarind leaves, and with it, I will fetch water or carry palm fruit' — it is not possible; similarly, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'Without truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, the arising of suffering, the ending of suffering, and the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is not possible.

However, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'By truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, by truly understanding the noble truth of the arising of suffering, by truly understanding the noble truth of the ending of suffering, and by truly understanding the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is indeed possible.

Just as, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'I will make a container out of lotus leaves, or Butea leaves, or Hibiscus leaves, and with it, I will fetch water or carry palm fruit' — it is indeed possible; similarly, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'By truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, the arising of suffering, the ending of suffering, and the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — it is indeed possible.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to \{fully understand} (understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate): 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
