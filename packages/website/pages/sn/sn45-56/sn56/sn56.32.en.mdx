"Bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'Without \{fully understanding} (understanding the four noble truths in principle, then discerning them in each moment and then experientially penetrating them) the noble truth of suffering as it truly is, without fully understanding the noble truth of the arising of suffering as it truly is, without fully understanding the noble truth of the ending of suffering as it truly is, and without fully understanding the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering as it truly is, I will completely end suffering' — such a thing is not possible.

Just as, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'I will make a container out of \{acacia leaves} (small, delicate and feathery leaves [khadirapatta]), or \{pine leaves} (long, slender, needle like leaves), or \{tamarind leaves} (small, oval leaflets with a feathery, delicate texture), and with it, I will fetch water or carry palm fruit' — it is not possible; similarly, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'Without truly understanding the noble truth of suffering, the arising of suffering, the ending of suffering, and the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering, I will completely end suffering' — such a thing is not possible.

However, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'By fully understanding the noble truth of suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa]) as it truly is, by fully understanding the noble truth of the \{arising of suffering} (source of stress, appearance of discomfort [dukkhasamudaya]) as it truly is, by fully understanding the noble truth of the \{ending of suffering} (ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]) as it truly is, and by fully understanding the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering as it truly is, I will completely end suffering' — such a thing is indeed possible.

Just as, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'I will make a container out of \{lotus leaves} (large, circular leaves with a waxy, water-repellent surface), or \{butea leaves} (broad, trifoliate leaves, slightly leathery in texture), or \{hibiscus leaves} (medium-sized, deeply lobed leaves), and with it, I will fetch water or carry palm fruit' — it is indeed possible; similarly, bhikkhus, if someone were to say: 'By fully understanding the noble truth of suffering as it truly is, by fully understanding the noble truth of the arising of suffering as it truly is, by fully understanding the noble truth of the ending of suffering as it truly is, and fully understanding the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering as it truly is, I will completely end suffering' — such a thing is indeed possible.

Therefore, bhikkhus, effort should be made to \{fully understand} (understand in principle, then discern in each moment and then experientially penetrate): 'This is suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the arising of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the ending of suffering';
effort should be made to fully understand: 'This is the way of practice leading to the ending of suffering.'"
