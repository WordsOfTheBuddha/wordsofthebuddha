"These four things, bhikkhus, are true, unerring, and not otherwise. What four? 'This is suffering,' bhikkhus, this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise; 'This is the origin of suffering,' this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise; 'This is the cessation of suffering,' this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise; 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,' this is true, this is unerring, this is not otherwise. These, bhikkhus, are the four truths that are true, unerring, and not otherwise.

Therefore, bhikkhus, an effort should be made to understand: 'This is suffering.' An effort should be made to understand: 'This is the origin of suffering.' An effort should be made to understand: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' And an effort should be made to understand: 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'"
