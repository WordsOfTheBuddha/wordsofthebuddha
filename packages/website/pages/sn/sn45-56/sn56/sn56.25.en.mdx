"Bhikkhus, I proclaim the \{wearing away of the defilements} (depletion of the mental defilements, gradual exhaustion and elimination of the taints [āsava + khaya]) for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and does not see. What, bhikkhus, does one need to know and see for the wearing away of the defilements to occur?

'This is suffering (pain, discomfort, unease, unpleasantness, trouble, stress [dukkha]),' bhikkhus, by knowing and seeing this, the wearing away of the defilements occurs;

'This is the arising of suffering,' by knowing and seeing this, the wearing away of the defilements occurs;

'This is the \{end of suffering} (ending of discontentment, cessation of distress [dukkhanirodha]),' by knowing and seeing this, the wearing away of the defilements occurs;

'This is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering,' by knowing and seeing this, the wearing away of the defilements occurs. Thus, bhikkhus, for one who knows in this way and sees in this way, the wearing away of the defilements occurs.

Therefore, here, bhikkhus, one should undertake the task to understand 'This is suffering', 'This is the arising of suffering', 'This is the end of suffering', and 'This is the way of practice leading to the end of suffering.'"
