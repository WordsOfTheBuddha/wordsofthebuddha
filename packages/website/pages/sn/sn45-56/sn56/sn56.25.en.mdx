Discourse on the Elimination of Taints

"Bhikkhus, I proclaim the elimination of taints (defilements) for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and does not see. What, bhikkhus, does one need to know and see for the elimination of taints to occur? 'This is suffering,' bhikkhus, by knowing and seeing this, the elimination of taints occurs; 'This is the origin of suffering,' by knowing and seeing this, the elimination of taints occurs; 'This is the cessation of suffering,' by knowing and seeing this, the elimination of taints occurs; 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,' by knowing and seeing this, the elimination of taints occurs. Thus, bhikkhus, for one who knows in this way and sees in this way, the elimination of taints occurs.

Therefore, here, bhikkhus, one should undertake the task to understand 'This is suffering', 'This is the origin of suffering', 'This is the cessation of suffering', and 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'"
