"Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins in the past who were mighty and powerful, they all attained such might and power through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic ability. Any ascetics or brahmins in the future who will be mighty and powerful, they too will attain such might and power through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic ability. Any ascetics or brahmins in the present who are mighty and powerful, they too have attained such might and power through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic ability.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation) and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort, and develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort.

Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins in the past who were mighty and powerful, they all attained such might and power through the development and frequent practice of these very four bases of psychic ability. Any ascetics or brahmins in the future who will be mighty and powerful, they too will attain such might and power through the development and frequent practice of these very four bases of psychic ability. Any ascetics or brahmins in the present who are mighty and powerful, they too have attained such might and power through the development and frequent practice of these very four bases of psychic ability."
