"Bhikkhus, whoever in the past bhikkhus have, through the wearing away of the taints (defilements), attained the taint-free release of mind and release by wisdom, realizing it with direct knowledge in this very life and having attained it, abided therein, all of them did so through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic ability. Bhikkhus, whoever in the future bhikkhus will, through the wearing away of the taints, attain the taint-free release of mind and release by wisdom, realizing it with direct knowledge in this very life and having attained it, will abide therein, all of them will do so through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic ability. Bhikkhus, whoever at present bhikkhus are, through the wearing away of the taints, attaining the taint-free release of mind and release by wisdom, realizing it with direct knowledge in this very life and having attained it, are abiding therein, all of them are doing so through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic ability.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome desire) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort.
