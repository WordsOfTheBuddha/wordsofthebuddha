"Bhikkhus, there are these four bases of psychic ability. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort.

These, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic ability. It is because he has  developed and frequently practiced these four bases of psychic ability that the Tathāgata is called 'the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.'"
