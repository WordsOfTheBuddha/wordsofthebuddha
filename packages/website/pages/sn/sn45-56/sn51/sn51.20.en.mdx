"How, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic ability developed and frequently practiced so that they are of great fruit and great benefit? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort thus: 'My aspiration will not be too slack, nor too intense, nor inwardly inhibited, nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware: 'As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.' Thus with a mind that is clarified and unconfined, he develops a radiant mind."

Thus, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has developed and frequently practiced the four bases of psychic ability, through the wearing away of the taints, attains and dwells in the taintless release of mind and release by wisdom, having realized it with direct knowledge in this very life."
