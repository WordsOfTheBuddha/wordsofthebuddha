"Bhikkhus, through the development and frequent practice of the four bases of psychic ability, a bhikkhu, with the wearing away of the taints, realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.

What are these four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort, and develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort.

Bhikkhus, through the development and frequent practice of these four bases of psychic ability, a bhikkhu, with the wearing away of the taints, realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it."
