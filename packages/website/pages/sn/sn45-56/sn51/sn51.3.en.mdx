"Bhikkhus, these four bases of psychic ability, when developed and frequently practiced, are noble and leading to liberation; they lead one who practices rightly to the complete cessation of suffering.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort.

These, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic ability, which, when developed and frequently practiced, are noble and lead to liberation, guiding one who practices correctly to the complete cessation of suffering."
