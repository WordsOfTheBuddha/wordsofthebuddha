"Bhikkhus, I will teach you about psychic ability, the basis of psychic ability, the development of the bases of psychic ability, and the path leading to the development of the bases of psychic ability. Listen to this.

And what, bhikkhus, is psychic ability? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu experiences various kinds of psychic abilities—being one, he becomes many; being many, he becomes one; ... and even controls his body as far as the Brahmā world. This, bhikkhus, is called psychic ability.

And what, bhikkhus, is the basis of psychic ability? The path and practice that lead to the attainment of psychic ability — this, bhikkhus, is called the basis of psychic ability.

And what, bhikkhus, is the development of the bases of psychic ability? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective) and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort, and develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort — this, bhikkhus, is called the development of the bases of psychic ability.

And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to the development of the basis of psychic ability? It is this very Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right collectedness — this, bhikkhus, is called the path leading to the development of the basis of psychic ability."
