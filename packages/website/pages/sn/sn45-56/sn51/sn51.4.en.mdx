"Bhikkhus, when the four bases of psychic ability are developed and frequently practiced, they lead to complete disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, tranquility, direct knowing, full awakening, and Nibb훮na.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort. He develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort. And he develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort.

These, bhikkhus, are the four bases of psychic ability, which, when developed and frequently practiced, lead to complete disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, tranquility, direct knowing, full awakening, and Nibb훮na."
