"Bhikkhus, these four bases of psychic ability, when developed and frequently practiced, are of great fruit and benefit. And how, bhikkhus, are these four bases of psychic ability developed and frequently practiced so that they are of great fruit and benefit?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome desire) and accompanied by intentional effort — my aspiration will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly inhibited nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.

Similarly, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort — my energy will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly inhibited nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.

Similarly, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort — my mind will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly inhibited nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant.

Similarly, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort — my investigation will not be too slack, nor too tense, and it will not be inwardly inhibited nor outwardly scattered. He dwells continuously aware — as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. In this way, with an open and unenveloped mind, he develops a mind that is radiant. When these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, they are of great fruit and benefit.

When these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, one experiences various kinds of psychic abilities: being one, one becomes many; being many, one becomes one; one appears and disappears; one passes through walls, enclosures, and mountains as though through space; one dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; one walks on water without sinking as though on solid ground; one flies through the air cross-legged like a bird with wings; one touches and strokes with one's hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; and one controls the body as far as the Brahmā (God) world. ... (similar to [SN 51.11](/sn51.11))

When these four bases of psychic ability have been developed and frequently practiced in this way, through the wearing away of the taints, one realizes for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it."
