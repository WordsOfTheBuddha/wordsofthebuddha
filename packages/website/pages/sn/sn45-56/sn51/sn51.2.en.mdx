"Bhikkhus, for whomever the four bases of psychic ability are neglected, the noble way of practice leading to the complete ending of suffering is also neglected. For whomever the four bases of psychic ability are developed, the noble way of practice leading to the complete ending of suffering is also developed.

What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation) and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy (persistence) and accompanied by intentional effort, develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and accompanied by intentional effort, and develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (consideration, reflection, and examination) and accompanied by intentional effort.

Bhikkhus, for whomever these four bases of psychic ability are neglected, the noble way of practice leading to the complete ending of suffering is also neglected. For whomever these four bases of psychic ability are developed, the noble way of practice leading to the complete ending of suffering is also developed."
