"Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are accomplished in virtue (ethical conduct, moral integrity [sīla]), collectedness (stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]), wisdom (insight, knowing [ñāṇa]), liberation (release, deliverance, freedom, emancipation [vimutti]), and \{the wisdom and vision of liberation} (total understanding of emancipation, knowing and seeing of release, understanding and insight into liberation [vimutti + ñāṇa + dassana]) — I say that seeing such bhikkhus is of great benefit; listening to them is of great benefit; approaching them is of great benefit; attending upon them is of great benefit; recollecting them is of great benefit; and even going forth with [faith in] them is of great benefit. Why is that so? Because, bhikkhus, after hearing the Dhamma from such bhikkhus, one withdraws in two ways: by bodily seclusion and by mental seclusion. Dwelling thus secluded, one remembers and reflects on that Dhamma.

1. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu, dwelling thus secluded, remembers and reflects on that Dhamma, at that time, the \{awakening factor of mindfulness} (mindfulness of body, feelings, mind, mental qualities [satisambojjhaṅga]) is aroused in him. At that time, the bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of mindfulness. At that time, the awakening factor of mindfulness reaches fulfillment through cultivation (development, meditation [bhāvanā]) in him. Dwelling thus mindfully, he examines that Dhamma with wisdom, investigates, and thoroughly reflects upon it.

2. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu, dwelling thus mindfully, examines that Dhamma with wisdom, investigates, and thoroughly reflects upon it, at that time, \{awakening factor of investigation of mental qualities} (investigation of teachings, examination of states [dhammavicaya]) is aroused in him. At that time, the bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of investigation of mental qualities. At that time, the awakening factor of investigation of mental qualities reaches fulfillment through cultivation in him. For him, as he examines that Dhamma with wisdom, analyzing, and engaging in thorough reflection, unwavering energy is aroused.

3. Bhikkhus, at that time, when a bhikkhu, examining that Dhamma with wisdom, analyzing, and engaging in thorough reflection, unwavering energy is aroused in him. At that time, the \{awakening factor of energy} (persistence, willpower, determination as a factor of enlightenment [vīriyasambojjhaṅga]) is aroused in him. At that time, the bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of energy. At that time, the awakening factor of energy reaches fulfillment through cultivation in him. For him with energy aroused, non-material joy arises.

4. Bhikkhus, at that time, when non-material joy arises in a bhikkhu with energy aroused, the \{awakening factor of joy} (heartfelt joy, delight as a factor of enlightenment [pītisambojjhaṅga]) is aroused in him. At that time, the bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of joy. At that time, the awakening factor of joy reaches fulfillment through cultivation in him. For one with a joyful mind, the body becomes tranquil, and the mind becomes tranquil as well.

5. Bhikkhus, at that time, when the body of a bhikkhu with a joyful mind becomes tranquil and the mind becomes tranquil, the \{awakening factor of tranquility} (serenity, calmness, peacefulness as a factor of enlightenment [passaddhisambojjhaṅga]) is aroused in him. At that time, the bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of tranquility. At that time, the awakening factor of tranquility reaches fulfillment through cultivation in him. For one whose body is tranquil and at ease, the mind becomes collected.

6. Bhikkhus, at that time, when the mind of a bhikkhu, whose body is tranquil and at ease, becomes collected, the \{awakening factor of collectedness} (stability of mind, stillness of mind, mental composure [samādhi]) is aroused in him. At that time, the bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of collectedness. At that time, the awakening factor of collectedness reaches fulfillment through cultivation in him. With the mind thus collected, he thoroughly observes with equanimity.

7. Bhikkhus, at that time, when a bhikkhu thoroughly observes with equanimity the mind that is thus collected, the \{awakening factor of equanimity} (mental poise, mental balance, equipoise, non-reactivity, composure [upekkhāsambojjhaṅga]) is aroused in him. At that time, the bhikkhu develops the awakening factor of equanimity. At that time, the awakening factor of equanimity reaches fulfillment through cultivation in him.

Bhikkhus, when the seven awakening factors are developed and practiced often in this way, seven fruits and seven benefits can be expected. What are the seven fruits and seven benefits?

1. One attains final knowledge [of the complete wearing away of the taints] in this very life.

2. If not in this very life, then one attains final knowledge at the time of death.

3. If one does not attain final knowledge in this very life, and if one does not attain final knowledge at the time of death, then with the complete wearing away of the five lower fetters, one becomes an attainer of final Nibbāna in-between.

4. If one does not attain final knowledge in this very life, and if one does not attain final knowledge at the time of death, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna in-between, then with the complete wearing away of the five lower fetters, one becomes an attainer of final Nibbāna upon landing [in the next life].

5. If one does not attain final knowledge in this very life, and if one does not attain final knowledge at the time of death, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna in-between, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna upon landing, then with the complete wearing away of the five lower fetters, one becomes an attainer of final Nibbāna without effort.

6. If one does not attain final knowledge in this very life, and if one does not attain final knowledge at the time of death, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna in-between, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna upon landing, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna without effort, then with the complete wearing away of the five lower fetters, one becomes an attainer of final Nibbāna with effort.

7. If one does not attain final knowledge in this very life, and if one does not attain final knowledge at the time of death, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna in-between, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna upon landing, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna without effort, and if one does not become an attainer of final Nibbāna with effort, then with the complete wearing away of the five lower fetters, one becomes one bound upstream (a non-returner), heading towards the Akaniṭṭha (the highest of the Pure Abodes) realm.

Bhikkhus, when the seven awakening factors are developed and practiced often in this way, these seven fruits and seven benefits can be expected."
