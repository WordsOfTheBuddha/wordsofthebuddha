"Bhikkhus, just as the dawn precedes and predicts the rising of the sun, so too does accomplishment in virtue precede and predict the arising of the noble eightfold path for a bhikkhu. For a bhikkhu accomplished in virtue, it is expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the noble eightfold path.

For a bhikkhu accomplished in interest, it is expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the noble eightfold path.

For a bhikkhu accomplished in self-development, it is expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the noble eightfold path.

For a bhikkhu accomplished in view, it is expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the noble eightfold path.

For a bhikkhu accomplished in diligence, it is expected that he will develop and extensively cultivate the noble eightfold path."
