"Bhikkhus, these are the five faculties. Which five? The faculty of confidence (faith), persistence (energy), mindfulness, collectedness (concentration) and wisdom.

Among these, bhikkhus, when the five faculties are fully developed, one is an Arahant (perfectly enlightened). Those who are lesser in the development of these faculties are practicing for the realization of the fruit of Arahantship. Those milder still are non-returners; those even milder are practicing for the fruit of non-returning. Those milder still are once-returners; those even milder are practicing for the fruit of once-returning. Those milder still are stream-enterers (awakened to the truth of enlightenment); those even milder are practicing for the fruit of stream-entry.

If anyone, bhikkhus, is completely devoid of these five faculties, I declare that such a person stands outside, in the faction of the ordinary person."
