At SƒÅvatthi.

"Whether in the past, present, or future, bhikkhus, all those arahants and perfectly enlightened ones have truly understood the four noble truths as they really are. And what are these four? The noble truth of suffering (discontentment, stress), the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. Just as those in the past have fully understood these truths, so will those in the future, and so do those in the present.

Therefore, bhikkhus, an effort should be made to understand: 'This is suffering.' An effort should be made to understand: 'This is the origin of suffering.' An effort should be made to understand: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' And, an effort should be made to understand: 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'"
