At SƒÅvatthi.

Once, while sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Here, venerable sir, when I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind: 'There are few beings in the world who, having obtained great wealth, neither become arrogant nor negligent, do not become obsessed with sensual pleasures, and do not act wrongly towards others. But there are far more beings in the world who, having obtained great wealth, become arrogant and even negligent, obsessed with sensual pleasures, and act wrongly towards others.'"

"That is how it is, great king, that is how it is, great king. There are indeed few beings in the world who, having obtained great wealth, neither become arrogant nor negligent, do not become obsessed with sensual pleasures, and do not act wrongly towards others. But there are far more beings in the world who, having obtained great wealth, become arrogant and even negligent, obsessed with sensual pleasures, and act wrongly towards others."

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken, the Well-Gone One further said this:

"Enamoured by sensual pleasures,
Greedy, infatuated with desires;
They do not realize they have gone too far,
Like deer that enters the trap laid out;
Afterwards, it becomes painful for them,
For the result of their actions is bad."
