Thus have I heard—At At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's park.

Then Māra (embodiment of all forces that keeps beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth [māra]) the Evil One approached the Blessed One; having approached, he recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:

"One with children delights because of children,
one with cattle delights in the same way because of cattle;
A person's delight is due to acquisitions (attachment, taking as mine, appropriation, sense of ownership, identification [upadhi]),
without acquisitions, one does not delight."

[The Blessed One]: "One with children sorrows (grieves [socati]) because of children,
one with cattle sorrows in the same way because of cattle;
A person's sorrow is due to acquisitions,
without acquisitions, one does not sorrow."

Then Māra the Evil One, thinking, "The Blessed One knows me, the Well-Gone One knows me," dejected and disappointed, disappeared right there.
