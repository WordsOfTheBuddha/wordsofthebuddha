At Sāvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"For those whom the teachings are \{not fully comprehended} (not fully understood, not personally known [appaṭividitā = na + paṭividitā]),
they're led by \{others' views} (by another's doctrine, by the philosophical beliefs of others [paravādesu = para + vādesu]);
They do not awaken from sleep,
it is time for them to awaken."

[The Blessed One]: "For those whom the teachings are \{well comprehended} (fully understood, personally known [suppaṭividitā = su + paṭividitā]),
are not led by by others' views;
They are awakened, fully comprehending,
faring evenly (balanced, with peace, with tranquility [sama]) amidst the uneven path."
