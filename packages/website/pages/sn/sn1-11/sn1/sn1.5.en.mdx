commentary: |
    When the deity asks how many should one cut off and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five lower fetters of self-identity views, doubt, attachment to rites and rituals, sensual desire, and ill-will. One needs to cut these off.

    When the deity asks how many should one abandon and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five higher fetters of desire for fine-material existence, desire for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. One needs to abandon these.
    
    When the deity asks how many should one develop and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five faculties of confidence (faith), persistence (energy), mindfulness, collectedness (concentration), and wisdom. One needs to develop these.
    
    When the deity asks how many clingings should one overcome and the Buddha replies with five, this is referring to the five clinging aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. One needs to overcome these. When one has overcome these five clingings, one is said to have crossed over the flood of suffering.

At SƒÅvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity spoke this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"How many should one cut off, how many should one abandon,
how many further should one develop;
When a bhikkhu has overcome how many clingings,
is he said to be one who has crossed over the flood?"

[The Blessed One]: "Five should one cut off, five should one abandon,
five further should one develop;
When a bhikkhu has overcome five clingings,
he is said to be one who has crossed over the flood."
