At SƒÅvatthi.

While standing to one side, that deity spoke this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:

"How many should one cut off, how many should one abandon,
how many further should one develop;
When a bhikkhu has overcome how many clingings,
is he said to be one who has crossed over the flood?"

[The Blessed One]: "Five should one cut off, five should one abandon,
five further should one develop;
When a bhikkhu has overcome five clingings,
he is said to be one who has crossed over the flood."
