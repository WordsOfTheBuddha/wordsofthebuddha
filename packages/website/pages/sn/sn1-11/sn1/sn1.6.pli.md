commentary: |
  When the deity asks how many are asleep among those awake and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the five lower fetters of self-identity view, doubt, adherence to rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill-will. These fetters keep one "asleep" even in the presence of wisdom.

  When the deity asks how many are awake among those asleep and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the five spiritual faculties of confidence (faith), energy, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. These faculties keep one "awake" and mindful even in the midst of ignorance.

  When the deity asks by how many is the dust stirred up and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the five hindrances of sensual desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt. These hindrances cloud the mind with impurities.

  When the deity asks by how many is it purified and the Buddha replies with five, this refers to the same five spiritual faculties — confidence, energy, mindfulness, collectedness, and wisdom. These faculties purify the mind, leading to clarity and liberation.

Ekamantaṁ ṭhitā kho sā devatā bhagavato santike imaṁ gāthaṁ abhāsi:

“Kati jāgarataṁ suttā,
kati suttesu jāgarā;
Katibhi rajamādeti,
katibhi parisujjhatī”ti.

“Pañca jāgarataṁ suttā,
pañca suttesu jāgarā;
Pañcabhi rajamādeti,
pañcabhi parisujjhatī”ti.
