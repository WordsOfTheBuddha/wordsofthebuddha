    <CardGrid items={[{"title":"Devatāsaṁyutta - Linked Discourses With Deities","description":"The \"Linked Discourses With Deities\" features dialogues between the Buddha and various deities. Typically, a deity approaches the Buddha at the monastery in Sāvatthī, illuminating the night with their presence. They pose questions or offer verses that range from praise and reflection to challenges and riddles. The Buddha responds by elevating the discourse to a higher level of understanding. These discourses illustrate the Buddha's role as a teacher, even to deities, emphasizing that deities, despite their elevated status, seek wisdom from the Buddha. The themes of these conversations vary widely, offering insights that range from simple reflections to profound teachings.","id":"sn1","path":"/sn/sn1-11/","counts":{"en":6,"pli":6}},{"title":"Kosalasaṁyutta - Linked Discourses With King Pasenadi of Kosala","description":"The \"Linked Discourses With King Pasenadi of Kosala\" centers on King Pasenadi of Kosala, a figure who emerges in the early texts as both complex and relatable. Pasenadi is portrayed with his flaws and follies, yet also with deep devotion and a capacity for growth. These discourses often involve substantial prose narratives, depicting the king's struggles to reconcile his royal duties—amidst spies, sacrifices, punishments, and wars—with his commitment to the Dhamma. Queen Mallikā, a key figure in Pasenadi's spiritual journey, also appears, notably in [SN 3.8](/sn3.8), where she boldly challenges the king. This collection provides a rich exploration of the challenges faced by a ruler striving to uphold the Dhamma in the complex world of royal life.","id":"sn3","path":"/sn/sn1-11/","counts":{"en":4,"pli":4}},{"title":"Akkosa sutta - Insult","description":"A brahmin approaches the Buddha and abuses and insults him.
