At Sāvatthi.

Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was accustomed to eating rice by the bucket.

Then, after his meal, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Buddha, huffing and puffing (breathing heavily). He bowed and then sat down to one side.

Observing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after his meal, the Buddha, on that occasion, recited this verse:

"When a man is always mindful,
knowing moderation in eating,
his discomfort fades,
and he ages slowly, taking care of his life."

Now at that time the brahmin student Sudassana was standing behind the king.

King Pasenadi then addressed him: "Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha's presence and recite it to me whenever I am presented with a meal. I'll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred kahāpaṇas (currency at the time) for you."

"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Sudassana. He memorized the verse in the Buddha's presence and recited it whenever the king was presented with a meal:

"When a man is always mindful,
knowing moderation in eating,
his discomfort fades,
and he ages slowly, taking care of his life."

Gradually, the king got used to having no more than a pint of rice. After some time, King Pasenadi's body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, he then expressed this inspired utterance:

"Truly, the Buddha has shown compassion towards me in both ways: for the benefit in this life and for the future."
