    <CardGrid items={[{"title":"Nidānasaṁyutta - Linked Discourses on Causation","description":"The \"Linked Discourses on Causation\" contains discourses on dependent co-arising (paṭiccasamuppāda). Dependent co-arising presents a series of conditional links laying out the process of becoming and the arising of suffering. These teachings explore the interdependent nature of existence, illustrating how one condition leads to another in a chain of causation. By examining the causes and conditions that give rise to suffering, these discourses offer insights into the nature of reality and the conditions for liberation.","id":"sn12","path":"/sn/sn12-21/","counts":{"en":8,"pli":8}},{"title":"Nakhasikhā sutta - Tip Of The Fingernail","description":"For a person attained to right view, the suffering that remains is only a small amount compared to the suffering that has been exhausted and consumed.","id":"sn13.1","path":"/sn/sn12-21/"},{"title":"Dhātusaṁyutta - Linked Discourses on the Elements","description":"The \"Linked Discourses on the Elements\" contains discourses exploring elements shaping experience, with a focus on the six sensory elements — eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. These elements are examined for their role in generating contact, perception, and feeling, showing how sensory experience drives attachment and aversion. Other discourses address mental elements (e.g., forgetful, reckless, mindful) and the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and air — representing the basic physical structure of existence.","id":"sn14","path":"/sn/sn12-21/","counts":{"en":31,"pli":31}},{"title":"Anamataggasaṁyutta - Linked Discourses on the Inconceivable Beginning","description":"The \"Linked Discourses on the Inconceivable Beginning\" contains discourses exploring the beginningless nature of saṁsāra, the cycle of birth and death. These teachings challenge the idea of a first point in time, suggesting that saṁsāra has no discernible origin. By examining the endless cycle of rebirth and the causes of suffering, these discourses offer insights into the nature of existence and the conditions for liberation.","id":"sn15","path":"/sn/sn12-21/","counts":{"pli":14,"en":14}},{"title":"Lābhasakkārasaṁyutta - Linked Discourses on Acquisitions and Respect","description":"The \"Linked Discourses on Acquisitions and Respect\"  contain teachings on the danger of acqusitions, respect, and popularity for spiritual practitioners. The Buddha emphasizes how these worldly rewards are harsh, bitter, severe, and obstructive, leading to complacency, attachment, and spiritual downfall. Through vivid similes — such as comparing acquisitions and respect to a fisherman's baited hook — the discourses highlight how even accomplished practitioners can become ensnared if they relish praise and recognition.","id":"sn17","path":"/sn/sn12-21/","counts":{"en":4,"pli":4}}]} />
