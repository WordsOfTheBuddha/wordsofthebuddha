"Bhikkhus, the arising, persistence, production, and appearance of the \{earth element} (whatever internal or external that is solid, hard, resistant, appears stable and supporting, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [pathavīdhātu]) is the arising of suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]), the persistence of disease (illness, sickness [roga]), and the appearance of aging and death.

The arising, persistence, production, and appearance of the \{water element} (whatever internal or external, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, which can be considered as belonging to oneself, and can be clung to [āpodhātu]) is the arising of suffering, the persistence of disease, and the appearance of aging and death.

The arising, persistence, production, and appearance of the \{fire element} (whatever internal or external that is hot, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [tejodhātu]) is the arising of suffering, the persistence of disease, and the appearance of aging and death.

The arising, persistence, production, and appearance of the \{air element} (whatever internal or external that is airy, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, which can be considered as belonging to oneself and can be clung to [vāyodhātu]) is the arising of suffering, the persistence of disease, and the appearance of aging and death.

But, bhikkhus, the \{gradual ending} (cessation, termination [nirodha]), settling (calming, conciliation, subsiding [vūpasama]), and \{passing away} (disappearing, vanishing, subsiding [atthaṅgama]) of the earth element is the ending of suffering, the settling of disease, and the passing away of aging and death.
