title: Dutiyabāhiraphassanānattasutta - Diversity Of External Contacts (Second)
description: The Buddha describes how diversity of acquisitions does not lead to the arising of diversity of quests, fevers, desires, sensations, contacts, intentions, perceptions, and elements. Rather, diversity of elements leads to the arising of diversity of perceptions, intentions, contacts, sensations, desires, fevers, quests, and acquisitions.

At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), \{diverse perceptions} (variety of conceptions, manifold notions [saññānānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse perceptions, \{diverse intentions} (volitions, purposes, thoughts [saṅkappanānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse intentions, \{diverse contacts} (sense impingements, raw experiences, experiences of coming into contact with [phassanānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse contacts, \{diverse sensations} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experiences, feelings, second of the five aggregates [vedanānānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse sensations, \{diverse desires} (inclinations, wishes, impulses, interests, goals, objectives, aspirations [chandanānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse desires, \{diverse fevers} (burning passion, strong desires, fascination, infatuations, attachments, lust [pariḷāhanānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse fevers, \{diverse quests} (searches, inquiries, pursuits [pariyesanānānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse quests, \{diverse acquisitions} (gains, profit, attainments, objects of possession [lābhanānatta]) arise.
Diversity of quests does not arise dependent on diversity of acquisitions,
diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on diversity of quests,
diversity of desires does not arise dependent on diversity of fevers,
diversity of sensations does not arise dependent on diversity of desires,
diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on diversity of sensations,
diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on diversity of contacts,
diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on diversity of intentions,
and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on diversity of perceptions.

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on diversity of elements, diverse perceptions arise,
that dependent on the diversity of perceptions, diverse intentions arise,
that dependent on the diversity of intentions, diverse contacts arise,
that dependent on the diversity of contacts, diverse sensations arise,
that dependent on the diversity of sensations, diverse desires arise,
that dependent on the diversity of desires, diverse fevers arise,
that dependent on the diversity of fevers, diverse quests arise,
that dependent on the diversity of quests, diverse acquisitions arise,
that diversity of quests does not arise dependent on diversity of acquisitions,
that diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on diversity of quests,
that diversity of desires does not arise dependent on diversity of fevers,
that diversity of sensations does not arise dependent on diversity of desires,
that diversity of contacts does not arise dependent on diversity of sensations,
that diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on diversity of contacts,
that diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on diversity of intentions,
and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on diversity of perceptions?
