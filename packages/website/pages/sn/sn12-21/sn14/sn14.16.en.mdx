### Inferior Disposition

"Bhikkhus, beings come together and associate \{according to disposition} (in line with their mental qualities or inclinations [dhātuso]). Those with an \{inferior disposition} (with bad inclination, with low tendencies [hīnādhimuttika]) come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition. In the past, too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition came together and associated with those of an inferior disposition.

In the future, too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition.

Even now, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition.

Bhikkhus, just as excrement (dung, faeces [gūtha]) comes together and fits with excrement; urine comes together and fits with urine; saliva (spit [kheḷa]) comes together and fits with saliva; pus (suppuration [pubba]) comes together and fits with pus; blood comes together and fits with blood; so too, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition. In the past, too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition came together and associated with those of an inferior disposition. In the future, too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition. Even now, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition.

### Good Disposition

Bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with a \{good disposition} (whose inclinations are good, intent on good [kalyāṇādhimuttika]) come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition. In the past, too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated according to disposition. Those with a good disposition came together and associated with those of a similar good disposition.

In the future, too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate according to disposition. Those with a good disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition. Even now, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with a good disposition come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition.

Bhikkhus, just as milk comes together and mixes with milk; oil with oil; ghee (clarified butter [sappi]) with ghee; honey with honey; and jaggery (molasses [phāṇita]) with jaggery; so too, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with a good disposition come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition. In the past, too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated according to disposition. Those with a good disposition came together and associated with those of a similar good disposition. In the future, too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate according to disposition. Those with a good disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition. Even now, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with a good disposition come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition.

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken, the Well-Gone One further said this:

### Verse

"From association (mingling, mixing, contact, intimacy, touch, entanglement [saṃsagga]), craving (desire [vanatha]) arises,
through non-association, it \{is cut-off} (is severed, ceases to exist, is broken [chijjati]);
Just as one riding on a small piece of wood,
would sink in the mighty ocean.

So by consorting with a \{lazy person} (a procrastinating, inactive person, indolent [kusīta]),
even a virtuous person sinks;
Therefore, one should \{steer clear of} (avoid, shun [parivajjati]),
a lazy person who is \{weak in effort} (low in energy, lacking in endurance [hīnavīriya]).

\{Dwell together} (keep company [sahāvasa]) with the wise,
with the \{noble ones} (an ethically noble person, an awakened being [ariya]) who dwell in seclusion (separated, withdrawn, detached [pavivitta]);
With meditators (yogis [jhāyi]) who are resolute (intent, determined [pahitatta]) on their goal,
who are continuously (regularly, reliably [nicca]) \{with energy aroused} (with initiative [āraddhavīriya])."
