At Sāvatthi.

"I will teach you the diversity of elements, bhikkhus. Listen to it and pay close attention, I will speak."

"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

"And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements?

The \{eye element} (faculty of vision [cakkhudhātu]), the \{objects of vision} (form element, materials [rūpadhātu]), and the \{eye-consciousness element} (visual awareness [cakkhuviññāṇadhātu]);
the \{ear element} (hearing faculty [sotadhātu]), the sounds (auditory element, noises, voices [saddadhātu]), and the \{ear-consciousness element} (awareness of sounds [sotaviññāṇadhātu]);
the \{nose element} (faculty of perceiving odors [ghānadhātu]), the odors (odor element, smells, scents, aroma, fragrances [gandhadhātu]), and the \{nose-consciousness element} (awareness of smells [ghānaviññāṇadhātu]);
the \{tongue element} (faculty of perceiving taste [jivhādhātu]), the tastes (taste element, flavors [rasadhātu]), and the \{tongue-consciousness element} (awareness of tastes [jivhāviññāṇadhātu]);
the \{body element} (faculty of perceiving tactile sensations [kāyadhātu]), the \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and the \{body-consciousness element} (awareness of physical sensations [kāyaviññāṇadhātu]);
the mind (mentality [manodhātu]), the \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]), and the \{mind-consciousness element} (knowing, mental awareness [manoviññāṇadhātu]).

This, bhikkhus, is called the diversity of elements."
