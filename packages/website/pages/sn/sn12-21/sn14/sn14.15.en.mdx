At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagaha, on the Vulture Peak Mountain. At that time, the Venerable Sāriputta was walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Mahākassapa was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Anuruddha was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāniputta was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Upāli was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; the Venerable Ānanda was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One; and Devadatta was also walking back and forth with many bhikkhus not far from the Blessed One.

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you see Sāriputta walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are \{of great wisdom} (very wise [mahāpaññā]). Do you see Moggallāna walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus have great \{supernormal powers} (well-developed psychic abilities [mahiddhika]). Do you see Kassapa walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are ascetics of austere practices. Do you see Anuruddha walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus have \{supernormal vision} (clairvoyance, divine eye [dibbacakkhu]). Do you see Puṇṇa Mantāniputta walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are teachers of the Dhamma. Do you see Upāli walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are masters of the discipline (code of monastic discipline rules, training [vinaya]). Do you see Ānanda walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus are very learned. Do you see Devadatta walking back and forth with many bhikkhus?"

"Yes, venerable sir."

"All these bhikkhus have \{evil desires} (yearnings that produce harm [pāpiccha])."

"Bhikkhus, beings come together and associate \{according to disposition} (in line with their mental qualities or inclinations [dhātuso]). Those with an \{inferior disposition} (with bad inclination, with low tendencies [hīnādhimuttika]) come together and associate with those of similar inferior disposition; those of a \{good disposition} (whose inclinations are good, intent on good [kalyāṇādhimuttika]) come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition."

"In the past, too, bhikkhus, beings came together and associated according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition came together and associated with those of an inferior disposition; those with a good disposition came together and associated with those of a similar good disposition. In the future, too, bhikkhus, beings will come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition; those with a good disposition will come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition. Even now, bhikkhus, beings come together and associate according to disposition. Those with an inferior disposition come together and associate with those of a similar inferior disposition; those with a good disposition come together and associate with those of a similar good disposition."
