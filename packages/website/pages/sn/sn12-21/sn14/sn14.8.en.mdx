At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), there arises a \{diversity of perceptions} (variety of conceptions, manifold notions [saññānānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises a \{diversity of intentions} (volitions, purposes, thoughts [saṅkappanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of intentions, there arises a \{diversity of desires} (inclinations, wishes, impulses, interests, goals, objectives, aspirations [chandanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of desires, there arises a \{diversity of fevers} (burning passion, strong desires, fascination, infatuations, attachments, lust [pariḷāhanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of fevers, there arises a \{diversity of quests} (searches, inquiries, pursuits [pariyesanānānatta]).
Diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on diversity of quests,
diversity of desires does not arise dependent on diversity of fevers,
diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on diversity of desires,
diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on diversity of intentions,
and diversity of elements does not arise dependent on diversity of perceptions.

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises a diversity of perceptions,
that dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises a diversity of intentions,
that dependent on the diversity of intentions, there arises a diversity of desires,
that dependent on the diversity of desires, there arises a diversity of fevers,
that dependent on the diversity of fevers, there arises a diversity of quests,
that diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on the diversity of quests,
that diversity of desires does not arise dependent on the diversity of fevers,
that diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on the diversity of desires,
that diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on the diversity of intentions,
that diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of perceptions?

Thus, bhikkhus, dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises the diversity of perceptions. Dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises the diversity of intentions. Dependent on the diversity of intentions, there arises the diversity of desires. Dependent on the diversity of desires, there arises the diversity of fevers. Dependent on the diversity of fevers, there arises the diversity of quests. Diversity of fevers does not arise dependent on the diversity of quests. Diversity of desires does not arise dependent on the diversity of fevers. Diversity of intentions does not arise dependent on the diversity of desires. Diversity of perceptions does not arise dependent on the diversity of intentions. And diversity of elements does not arise dependent on the diversity of perceptions."
