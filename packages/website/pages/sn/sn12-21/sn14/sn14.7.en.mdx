At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), \{diverse perceptions} (variety of conceptions, manifold notions [saññānānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse perceptions, diverse intentions (volitions, purposes, thoughts [saṅkappa]) arise,
dependent on diverse intentions, diverse desires (inclination, wish, impulse, interest, goal, objective, aspiration [chanda]) arise,
dependent on diverse desires, diverse fevers (burning passion, strong desire, fascination, infatuation, attachment, lust [pariḷāha]) arise,
dependent on diverse fevers, diverse quests (searching, seeking, inquiring [pariyesanā]) arise.

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how, bhikkhus, does the diversity of elements give rise to diverse perceptions,
and dependent on diverse perceptions, how do diverse intentions arise,
and dependent on diverse intentions, how to diverse desires arise,
and dependent on diverse desires, how do diverse fevers arise,
and dependent on diverse fevers, how to diverse quests arise?
