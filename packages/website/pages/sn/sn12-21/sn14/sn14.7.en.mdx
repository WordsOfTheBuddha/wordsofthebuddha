At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), \{diverse perceptions} (variety of conceptions, manifold notions [saññānānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse perceptions, \{diverse intentions} (volitions, purposes, thoughts [saṅkappanānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse intentions, \{diverse desires} (inclinations, wishes, impulses, interests, goals, objectives, aspirations [chandanānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse desires, \{diverse fevers} (burning passion, strong desires, fascination, infatuations, attachments, lust [pariḷāhanānatta]) arise,
dependent on diverse fevers, \{diverse quests} (searches, inquiries, pursuits [pariyesanānānatta]) arise.

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, diverse perceptions arise,
that dependent on diverse perceptions, diverse intentions arise,
that dependent on diverse intentions, diverse desires arise,
that dependent on diverse desires, diverse fevers arise,
that dependent on diverse fevers, diverse quests arise?
