At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, I investigated (practiced, engaged in [acariṁ]) the gratification (satisfaction, pleasure, enjoyment, sweetness [assāda]) in the \{earth element} (whatever internal or external, belonging to oneself, that is solid, hard, resistant, stable, supporting, and clung to [pathavīdhātu]), and whatever gratification there is in the earth element, I \{directly experienced} (achieved [tadajjhagamā]) it.

Bhikkhus, I investigated the gratification in the \{fire element} (whatever internal or external, belonging to oneself, that is heat, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, and clung to [tejodhātu]), and whatever gratification there is in the fire element, I directly experienced it. As far as the gratification in the fire element goes, it has been thoroughly seen by me with wisdom.

Bhikkhus, as long as I did not \{experientially understand} (directly knew, realized [abbhaññāsi]), \{as they truly are} (as they have come to be, in reality [yathābhūta]), the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape in regard to these four elements, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening in this world with its deities, Māras, and Brahmās, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners.

But bhikkhus, when I experientially understood, as they truly are, the gratification as gratification, the drawback as drawback, and the escape as escape in regard to these four elements, only then did I claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening in this world with its deities, Māras, and Brahmās, among this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its kings and commoners.

Wisdom (insight, knowing [ñāṇa]) and vision (realization [dassana]) arose in me: 'My liberation is unshakable, this is my final birth, now there is no more \{renewed existence} (renewal of being, reappearance, rebirth, future life [punabbhava]).'"
