At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, whoever delights in the \{earth element} (whatever internal or external, belonging to oneself, that is solid, hard, resistant, stable, supporting, and clung to [pathavīdhātu]), delights in [what is subject to] suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]). Whoever delights in what is subject to suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering.

Whoever delights in the \{water element} (whatever internal or external, belonging to oneself, that is liquid, cohesive, flowing, binding, moist, and clung to [āpodhātu]), delights in what is subject to suffering. Whoever delights in what is subject to suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering.

Whoever delights in the \{fire element} (whatever internal or external, belonging to oneself, that is heat, fiery, transformative, warming, cooling, and clung to [tejodhātu]), delights in what is subject to suffering. Whoever delights in what is subject to suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering.

Whoever delights in the \{air element} (whatever internal or external, belonging to oneself, that is air, gaseous, moving, vibrating, wind-like, and clung to [vāyodhātu]), delights in what is subject to suffering. Whoever delights in what is subject to suffering, I say, is not freed from suffering.

But, bhikkhus, whoever does not delight in the earth element, does not delight in [what is subject to] suffering. Whoever does not delight in what is subject to suffering, I say, is freed from suffering.

Whoever does not delight in the water element, does not delight in what is subject to suffering. Whoever does not delight in what is subject to suffering, I say, is freed from suffering.

Whoever does not delight in the fire element, does not delight in what is subject to suffering. Whoever does not delight in what is subject to suffering, I say, is freed from suffering.

Whoever does not delight in the air element, does not delight in what is subject to suffering. Whoever does not delight in what is subject to suffering, I say, is freed from suffering."
