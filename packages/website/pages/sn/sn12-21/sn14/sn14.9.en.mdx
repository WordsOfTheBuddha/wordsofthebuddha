At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, \{dependent on} (contingent on, supported by, grounded on [paṭicca]) the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense elements [dhātunānatta]), there arises the \{diversity of perceptions} (variety of conceptions, manifold notions [saññānānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises the \{diversity of intentions} (volitions, purposes, thoughts [saṅkappanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of intentions, there arises the \{diversity of contacts} (sense impingements, raw experiences, experiences of coming into contact with [phassanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises the \{diversity of sensations} (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experiences, feelings, second of the five aggregates [vedanānānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of sensations, there arises the \{diversity of desires} (inclinations, wishes, impulses, interests, goals, objectives, aspirations [chandanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of desires, there arises the \{diversity of fevers} (burning passion, strong desires, fascination, infatuations, attachments, lust [pariḷāhanānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of fevers, there arises the \{diversity of quests} (searches, inquiries, pursuits [pariyesanānānatta]),
dependent on the diversity of quests, there arises the \{diversity of acquisitions} (gains, profit, attainments, objects of possession [lābhanānatta]).

And what is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.

And how is it, bhikkhus, that dependent on the diversity of elements, there arises the diversity of perceptions,
that dependent on the diversity of perceptions, there arises the diversity of intentions,
that dependent on the diversity of intentions, there arises the diversity of contacts,
that dependent on the diversity of contacts, there arises the diversity of sensations,
that dependent on the diversity of sensations, there arises the diversity of desires,
that dependent on the diversity of desires, there arises the diversity of fevers,
that dependent on the diversity of fevers, there arises the diversity of quests,
that dependent on the diversity of quests, there arises the diversity of acquisitions?"
