At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the \{diversity of elements} (varied and manifold sense impressions [dhātunānatta]). Listen to it, pay close attention, and I will speak.

And what, bhikkhus, is the diversity of elements? The \{objects of vision} (form element [rūpadhātu]), sounds (voices, noise, sound element [saddadhātu]), smells (odors [gandhadhātu]), tastes (flavors [rasadhātu]), \{physical sensations} (touch, tactile sensations, tangibles [phoṭṭhabbadhātu]), and \{mental objects} (mind objects, ideas, thoughts, mental phenomena [dhammadhātu]). This is called the diversity of elements.
