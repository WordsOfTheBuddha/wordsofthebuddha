At Sāvatthi.

Then the venerable Kaccānagotta went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side. Seated at one side, the venerable Kaccānagotta said to the Blessed One:

"'Right view, right view,' it is said, venerable sir. To what extent, venerable sir, is there right view?"

"The world, Kaccāna, for the most part depends on a duality — on the notion of existence and non-existence.

But for one who sees the arising of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, the notion of non-existence in regard to the world does not occur. And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, the notion of existence in regard to the world does not occur.

This world, Kaccāna, is for the most part bound by engagement, grasping, and insistence.

But one who does not approach, grasp, or insist upon any mental standpoint, adherence, or underlying tendency, who has no uncertainty or doubt that what arises is only suffering arising and what ceases is only suffering ceasing, his knowledge about this is independent of others.

In this way, Kaccāna, there is right view.

'Everything exists,' Kaccāna, this is one extreme.

'Everything does not exist,' this is the second extreme.

Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma by the middle way:

'With ignorance as condition, formations arise; with formations as condition, consciousness arises; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form arises; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases arise; with the six sense bases as condition, contact arises; with contact as condition, feeling arises; with feeling as condition, craving arises; with craving as condition, clinging arises; with clinging as condition, continued existence arises; with continued existence as condition, birth arises; with birth as condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise. Thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.

With the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of formations; with the cessation of formations, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of continued existence; with the cessation of continued existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus there is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.'"
