At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, possessions, respect, and popularity are painful, severe, and obstructive to the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from the yoke (freedom from bondage).

Just as, bhikkhus, a fisherman would throw a baited hook into a deep pool of water. A certain fish, with eyes only for the bait, would swallow it. Indeed, bhikkhus, that fish swallowing the hook has fallen into disaster and calamity and is to be dealt with as the fisherman wishes.

Bhikkhus, the term 'fisherman' is a designation for Māra the evil one. The term 'hook' is a designation for possessions, respect, and popularity. Any bhikkhu who relishes and longs for arisen possessions, respect, and popularity is called a bhikkhu who swallows the hook, who has fallen into disaster and calamity, and is to be dealt with as Māra the evil one wishes.

Thus, bhikkhus, possessions, respect, and popularity are painful, severe, and obstructive to the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from the yoke.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon arisen possessions, respect, and popularity, and arisen possessions, respect, and popularity will not occupy our minds.' Thus indeed, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."
