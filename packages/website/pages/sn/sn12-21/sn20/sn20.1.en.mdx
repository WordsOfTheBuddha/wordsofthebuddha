Thus I have heard - At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthi, at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.

There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus."

"Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

"Bhikkhus, just as whatever rafters (support beams, wooden framework of a thatched roof [gopānasī]) there are in a building with a peaked roof, all of them point towards the peak, \{converge upon} (unite, meet, connect [samosaraṇa]) at the peak, and are removed together with the removal of the peak — so too, bhikkhus, whatever unwholesome qualities there are, all of them have ignorance as their root, converge upon ignorance, and are eradicated with the eradication (extermination, destruction [samugghāta]) of ignorance.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will dwell diligently (doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]).' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
