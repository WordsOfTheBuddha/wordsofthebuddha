At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, suppose that in a place where these great rivers merge and converge — namely \{the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī} (five great rivers of ancient India that were significant for trade, agriculture, and cultural activities) — the water were to be exhausted and completely dried up, leaving only two or three drops remaining.

What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is greater: the water that has dried up and been exhausted, or the two or three drops that remain?

"Venerable sir, the water at the confluence that has been exhausted and depleted is indeed far greater. The two or three drops of water that remain are very little. Compared to the water that has been exhausted and depleted, the remaining drops do not amount to a hundredth part, nor a thousandth part, nor even a hundred-thousandth part."

"Just so, bhikkhus, for the disciple of the noble ones who has attained \{right view} (view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]), who has completely penetrated [the four noble truths], this much greater is the suffering (mild or intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkha]) that is exhausted and overcome; only a small (tiny, minute, insignificant [appamattaka]) amount remains. It does not come to a hundredth part, nor to a thousandth part, nor to a hundred-thousandth part of the former mass of suffering that is exhausted and overcome compared to this final state of having at most seven more existences. Thus great, bhikkhus, is the realization of the Dhamma; thus great is the \{attainment of the vision of the Dhamma} (acquiring insight into the nature of reality [dhammacakkhupaṭilābha])."
