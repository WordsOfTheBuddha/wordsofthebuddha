At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, suppose that in a place where these great rivers merge and converge — namely \{the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī} (five great rivers of ancient India that were significant for trade, agriculture, and cultural activities) — a person would draw out two or three drops of water.

What do you think, bhikkhus, which is greater: these two or three drops of water that have been drawn out, or the \{water at the confluence} (junction where waters converge [sambhejjaudaka])?"

"Venerable sir, the water at the confluence is indeed far greater. The two or three drops of water that have been drawn out are very little. Compared to the water at the confluence, these two or three drops do not amount to a hundredth part, nor a thousandth part, nor even a hundred-thousandth part."

"Just so, bhikkhus, for the disciple of the noble ones who has attained \{right view} (view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]), who has completely penetrated [the four noble truths], this much greater is the suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkha]) that is exhausted and overcome; only a small (tiny, minute, insignificant [appamattaka]) amount remains. It does not come to a hundredth part, nor to a thousandth part, nor to a hundred-thousandth part of the former mass of suffering that is exhausted and overcome compared to this final state of having at most seven more existences. Thus great, bhikkhus, is the realization of the Dhamma; thus great is the \{attainment of the vision of the Dhamma} (acquiring insight into the nature of reality [dhammacakkhupaṭilābha])."
