Thus have I heard - at one time, the Blessed One was residing in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi, at Anāthapiṇḍika's park.

Then the Blessed One, having taken a small amount of dust on the tip of a fingernail, addressed the bhikkhus: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more, this small amount of dust on the tip of the fingernail or this great earth?"

"Indeed, venerable sir, the great earth is more. The small amount of dust on the tip of the fingernail put by the Blessed One does not come to a hundredth part, nor to a thousandth part, nor to a hundred-thousandth part compared to the great earth."

"Just so, bhikkhus, for the disciple of the noble ones who has attained \{right view} (view that is in line with the Dhamma - teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [sammādiṭṭhi]), who has completely penetrated [the four noble truths], this much greater is the suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkha]) that is exhausted and overcome; only a small (tiny, minute, insignificant [appamattaka]) amount remains. It does not come to a hundredth part, nor to a thousandth part, nor to a hundred-thousandth part of the former mass of suffering that is exhausted and overcome compared to this final state of having at most seven more existences. Thus great, bhikkhus, is the realization of the Dhamma; thus great is the \{attainment of the vision of the Dhamma} (acquiring insight into the nature of reality [dhammacakkhupaṭilābha])."
