At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, acquisitions (gain, money, profit, possessions [lābhā]), respect (honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]), and popularity (fame, praise [siloka]) are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

"Here, bhikkhus, I know of a certain person by directly knowing their mind with my mind in this way: 'This venerable one would not, even for a golden bowl filled with powdered silver, intentionally speak a deliberate lie.' But then I see that person at a later time, overwhelmed by acquisitions, respect, and popularity, with a mind consumed by them, speaking a deliberate lie.

Thus, bhikkhus, acquisitions, respect, and popularity are harsh, bitter, and severe; they obstruct the attainment of the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon the arisen acquisitions, respect and popularity, and we will not let the arisen acquisitions, respect, and popularity continue to occupy (obsessing, controlling [pariyādāya]) our minds.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves."
