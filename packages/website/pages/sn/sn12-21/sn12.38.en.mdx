Discourse on Intention

"Whatever one intends, plans, and has an underlying tendency (attachment, clinging, holding on) towards, bhikkhus, this becomes a basis for the continuance of consciousness. When there is a basis, there is a support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is established and comes to growth, there arises the future renewal of being. With the future renewal of being as condition, future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. Thus is the origin of this entire mass of suffering.

If one does not intend, does not plan, but still has an underlying tendency towards, bhikkhus, this becomes a basis for the continuance of consciousness. When there is a basis, there is a support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is established and comes to growth, there arises the future renewal of being. With the future renewal of being as condition, future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. Thus is the origin of this entire mass of suffering.

However, bhikkhus, when one neither intends, nor plans, nor has an underlying tendency towards, there is no basis for the continuance of consciousness. With no basis, there is no support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is not established and does not come to growth, there is no future renewal of being. With no future renewal of being, there is no future birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Thus, the cessation of this entire mass of suffering occurs."
