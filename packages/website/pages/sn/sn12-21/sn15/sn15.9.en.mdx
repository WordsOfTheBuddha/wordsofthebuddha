At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, this \{cyclic existence} (wandering from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]) is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by ignorance (fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]) and fettered by craving (wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]), run on and wander in this cycle of existence.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a stick were thrown in the air. Sometimes it lands on its base, sometimes in the middle, and sometimes on its tip. In the same way, bhikkhus, beings obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, continue to run and wander in this cycle of existence. Sometimes they go from this world to the other world, and sometimes they come from the other world to this world.

For what reason? Bhikkhus, this cyclic existence is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, run on and wander in this cycle of existence. For such a long time, bhikkhus, you have experienced suffering (mild suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkha]), agony (intense suffering, anguish [tibba]), and calamity (disaster [byasana]), the cemetery (charnel ground [kaṭasī]) has been filled up with your bones. Therefore, bhikkhus, it is enough \{to become disenchanted} (to become disillusioned [nibbindituṃ]), \{to become detached} (to become dispassionate [virajjituṁ]) and \{to become free from} (to be liberated from [vimuccituṃ]) \{all conditions} (all formations, all activities, all fabrications [sabbasaṅkhāra])."
