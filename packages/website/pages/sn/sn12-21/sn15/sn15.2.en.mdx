At Sāvatthi.

"Bhikkhus, this \{cyclic existence} (wandering from one state of existence to another, the cycle of birth and death, moving on continuously [saṁsāra]) is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by ignorance (fundamental unawareness or misunderstanding of the true nature of reality, not experientially understanding the four noble truths [avijjā]) and fettered by craving (wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇhā]), run on and wander in this cycle of existence.

Suppose, bhikkhus, a man were to reduce this great earth to small clay balls, each the size of a jujube kernel, and scatter them, marking each one: 'This one is my father; this one is my father's father,' and so on. Even so, bhikkhus, the sequence of that man's fathers would still remain incomplete before this great earth was completely exhausted and used up.

For what reason? Bhikkhus, this cyclic existence is without a discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned for beings who, obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, run on and wander in this cycle of existence. For such a long time, bhikkhus, you have experienced suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]), agony (intense suffering, anguish [tibba]), and calamity (disaster [byasana]), the cemetery (charnel ground [kaṭasī]) has been filled up with your bones. Therefore, bhikkhus, it is enough \{to become disenchanted} (to become disillusioned [nibbindituṃ]), \{to become detached} (to become dispassionate [virajjituṁ]) and \{to become free from} (to be liberated from [vimuccituṃ]) \{all conditions} (all formations, all activities, all fabrications [sabbasaṅkhāra])."
