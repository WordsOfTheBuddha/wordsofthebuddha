Thus the Venerable Tissa Metteyya said:
"For one engaged in sexual activity,
speak of the obstacles, dear sir;
Having heard your teaching,
we shall practice in solitude."

The Blessed One addressed Metteyya:
"One engaged in sexual pursuits,
tends to forget or disregard the teachings;
And practices the wrong path,
this is considered ignoble in him.

Whoever, once solitary in conduct,
now engages in sexual activity;
He resembles a broken vehicle,
and is deemed lowly by ordinary people.

His fame and renown, which were once prominent,
now decline or completely fade;
Seeing this as well, you should practice
to abandon sexual activity.

Enclosed by (lustful) intentions,
he broods like a miser;
Upon hearing the criticism of others,
such a one becomes disturbed.

Provoked by others' reproach,
he responds with harsh words;
Indeed, he comes into a great conflict,
by engaging in wrong speech.

Regarded as wise,
and dedicated to solitary conduct;
But then engaging in sexual activity,
he will become weary as if enfeebled.

Understanding this danger,
the sage, reflecting on both past and future;
should firmly establish solitary conduct,
and refrain from engaging in sexual activity.

One should train only in seclusion,
this is the supreme path for the noble ones;
One who would not consider oneself 'best' because of this,
he is indeed near to NibbƒÅna.

As the sage dwells, empty of desires,
unconcerned with sensual pleasures;
Having crossed the flood, they're envied,
by those bound to sensual pleasures.
