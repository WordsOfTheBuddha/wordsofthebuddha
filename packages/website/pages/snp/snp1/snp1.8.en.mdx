This should be done by one who is skilled in goodness,
And understands the path to peace:
Let them be able, upright and approachable,
Gentle in speech, humble in deeds, and free of conceit.

Content and easily satisfied,
Unburdened with duties, living simply;
Calm in senses and wise,
Unassuming, not greedy for support.

Let them not engage in the slightest wrongdoing
that the wise would later criticize;
Wishing: In gladness and in safety,
May all beings be at ease.

Whatever living beings there may be,
Whether rooted like trees or roaming free;
From lengthy to vast,
From medium to the miniscule, encompassing all sizes.

Those seen and those unseen,
Those dwelling far and those near,
Those already born and those yet to be,
May all beings be at ease.

One should not deceive another
Nor despise anyone anywhere.
Even when faced with hostility or perceived aggression,
Let one not wish suffering upon another.

Just as a mother would protect
her only child at the risk of her own life,
So too, towards all beings,
One should cultivate an immeasurable mind.

With loving-kindness towards the entire world,
Cultivate a boundless and immeasurable mind;
Upwards, downwards, and across without obstruction,
Free from hostility and enmity.

Whether standing, walking, sitting,
or lying down, free from drowsiness;
One should sustain this recollection,
This is said to be the sublime abiding.

Without holding on to fixed views,
Endowed with virtue and clear vision,
Having subdued the yearning for sense pleasures,
One does not come to be in a womb again.
