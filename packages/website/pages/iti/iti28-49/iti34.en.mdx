This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, Thus have I heard:

"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is \{lacking continuous effort} (without energy, without application [anātāpī]) and is \{without concern} (without regret, without remorse, without a sense of shame [anottāpī]) is incapable of \{full awakening} (perfect understanding, enlightenment [sambodha]), incapable of Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]), incapable of attaining the unsurpassed safety from bondage. But, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is \{endowed with continuous effort} (ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]) and \{endowed with a sense of shame} (with regret, with remorse, with concern [ottāpī]) is capable of full awakening, capable of Nibbāna, capable of attaining the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Lacking continuous effort and without concern,
a lazy (procrastinating, inactive person, indolent [kusīta]) person who is \{weak in effort} (low in energy, lacking in endurance, lacking determination [hīnavīriya]);
Overcome by dullness and drowsiness,
without shame, and without respect;
Such a bhikkhu is incapable,
of reaching the highest awakening.

But one who is mindful, discerning and meditates,
with continuous effort, with concern, and diligent (doing one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamatta]);
Having cut off the fetter (chain, bond, thing which binds [saṁyojana]) of \{birth and old age} (being born and ageing [jātijarā]),
such a one, in the here and now, reaches the highest awakening."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, Thus have I heard.
