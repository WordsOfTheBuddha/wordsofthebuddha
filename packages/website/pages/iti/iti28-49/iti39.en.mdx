This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, thus I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, for the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Fully Awakened One, there are two principles of explaining the Dhamma. What are the two? 1) 'See harm (evil, wrong, worthless, bad [pāpaka]) as harm' — this is the first principle; and 2) 'Having seen harm as harm, become \{disenchanted with} (disillusioned with [nibbindati]) it, become \{detached from} (dispassionate towards [virajjati]) it, and be \{released from} (freed from [vimuccati]) it' — this is the second principle."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Of the Tathāgata, the Buddha,
who is compassionate towards all beings;
See the two principles,
of explaining the Dhamma.

See this harm [for what it is],
and become disenchanted with it;
With a mind free from attachment,
you will bring an end to suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard.
