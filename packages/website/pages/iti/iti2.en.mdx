Thus it was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, abandon one thing; I am your guarantor for non-returning. What one thing? Bhikkhus, abandon aversion; I am your guarantor for non-returning."

The Blessed One spoke this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"When overcome by aversion,
beings go to a bad destination;
Completely comprehending aversion,
those with insight abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not come again,
to this world at any time."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard.
