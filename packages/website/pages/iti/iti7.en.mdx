This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, without directly knowing, not completely understanding the all, with the mind \{not detaching} (not losing interest, not losing desire for, remaining passionate [avirājayanta]) from it and \{without abandoning} (not giving up, not letting go of [appajahaṁ]) it, one is incapable of ending suffering. Indeed bhikkhus, by directly knowing, by fully understanding the all, with the mind detaching from it, and by abandoning it, one is capable of ending suffering."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"One who, having fully known everything in all respects,
does not \{find pleasure in} (is enamored with, is infatuated with, is attached to [rajjati]) anything anywhere;
Such a one, has completely understood the all,
and has transcended all suffering."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard.
