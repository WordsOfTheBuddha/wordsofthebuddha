This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, abandon one thing; I am your guarantor for non-returning. What one thing? Bhikkhus, abandon delusion (illusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view [moha]); I am your guarantor for non-returning."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Disoriented by delusion, through which,
beings go to an unfortunate destination;
Completely comprehending that delusion,
those seeing clearly abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not come again,
to this world at any time."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, Thus have I heard.
