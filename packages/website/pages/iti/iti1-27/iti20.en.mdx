This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, thus I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, having examined a certain person with a corrupted (corrupted, such as often angry, upset, or resentful [paduṭṭha]) mind, I know through my mind that if this person were to die at this moment, they would be reborn in hell (a place of intense suffering [niraya]), just as if they were carried and placed (dropped, set aside [nikkhitta]) there. Why is that? Because their mind is corrupted. Due to the corruption of the mind, bhikkhus, some beings, after the breakup of the body, after death, are \{reborn in a state of loss} (in a state of misery [apāya]), in the \{lower realms} (in realms of misery [vinipāta]), in hell."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Having known a certain person here,
to have a corrupted mind;
The Buddha explained this matter,
in the presence of the bhikkhus —

If this person were to die,
at this very moment;
They would be reborn in hell,
for their mind is corrupted.

Just as one might seize something and \{throw it down} (discard, drop [nikkhipati]),
so too is such a person [treated in the same way];
Indeed, due to the corruption of the mind,
beings go to a bad destination."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard.
