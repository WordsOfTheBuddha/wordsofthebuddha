Thus was it said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, for a trainee bhikkhu whose mind has not yet attained the unsurpassed security from bondage, who is dwelling and aspiring for it, I do not see any other single factor as so helpful as \{wise attention} (proper attention, prudent use of the mind, wise reflection, attention to the source [yonisomanasikāra]). Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attending wisely abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore it is said thus:

"Wise attention,
is the quality of a trainee bhikkhu;
No other factor is as helpful,
for attaining the highest goal;
The bhikkhu who strives thoroughly,
reaches the end of suffering."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard.
