This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, thus I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, one thing arises in the world \{for the harm of many people} (that causes disadvantage, injury, and distress to a large group of people [bahujanāhitāya]) and \{for the discomfort of many people} (leads to unhappiness, trouble, and affliction for many people [bahujanāsukhāya]). It arises \{for the misfortune} (to the detriment [anatthāya]) and disadvantage (damage [ahitāya]) and suffering (pain, discomfort, unease, unpleasantness, trouble, stress [dukkha]) of both gods and humans. What is this one thing? It is the \{splitting apart of the community} (schism in the Saṅgha, division within the monastic community [saṅghabhedo]). When the community is divided, there are mutual quarrels, abusing (insulting, badmouthing [paribhāsā]), exclusion, and rejection (abandonment [pariccajana]) of one another. In such a situation, those \{without confidence} (who are non-believers [appasannā]) do not develop confidence, and some of those who have confidence change their minds."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"One who causes the splitting apart of the community is \{destined for a miserable state} (to be reborn in suffering [āpāyika]),
destined for hell (a place of intense suffering [niraya]), and will \{remain there for an aeon} (lasting a world cycle, a vast cosmic timespan [kappaṭṭha]);
Taking pleasure in division, and not living in accordance with the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]),
that one falls away from security and peace;
Having ruptured the unified (harmonious [samagga]) community,
that one suffers in hell for an aeon."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard.
