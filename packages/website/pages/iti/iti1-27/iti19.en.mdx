This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, thus I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, one thing arises in the world \{for the benefit of many people} (that brings well-being, advantage, and good outcomes for many [bahujanahitāya]) and \{for the happiness of many people} (leads to joy, ease, and comfort for many [bahujanasukhāya]). It arises \{for the sake of} (for the purpose of [atthāya]), for the \{benefit of} (good of, welfare of [hitāya]) and for the \{ease of} (comfort of, contentment of [sukhāya]) of both gods and humans. What is this one thing? It is the \{harmony in the monastic community, unity within the Saṅgha} (concord within the community [saṅghasāmaggī]). When the community is unified, bhikkhus, there are no mutual quarrels, no mutual abuse, no exclusion, and no abandonment of one another. In such a situation, those \{without confidence} (who are non-believers [appasannā]) gain confidence, and those who have confidence increase their confidence."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Harmony in the community brings ease,
and supporting the unified brings further joy;
One who enjoys unity and is firmly established in the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]),
does not fall away from peace and security;
Having established the community in harmony,
one rejoices in heaven for an aeon (lifespan of a world system [kappa])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard.
