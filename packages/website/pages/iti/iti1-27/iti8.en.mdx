This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, without directly knowing, without completely understanding conceit (pride, egotism, superiority, comparing oneself [māna]), with the mind \{not detaching} (not losing interest, not losing desire for, remaining passionate [avirājayanta]) from it, and \{without abandoning} (not giving up, not letting go of [appajahaṁ]) it, one is incapable of ending suffering. Indeed bhikkhus, by directly knowing, by fully understanding conceit, with the mind detaching from it, and by abandoning it, one is capable of ending suffering."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"This generation is accompanied by conceit,
bound by the knot of conceit, they delight in becoming;
Not fully understanding conceit,
they will come to renewed existence.

But those who have fully understood conceit,
freed through the eradication of comparing;
They have overcome the knot of conceit,
and have transcended all suffering."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, Thus have I heard.
