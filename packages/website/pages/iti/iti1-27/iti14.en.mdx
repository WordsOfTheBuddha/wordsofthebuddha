This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single barrier by which beings, enveloped by it, run through and undergo repeated existence for a long time, like this barrier of ignorance. Indeed, bhikkhus, it is because beings are enveloped by the barrier of ignorance that they run through and undergo repeated existence for a long time."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"There is no other single thing,
by which beings when enveloped;
It makes them transmigrate day and night,
as when enveloped by delusion (illusion, hallucination, misperception, distorted view [moha]).

But those who have put an end to delusion,
and have shattered the mountain of ignorance;
They do not transmigrate again,
for the cause no longer exists for them."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, Thus have I heard.
