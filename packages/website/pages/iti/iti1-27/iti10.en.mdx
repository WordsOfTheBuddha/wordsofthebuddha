This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, without directly knowing, without completely comprehending aversion (ill-will, hate, hatred, fault, resentment [dosa]), with the mind \{not detaching} (not losing interest, not losing desire for, remaining passionate [avirājayanta]) from it, and \{without abandoning} (not giving up, not letting go of [appajahaṁ]) it, one is incapable of ending suffering. Indeed bhikkhus, by directly knowing, by fully comprehending aversion, with the mind detaching from it, and by abandoning it, one is capable of ending suffering."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Overcome by aversion, through which,
beings go to an unfortunate destination;
Completely comprehending that aversion,
those seeing clearly abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not return,
to this world at any time."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, Thus have I heard.
