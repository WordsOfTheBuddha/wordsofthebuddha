This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single fetter by which beings are bound that causes them to wander and transmigrate (wandering on, moving on continuously [saṁsaraṁ]) for a long time as does this fetter of craving (wanting, desire, attachment [tanhā]). Indeed bhikkhus, fettered by craving, beings wander and transmigrate for a long time."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"A person with craving as their companion,
transmigrates for a long time;
From one state of existence to another,
they do not transcend the cycle of existence.

Recognizing this danger,
that craving is the cause of suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa]);
Free from craving and \{without clinging} (free from attachment, not grasping, not taking anything as one's own [anādāno]),
the bhikkhu should wander mindfully."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard.
