Thus it was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single barrier by which beings, enveloped by it, run through and undergo repeated existence for a long time, like this barrier of ignorance. Indeed, bhikkhus, it is because beings are enveloped by the barrier of ignorance that they run through and undergo repeated existence for a long time."

The Blessed One spoke this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"There is no other single thing,
by which beings are enveloped;
That makes them transmigrate day and night,
as when enveloped by delusion (illusions, misperceptions, distorted views).

But those who have put an end to delusion (through investigation, close examination, and verification),
and have shattered the mountain of ignorance;
They do not transmigrate again,
for the cause no longer exists for them."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard.
