This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these three quests (searches, pursuits [esanā]). What three? The quest for sensual pleasure, the quest for renewed existence, and the quest for spiritual life. These are the three quests."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Collected (composed, settled [samāhita]) and \{fully aware} (clearly comprehending [sampajāna]),
the mindful (remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]) disciple of the Buddha;
Understands quests,
and the source of quests.

Where these [quests] cease (finish, vanish, reach an end [nirujjhati]),
and the way of practice \{leading to their cessation} (leading to their wearing away [khayagāmī]);
With the cessation of quests, the bhikkhu,
is satiated (satisfied, desireless [nicchāta]) and \{completely quenched [of mental defilements]} (completely cooled mental defilements [parinibbuta])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
