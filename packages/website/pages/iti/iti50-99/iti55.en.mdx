This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these three quests (searches, pursuits [esanā]). What three? The quest for sensual pleasure, the quest for renewed existence, and the quest for spiritual life. These are the three quests."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"The quest for sensual pleasure, the quest for renewed existence,
along with the quest for spiritual life; 
Result from \{holding tight to the thought, 'This is the truth'} (clutching something as the truth [saccaparāmāsa]),
and the accumulation of \{bases for views} (grounds for views, opinions, beliefs [diṭṭhiṭṭhānā]).

For one \{detached from all passion} (with desire faded away [sabbarāgaviratta]),
\{who is liberated through the exhaustion of craving} (who is released through the depletion of desire [taṇhakkhayavimutti]);
Quests are renounced (given up, relinquished [paṭinissaṭṭha]),
and bases for views are uprooted (eradicated [samūhata]);
With the cessation of quests, the bhikkhu,
is fulfilled (free from hope, desire-less [nirāsa]) and \{without doubt} (without confusion [akathaṅkathī])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
