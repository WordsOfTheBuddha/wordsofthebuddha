This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, thus I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, I have seen beings endowed with good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct, who do not slander the Noble Ones, who \{hold right views} (who has right outlook, who has correct understanding of how things have come to be [sammādiṭṭhikā]), and who \{undertake actions based on right views} (perform deeds based on correct outlook [sammādiṭṭhikammasamādānā]). After the breaking up of the body, after death, they are reborn in \{a fortunate state} (a good destination [sugati]), in a heavenly world.

But, bhikkhus, I do not say this having heard it from another ascetic or brahmin. Bhikkhus, I have seen beings endowed with good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct, who do not slander the Noble Ones, who hold right views, and who undertake actions based on right views. After the breaking up of the body, after death, they are reborn in a fortunate state, in a heavenly world. Moreover, bhikkhus, what I have known for myself, seen for myself, and realized for myself, that is what I declare.

Bhikkhus, I have seen beings endowed with good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct, who do not slander the Noble Ones, who hold right views, and who undertake actions based on right views. After the breaking up of the body, after death, they are reborn in a fortunate state, in a heavenly world."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"With a mind set on right intentions,
and having spoken right speech;
Having undertaken right actions with the body,
a person here -

Learned and a doer of merit,
though this life is short;
After the body's break-up,
that \{discerning one} (one who has cultivated wisdom [sappañña]) is reborn in a heavenly world."
