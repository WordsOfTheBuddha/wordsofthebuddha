This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these three bases for meritorious action. What are the three? The base for meritorious action \{through generosity} (produced by giving, charity [dānamaya]), the base for meritorious action \{through virtuous conduct} (defined by ethical behavior [sīlamaya]), and the base for meritorious action \{through meditation} (developed by meditation [bhāvanāmaya]). These, bhikkhus, are the three bases for meritorious action."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"One should train only in merit,
which brings long-lasting happiness;
Cultivate generosity, virtuous conduct,
and develop \{a mind of loving-kindness} (a mind of benevolence, a friendly heart [mettacitta]).

Having developed these qualities,
the three causes of happiness;
The wise one re-arises,
in a non-afflictive and pleasant world."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
