This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, thus I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these three types of eyesight (faculty of seeing, vision [cakkhu]). What three? The \{physical eye} (fleshly eye [maṃsacakkhu]), the \{divine eye} (clairvoyance, supernormal vision [dibbacakkhu]), and the \{eye of wisdom} (insight [paññācakkhu]). These, bhikkhus, are the three types of eyesight."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"The physical eye, the divine eye,
the unsurpassed eye of wisdom;
These three types of eyesight,
were declared by the best of men.

The arising of the physical eye,
the way of practice to the divine eye;
When insight arises [in the mind],
the eye of wisdom is unsurpassed;
Whoever gains that eye,
is freed from all suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkhassa])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard.
