This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, thus I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are these three \{unwholesome thoughts} (unskillful thoughts, unbeneficial thinking, karmically unprofitable thoughts [akusalavitakka]). Which three? 1) A thought \{concerning one's reputation} (about one's social standing [anavaññattipaṭisaṃyutta]), 2) a thought \{concerning with gain, honor, and fame} (about possessions renown and popularity [lābhasakkārasilokapaṭisaṃyutta]), and 3) a thought associated \{with [inappropriate] concern for others} (with excessive compassion for others [parānuddayatāpaṭisaṃyutta]). These, indeed, are three unwholesome thoughts."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

Concerned with one's reputation,
\{valuing gain and honor} (respecting profit and accolades [lābhasakkāragārava]);
Rejoicing together with associates (colleagues, friends, co-workers [amacca]),
Such a one is far away from the \{exhaustion of the fetters} (wearing away of the bonds that bind one to the cycle of existence [saṃyojanakkhaya]).

Having left behind \{children and cattle} (sons and livestock [puttapasu]),
marriage and acquisitions (possessions [saṃhara]);
Such a bhikkhu is capable of,
attaining the \{highest awakening} (supreme enlightenment [sambodhimuttama]).

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus I have heard.
