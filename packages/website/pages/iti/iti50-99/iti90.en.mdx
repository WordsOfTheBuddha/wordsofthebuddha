    <br/>

    | **Four Pairs - Stages**            | **Eight kinds - Path**       | **Eight kinds - Fruition**    | **Fetters Overcome / Weakened**                                  |
    |----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, and Thus have I heard:

"Bhikkhus, there are three kinds of best confidence. What three? However many \{sentient beings} (living beings [satta]) there are - whether they are without feet, with two feet, with four feet, or with many feet; with form or formless; having perception, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient — the Tathāgata (one who has arrived at the truth, an epithet of the Buddha [tathāgata]), the Arahant (the worthy one, an epithet of a fully awakening being [arahant]), the \{Perfectly Awakened One} (fully awakened being, fully enlightened being [sammāsambuddha]) is regarded the foremost among them. Those bhikkhus, who place their confidence in the Buddha, place their confidence in the best. And for those who place their confidence in the best, the result is the best.

Bhikkhus, however many \{mental qualities} (mental phenomena [dhammā]) there are - whether conditioned (constructed, created, fabricated [saṅkhata]) or unconditioned (not created, unconstructed, unformed, epithet of Nibbāna [asaṅkhata]) - the \{fading of desire} (disappearance of desire, dispassion, disenchantment, detachment [virāga]) is regarded as the foremost among them. That is, the \{crushing of conceit} (removing vanity, subduing pride [madanimmadana]), the \{dispelling of thirst} (removal of thirst [pipāsavinaya]), the \{uprooting of clinging} (eradication of attachment [ālayasamugghāta]), the \{breaking off the cycle of existence} (ending continued existence [vaṭṭupaccheda]), the \{wearing away of craving} (depletion of desire, extinction of longing [taṇhakkhaya]), the fading of desire, cessation (ending, termination [nirodha]), Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]). Those, bhikkhus, who place their confidence in the teaching of fading of desire, place their confidence in the best. And for those who place their confidence in the best, the result is the best.

Bhikkhus, however many communities (fellowships, collections [saṅghā]) or gatherings (associations, groups [gaṇā]) there are, the \{community of the Tathāgata's disciples} (the Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples [tathāgatasāvakasaṅgha]) is regarded as the foremost among them. That is, the four pairs of persons, the eight kinds of individuals [1] — this is the Blessed One's community of disciples, worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation, and the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. Those, bhikkhus, who place their confidence in the community of the Blessed One's disciples, place their confidence in the best. And for those who place their confidence in the best, the result is the best."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Those who have placed their confidence in the foremost,
and who understand the unsurpassed Dhamma;
place their confidence in the best — the Buddha,
the unsurpassed one, worthy of offerings.

Those who place their confidence in the foremost mental quality,
the fading of desire, peace (calming, tranquility [upasama]), and contentment (ease, happiness, pleasant abiding [sukha]);
Those who place their confidence in the foremost community,
the unsurpassed field of merit.

For those who give gifts to the best,
their merit grows to be the best;
Their lifespan, beauty, fame (glory, prestige [yasa]),
reputation (renown, celebrity [kitti]), contentment, and strength grow to be the best.

The wise giver to the foremost,
one established in the highest mental quality;
Whether reborn as a god or as a human,
delights (is very happy, is jubiliant [pamodati]) having attained the best."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, Thus have I heard.
