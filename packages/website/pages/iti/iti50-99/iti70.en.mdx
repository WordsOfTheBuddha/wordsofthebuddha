This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who are endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct, who slander the Noble Ones, who \{hold wrong views} (who have false beliefs, misperceptions, incorrect understanding of how things have come to be [micchādiṭṭhikā]), and who \{undertake actions based on wrong views} (perform deeds due to wrong beliefs [micchādiṭṭhikammasamādānā]). After the breaking up of the body, after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a state of suffering, in \{a state of misfortune} (a state of deprivation, an unhappy destination, perdition, hell [niraya]).

But, bhikkhus, I do not say this having heard it from another ascetic or brahmin. Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who are endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct, who slander the Noble Ones, who hold wrong views, and who undertake actions based on wrong views. After the breaking up of the body, after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a state of suffering, in a state of misfortune. Moreover, bhikkhus, what I have known for myself, seen for myself, and realized for myself, that is what I declare.

Bhikkhus, I have seen beings who are endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct, who slander the Noble Ones, who hold wrong views, and who undertake actions based on wrong views. After the breaking up of the body, after death, they are reborn in a state of loss, in a bad destination, in a state of suffering, in a state of misfortune."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"With a mind set on wrong intentions,
and having spoken wrong speech;
Having undertaken wrong actions with the body,
a person here -

Unlearned and without having made merit,
with a little life left here;
After the body's break-up,
that \{undiscerning one} (immature person, one lacking in discernment, one who has not cultivated wisdom [duppañña]) is reborn in a state of misfortune."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
