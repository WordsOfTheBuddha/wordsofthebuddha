This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"There are these three sensations (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience, feeling; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]), bhikkhus. What three? Pleasant sensation, painful sensation, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant sensation. These, bhikkhus, are the three sensations."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"Collected (composed, settled [samāhita]), \{fully aware} (with attentiveness, with clear and full comprehension, intentional, purposeful [sampajāna]),
a mindful (remembering to be present with continuous effort, observing the body in and of itself, feelings in and of itself, mind in and of itself, mental qualities in and of itself [sata]) disciple of the Buddha;
Discerns (distinguishes, understands, knows clearly [pajānāti]) sensations,
and the arising (origin, source [sambhava]) of sensations.

Where these cease (vanish, reach an end [nirujjhati]),
and the way of practice \{leading to their cessation} (leading to exhaustion, leading to wearing away [khayagāmī]);
With the cessation of sensations, the bhikkhu,
is \{satiated} (free from craving, desireless [nicchāta]) and \{completely quenched [of mental defilements]} (completely cooled mental defilements [parinibbuto])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
