This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

"There are these three sensations (pleasant, neutral or painful felt experience, feeling; second of the five aggregates [vedanā]), bhikkhus. What three? Pleasant sensation, painful sensation, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant sensation. Bhikkhus, a pleasant sensation should be seen as suffering (discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkha]); a painful sensation should be seen as a thorn (any sharp pointed object, mental dart, piercing pain [salla]); a sensation that is neither-painful-nor-pleasant should be seen as impermanent (unstable, transient, unreliable [anicca]). When a bhikkhu sees a pleasant sensation as \{[ultimately] dissatisfying} (a source of suffering [dukkha]), a painful sensation as a thorn, and a sensation that is neither-painful-nor-pleasant as impermanent, he is called noble, one with perfect understanding, who has completely cut off craving (wanting, yearning, longing, attachment, lit. thirst [taṇha]), unravelled (untied [vivattayi]) the fetters (chains, bonds, links, things which bind [saṃyojana]), and \{through full understanding of conceit} (through complete comprehension of pride, egotism, superiority, comparing oneself [mānābhisamaya]), has made an end of suffering."

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. In this regard, it is said:

"One who sees pleasure as ultimately dissatisfying,
who sees pain as a thorn;
And who sees the peaceful, neither-painful-nor-pleasant sensation,
as impermanent—

That bhikkhu, through perfect understanding,
is liberated at that very point;
Fully accomplished in \{direct knowing} (experiential realization [abhiññā]), tranquil (peaceful, calm [santa]),
is a sage (seer, hermit, monk [munī]) \{who has gone beyond the yoke} (who has transcended bondage [yogātiga])."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, as I have heard.
