Thus it was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, as I have heard:

Bhikkhus, without directly knowing, without fully understanding greed (lust, wanting, desire [lobha]), with the mind \{not detaching} (not losing interest, not losing desire for, remaining passionate [avirājayanta]) from it, and \{without abandoning} (not giving up, not letting go of [appajahaṁ]) it, one is incapable of ending suffering.

The Blessed One spoke on this matter. Therefore, it is said thus:

"Consumed by the greed, through which,
beings go to an unfortunate destination;
Completely understanding that greed,
those seeing clearly abandon it;
Having abandoned it, they do not return,
to this world at any time."

This matter too was spoken by the Blessed One, thus have I heard.
