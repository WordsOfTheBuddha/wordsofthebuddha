title: Daṇḍa vagga - Chapter 10 - Punishment
description: Dhammapada verses 129-145 explore the themes of non-violence, the consequences of harmful actions, and the importance of self-discipline. Through metaphors of a broken gong, a well-trained horse, and skilled artisans, the verses emphasize that true purification comes not from external austerities but from inner restraint, mindfulness, and ethical conduct. The inevitability of death and the suffering caused by harming others are highlighted alongside the rewards of peace and wisdom for those who cultivate virtuous behavior.

### 129

All fear punishment (rod, stick [daṇḍa]),
all fear death;
Considering others like oneself,
one should neither kill (beat, strike, thrash, stab, execute [hanati]) nor cause to kill.

### 130

All fear punishment,
life is dear to all;
Considering others like oneself,
one should neither kill nor cause to kill.

### 131

Beings wishing for happiness (ease, contentment, comfort [sukha]),
who harm others with punishment;
While seeking happiness for themselves,
after death, they do not find happiness.

### 132

Beings wishing for happiness,
who do not harm others with punishment;
While seeking happiness for themselves,
after death, they find happiness.

### 133

Do not speak harshly (severely, sharply [pharusa]) to anyone,
for if spoken to, they might respond to you;
Indeed, \{angry words} (quarrelsome speech, argumentative talk [sārambhakathā]) bring suffering,
and retaliation may affect (harm, impact [phuseyyu]) you.

### 134

If you remain non-agitated (unperturbed, calm, composed [neresi]),
like a broken gong (a musical instrument, a bell [kaṃsa]);
You will have attained Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]),
and no trace of stubbornness (refusal to change or let go of ego, inflexibility caused by pride or attachment [sārambha]) will remain in you.

### 135

Just as the cowherd,
drives the cows to the pasture with a stick;
So too do old age and death,
drive the life-span of \{living beings} (sentient beings, breathing beings [pāṇī]).

### 136

While doing harmful (injurious, destructive, bad, evil [pāpaka]) deeds,
the \{immature person} (one not mature in faculties, a childish person [bāla]) does not understand (comprehend, realize, grasp [bujjhati]);
Through their own deeds, the \{undiscerning one} (one lacking discernment, who has not cultivated wisdom, unwise [dummedha]),
\{is tormented} (regrets, feels remorse [tappati]), as if \{burned by fire} (scorched by flames [aggidaḍḍha]).

### 137

Whoever, with punishment (use of force or violence leading to harm [daṇḍa]) harms those that are peaceful (who do not deserve punishment [adaṇḍa]),
or \{harms} (offends, injures, does wrong to [dussati]) those who are blameless (without fault [appaduṭṭha]);
Will very quickly experience,
one of these ten situations.

### 138

They may experience \{sharp pain} (severe pain [pharusa + vedanā]),
or the fracturing (injuring, breaking [bhedana]) of the body;
Or else \{grave illness} (serious affliction, heavy suffering [garuka + ābādha]),
or they may fall into \{mental confusion} (insanity, madness [cittakkhepa]).

### 139

Or they may face trouble from the authorities (king, ruler, government [rājato]),
or a harsh accusation (slander, false charge [abbhakkhāna]);
Or the loss (demise, depletion [parikkhaya]) of their relatives (family, kinsmen [ñātī]),
or the \{perishing of} (collapse of, breaking of [pabhaṅgura]) their possessions (wealth, property, riches [bhoga]).

### 140

Or else, their houses (homes, dwellings, abodes [agāra]),
may be burned down by fire;
Or on the disintegration (breaking, splitting apart [bheda]) of the body [through death],
the \{one who has not cultivated wisdom} (immature person, one lacking discernment [duppañña]) goes to hell (a state of deprivation, an unhappy destination, perdition [niraya]).

### 141

Neither going naked, nor matted hair, nor covering oneself with mud,
nor fasting (not eating [nānāsakā]), nor sleeping on bare ground;
nor dust and dirt, nor squatting ascetic practices,
purify a mortal \{who has not overcome doubt} (who has not crossed beyond uncertainty [avitiṇṇakaṅkha]).

### 142

Even if adorned, if one walks \{with tranquility} (with balance, with serenity [sama]),
At peace, tamed, restrained, and \{practicing the spiritual life} (living the holy life, abstaining from sexual intercourse [brahmacāri]);
Having laid down violence (actions that cause injury [daṇḍa]) towards all beings,
that person is a brahmin, an ascetic, a bhikkhu.

### 143

A person restrained by a \{sense of right and wrong} (sense of shame, conscience, modesty [hirī]),
if such a one is found in the world;
Who shies away from sleeping too much,
is like a fortunate horse under the whip.

### 144

Just as a noble horse is disciplined by the whip,
be \{with continuous effort} (ardent, zealous, with energy, with application [ātāpī]) and \{feeling a sense of urgency} (anxiety [saṁvega]);
By faith, virtue and effort,
with collectedness (with a stable mind, with mental composure, with concentration [samādhinā]) and \{discernment of mental qualities} (investigation of reality [dhammavinicchaya]);
Fully endowed with wisdom and ethical conduct and self-aware (mindful [patissata]),
and you will abandon this considerable suffering.

### 145

Irrigators guide water,
fletchers (arrow makers [usukāra]) shape the shaft [of an arrow];
Carpenters shape wood,
\{one of good conduct} (virtuous person [subbata]) tames (masters, controls [damayati]) themselves.
