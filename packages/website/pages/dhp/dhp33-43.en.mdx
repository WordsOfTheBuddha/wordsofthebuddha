#### 33

Unstable and unsteady is the mind,
difficult to guard and restrain;
The wise one makes it straight,
like a fletcher straightens an arrow.

#### 34

Like a fish tossed on land,
when pulled out from its home in the water;
The mind trembles and shakes,
struggling to escape Māra's realm.

#### 35

Tricky to pin down and swift,
landing wherever it wants;
The taming of the mind is good,
for the tamed mind leads to ease.

#### 36

The mind is very subtle and hard to see,
landing wherever it wants;
The wise one should guard the mind,
for a guarded mind leads to ease.

#### 37

Wandering far and moving on its own,
immaterial, dwelling in a cave (hiding place);
Those who restrain the mind,
will be freed from Māra's bonds.

#### 38

For one whose mind is unsteady,
and who does not understand the true Dhamma;
For one whose confidence wavers,
wisdom does not reach fullness.

#### 39

For one whose mind is not agitated,
and whose thoughts are not afflicted;
For one who has abandoned merit and demerit,
there is no fear for the alert.

#### 40

Having understood this body as being [fragile] like a clay pot,
and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city;
One should fight out Māra with the sword of wisdom.
Then guarding the victory, one should remain without attachment.

#### 41

Before long, this body,
will lie upon the earth;
discarded and devoid of consciousness,
like a useless log.

#### 42

Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy,
or a hostile person may do to another;
a mind that is wrongly directed,
inflicts on oneself greater harm.

#### 43

Not even one's mother or father,
or any other relatives;
can do as much good,
as a mind that is rightly directed.
