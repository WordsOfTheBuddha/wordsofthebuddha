### 116

One should hasten to do good (what is beneficial, wholesome, skillful, meritorious [kalyāṇa]),
and restrain the mind from harm (evil, wrong, worthless, bad [pāpaka]);
For when one is slow in doing good,
the mind takes delight in harm.

### 117

If a person \{commits harm} (produces harm to oneself, harm to others, or harm to both),
they should not do it again and again;
One should not take delight in it,
for the accumulation of harm brings suffering (mild suffering, intense suffering, discomfort, pain, disease, unpleasantness, stress, discontentment, dissatisfaction [dukkha]).

### 118

If a person \{does good} (produces good for oneself, good for others, or good for both),
they should do it again and again;
One should take delight in it,
for the accumulation of good brings contentment (ease, comfort, happiness, pleasure [sukha]).

### 119

Even a person who causes harm may see good fortune,
as long as the harm has not ripened;
But when the harm ripens,
then the harm-doer experiences the consequences of harm.

### 120

Even a doer of good may experience harm,
as long as the good has not ripened;
But when the good ripens,
then the doer of good experiences good results.

### 121

Do not underestimate harm,
thinking, 'It will not come back to me';
Just as a water jar is filled,
by falling drops of water;
So too, the \{undiscerning one} (childish person, immature person [bāla]) is filled with harm,
accumulating it little by little.

### 122

Do not underestimate good,
thinking, 'It will not come to me';
Just as a water jar is filled,
by falling drops of water;
So too, the \{wise one} (intelligent one, stable, steady [dhīra]) is filled with good,
accumulating it little by little.

### 123

Just as a merchant with few companions and great wealth,
avoids a dangerous road;
So too, should one wishing to live,
avoid harmful actions like avoiding poison.

### 124

If there is no wound on the hand,
one may carry poison with the hand;
Poison does not affect one without a wound,
and there is no consequence for one who does not do harm.

### 125

Whoever harms (injures, opposes, hates, detests [dussati]) a blameless (without fault, who is not angry, not upset [appaduṭṭha]) person,
a pure person without blemish;
the harm comes back to that undiscerning one,
like fine dust thrown against the wind.

### 126

Some are born in the womb,
those who do harm arise in hell;
The well-conducted go to heaven,
and those \{free from defilements} (without mental effluents, taintless [anāsavā]) attain final liberation.

### 127

Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the sea,
nor by entering a mountain cave;
No place exists in the world,
where staying, one might escape from the result of their \{evil deeds} (unwholesome actions, harmful actions, misconduct [pāpakammā]).

### 128

Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the sea,
nor by entering a mountain cave;
No place exists in the world,
where staying, one might escape from death.
