#### 44

Who will discern this earth,
as well as the world of the dead and the world of the gods;
Who will understand the well-taught Dhammapada,
like a skillful one picking flowers.

#### 45

The trainee will discern this earth,
as well as the world of the dead and the world of the gods;
The trainee will understand the well-taught Dhammapada,
like a skillful one picking flowers.

#### 46

Having understood this body as like foam,
and having realized its illusory nature;
Having cut off Māra's flowery snares,
one goes beyond the sight of the King of Death.

#### 47

While gathering flowers,
with an attached mind;
Like a great flood sweeps away a sleeping village,
so does death carry such a person away.

#### 48

While gathering flowers,
with an attached mind;
Still unsatisfied with sensual pleasures,
such a person comes under death's control.

#### 49

Just as a bee approaches a flower,
without harming its color or fragrance;
And leaves having taken the nectar,
so should a sage conduct oneself in the village.

#### 50

Not the faults of others,
nor what others have or have not done;
One should observe one's own actions,
deeds, both done and not done.

#### 51

Just as a beautiful flower,
full of color but lacking fragrance;
So too, well-spoken words,
bear no fruit for one who does not act.

#### 52

Just as a beautiful flower,
full of color and fragrance;
So too, well-spoken words,
bear fruit for one who acts.

#### 53

Just as from a heap of flowers,
one could make many garlands;
So too, by one who is born and mortal,
much good should be done.

#### 54

The fragrance of flowers does not go against the wind,
nor does the fragrance of sandalwood, tagara, or jasmine;
But the fragrance of the virtuous goes against the wind,
the noble person's virtue spreads in all directions.

#### 55

Sandalwood, tagara,
lotus, and also jasmine;
Of all these kinds of fragrances,
the fragrance of virtue is unsurpassed.

#### 56

Faint is this fragrance,
the scent of tagara and sandalwood;
But the fragrance of the virtuous
blows as unsurpassed among the gods.

#### 57

Of those with perfected virtue,
who dwell with diligence (quality of wishing to do one's work or duty well, with alertness, carefulness and care [appamāda]);
Fully liberated through true wisdom,
their path is not found by Māra.

#### 58

Just as in a heap of garbage,
discarded by the roadside,
A lotus would grow there,
with a pure fragrance, delightful and pleasing.

#### 59

So, among those defiled,
blind and ignorant, ordinary people;
One who shines through wisdom,
is a disciple of the fully awakened Buddha.
