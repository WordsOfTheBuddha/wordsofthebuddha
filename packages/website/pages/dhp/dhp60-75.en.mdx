#### 60

Long is the night for one who is staying awake,
long is a league (a unit of distance) for one who is tired;
Long is the transmigration (wandering on, moving on continuously, passing from one state of existence to another, stream of existence, cyclic existence [saṃsāra]) for the immature (lacking in good sense or judgement, young in years, child like [bāla]),
those who do not understand the true Dhamma.

#### 61

If, while wandering, one does not find,
a companion who is better or equal;
One should steadfastly pursue a solitary life,
there is no fellowship with the immature.

#### 62

"These are my children, this is my wealth,"
with such thoughts the immature person is afflicted (is troubled by, is worried about, is distressed by, suffers anguish from [vihaññati]);
One's self is not even one's own,
how then, can there be sons? How then, can there be wealth?

#### 63

The immature person who knows his immaturity,
is wise at least to that extent;
The immature person who thinks themselves to be wise,
is indeed said to be "immature".

#### 64

Even if an immature person, for a whole lifetime,
associates closely with a wise person;
They do not understand the Dhamma,
just as a spoon does not know the taste of soup.

#### 65

Even if a wise person, for just a moment,
associates closely with a wise person;
They swiftly understand the Dhamma,
just as the tongue knows the taste of soup.

#### 66

Immature persons who lack discernment act,
with themselves as their own enemy;
Performing harmful deeds,
which \{bear bitter fruit} (with painful results [kaṭuka + phala]).

#### 67

That action is not well done,
which, having been done, one later regrets;
With a tearful face, one weeps,
experiencing its result.

#### 68

And that action is well done,
which, having done, one does not regret;
One is pleased and satisfied,
experiencing its result.

#### 69

An immature person conceives (thinks, imagines, perceives, presumes, supposes [maññati]) it is like honey,
until the misdeed does not ripen;
but when the misdeed ripens,
then they fall into suffering (pain, discomfort, unease, unpleasantness, trouble, stress [dukkha]).

#### 70

Month after month, with the tip of a grass blade,
an immature person may eat their food;
they do not equal those who have \{comprehended the Dhamma} (understood the nature of reality, realized the truth, an Arahant [saṅkhāta + dhamma]),
not even by a sixteenth.

#### 71

Indeed, an evil deed, once performed,
does not solidify quickly, like fresh milk thickening;
Smoldering, it shadows the immature person,
like fire hidden beneath ashes.

#### 72

Only to the extent of harm,
does knowledge arise in an immature person;
It destroys his good fortune,
and tears his head apart.

#### 73

One might wish for undeserved reputation,
and honor among the bhikkhus;
Control over dwelling places,
and reverence among other families.

#### 74

Let them think, "This was done by me alone,"
both the laypeople and those gone forth;
Let them be dependent on me,
in all matters and tasks of any kind;
Such is the intention of an immature person,
and thus their longing (wish, desire [icchā]) and pride (conceit, egotism, superiority, comparing oneself [māna]) grows.

#### 75

For the pursuit of gain is one thing,
and the path to Nibbāna is another;
Having understood this,
a bhikkhu, a disciple of the Buddha,
Should not take delight in honor,
but should cultivate seclusion.
