#### 60

Long is the night for one who is staying awake,
long is a yojana (a unit of distance used in ancient India, ranging from 3.5 to 15 km [yojana]) for one who is tired;
Long is the transmigration (wandering on, moving on continuously, passing from one state of existence to another, stream of existence, cyclic existence [saṃsāra]) for the immature (lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]),
those who do not understand the true Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]).

#### 61

If, while wandering, one does not find,
a companion who is better or equal;
One should steadfastly pursue a \{solitary life} (going about or living alone [ekacariyā]),
there is no fellowship with the immature (lacking in discernment or good sense, child-like in understanding [bāla]).

#### 62

"These are my children, this is my wealth,"
with such thoughts the immature person \{is afflicted} (is troubled by, is worried about, is distressed by, suffers anguish from [vihaññati]);
One's self is not even one's own,
how then, can there be sons? How then, can there be wealth?

#### 63

The immature person who knows his immaturity (childishness, ignorance [bālya]),
is wise to that extent;
The immature person who believes they are wise,
is truly said to be "immature."

#### 64

Even if for a whole lifetime, an immature person,
\{associates closely with} (honors, respects [payirupāsati]) a wise person;
They do not understand the Dhamma,
just as a spoon does not know the taste of soup.

#### 65

Even if for only a moment, a \{discerning person} (intelligent, who can distinguish [viññū]),
associates closely with a wise person;
They swiftly understand the Dhamma,
just as the tongue knows the taste of soup.

#### 66

Immature persons who lack discernment,
act as their own enemies;
Performing harmful deeds,
which \{bear bitter fruits} (with painful results [kaṭuka + phala]).

#### 67

That action is not well done,
which, having done, one \{later regrets} (suffers remorse from [anutappati]);
With a tearful face, one weeps,
experiencing its result.

#### 68

And that action is well done,
which, having done, one does not regret;
One is satisfied and cheerful,
experiencing its result.

#### 69

An immature person conceives (thinks, imagines, presumes, supposes [maññati]) it is like honey,
until the misdeed does not ripen;
but when the misdeed ripens,
then they fall into suffering (pain, discomfort, unease, unpleasantness, trouble, stress [dukkha]).

#### 70

Month after month, an immature person may eat their food,
\{with the tip of a grass blade} (a reference to undertaking an extreme austerity [kusagga]);
Yet compared to one who has \{comprehended the Dhamma} (understood the nature of reality, realized the truth, an Arahant [saṅkhātadhamma]),
they are not worth a sixteenth part.

#### 71

Indeed, an \{injurious action} (harmful, bad, potentially evil [pāpa]), once performed,
does not solidify quickly, like fresh milk thickening;
Smoldering, it shadows the immature person,
like fire hidden beneath ashes.

#### 72

Only for the sake of harm (misfortune, damage, injury, hurt, detriment [anattha]),
does knowledge arise in an immature person;
It afflicts their good fortune,
and shatters their head.

#### 73

One might wish for undeserved reputation,
and precedence (esteem [purekkhāra]) among the bhikkhus;
Authority over dwelling places,
and veneration (homage, honor [pūjā]) from other households.

#### 74

Let both householders and renunciants
think, "This was done by me alone,"
Let them be dependent on me,
in all matters whether important or trivial;
Such is the conception (thought, volition, purpose [saṅkappa]) of an immature person,
their longings (wishes, desires [icchā]) and pride (conceit, egotism, superiority, comparing oneself [māna]) only grow.

#### 75

For the pursuit of acquisitions (gain, money, profit, possessions [lābha]) is one thing,
and the path to Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]) is another;
Experientially understanding this,
a bhikkhu, a disciple of the Buddha;
Should not take delight in respect (honor, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]),
but should cultivate seclusion (solitude, detachment [viveka]).
