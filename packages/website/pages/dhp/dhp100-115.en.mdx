### 100

Rather than a thousand sayings,
\{if they are meaningless} (connected with meaningless words, not concerned with the goal [anatthapadasaṁhita]);
One saying is better,
which upon hearing \{brings peace} (is calmed, is cooled, is settled [upasammati]).

### 101

Rather than a hundred verses,
if they are meaningless;
One Dhamma verse is better,
which upon hearing brings peace.

### 102

Even if one recites a hundred verses,
if they are meaningless;
One Dhammapada verse is better,
which upon hearing brings peace.

### 103

Even if one were to conquer a thousand men,
with a thousand others in battle;
Yet if one conquers oneself alone,
that one is indeed the unsurpassed conqueror in battle.

### 104

Self-conquest is truly better,
than conquering others;
For one who has mastered oneself,
continuously dwells with restraint.

### 105

Neither a god, nor a celestial being,
nor Māra together with Brahmā;
Can undo the victory of one who is like that,
a person who has conquered themselves.
