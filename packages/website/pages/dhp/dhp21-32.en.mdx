#### 21

Heedfulness is the path to the deathless,
Heedlessness is the path to death;
The heedful do not die,
The heedless are as if dead.

#### 22

Thus, understanding this distinction,
The wise excel in heedfulness;
They rejoice in diligence,
Engaged in the domain of the noble ones.

#### 23

Those meditators who are persistent,
Always firm in effort;
The wise ones attain liberation,
The unsurpassed safety from the bonds.

#### 24

One who is diligent and mindful,
Of pure actions, who acts thoughtfully;
Self-restrained and living ethically,
The fame of such a heedful one surpasses.

#### 25

By initiative and diligence,
with self-restraint and discipline;
The wise one should make an island,
Which no flood can submerge.

#### 26

Immature, unwise people,
indulge in carelessness;
But the wise one guards heedfulness,
like supreme wealth.

#### 27

Do not indulge in carelessness,
Do not delight or associate with sensual pleasures;
The attentive one, meditating,
experiences abundant happiness.

#### 28

When with heedfulness,
the wise one dispels carelessness;
Climbing the tower of wisdom,
free from sorrow, seeing the sorrowful people;
Like one on a mountain top sees those on the ground,
the wise one sees the immature, unwise people.

#### 29

The heedful amongst the heedless,
wide awake amongst the asleep;
Like a swift horse amongst the feeble,
the wise one proceeds leaving them behind.

#### 30

Through heedfulness, Magha,
attained the higest state amongst the gods;
They praise heedfulness,
heedlessness is always condemned.

#### 31

A bhikkhu who is devoted to heedfulness,
who sees danger in heedlessness;
Burns away all fetters, both subtle and gross,
like a blazing fire that consumes everything.

#### 32

A bhikkhu who is devoted to heedfulness,
who sees danger in heedlessness;
Is incapable of decline,
And is near to Nibbāna.
