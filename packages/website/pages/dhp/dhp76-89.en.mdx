### 76

As one who reveals hidden treasures,
one should regard a person who sees faults;
A wise person who reproves and admonishes,
one should associate with such a wise person;
For one associating with such a person,
things become better, not worse.

### 77

One should advise and instruct [others],
and prevent what is unwholesome;
For one is dear to the virtuous,
but to the unvirtuous, one is not dear.

### 78

Do not associate with harmful (injurious, destructive, bad, evil [pāpaka]) friends,
do not associate with base (vile, mean [adhama]) people;
one should associate with good friends,
one should associate with best (highest, supreme [uttama]) amongst people.

### 79

One who is joyous in Dhamma dwells at ease,
with a clear and tranquil mind;
In the Dhamma taught by the noble ones,
the wise person always rejoices (enjoys, takes delight in [ramati]). 

### 80

Irrigators direct the water,
fletchers bend the arrow;
Carpenters shape the wood,
And the wise tame (master, control [damayanti]) themselves.

### 81

Just as a solid rock,
is not shaken by the wind;
So too in blame and praise,
the wise do not waver.

### 82

Just as a deep lake,
clear and undisturbed;
So too, having heard the teachings,
the wise \{become tranquil} (become serene, bright, radiant [vippasīdanti]).

### 83

Indeed, the virtuous (good, moral [sappurisā]) renounce [attachment for] everything,
the peaceful do not babble (chat up, appeal [lapayanti]), craving sensual pleasures;
When touched \{by pleasure} (by comfort, by ease [sukhena]) or \{by displeasure} (by discomfort, by pain [dukhena]),
the wise do not exhibit \{elation or dejection} (highs and lows, ups and downs [uccāvacaṃ]).

### 84

Not for one's own sake, nor for another's,
nor desiring son, wealth, or land;
One should not wish for prosperity through \{misconduct} (immoral behavior, unjust means, cheating [adhammena]),
one should be ethical, righteous and wise.

### 85

Few among humans are those,
who cross over to the further shore;
But the rest of the people,
merely run along the bank.

### 86

And those who follow the Dhamma,
well-taught and rightly expounded;
Those people will cross over,
the realm of death, which is so difficult to escape.

### 87

Abandoning the dark qualities,
the wise one should cultivate the bright;
Having gone from home to homelessness,
in solitude, which is hard to find.

### 88

One should desire happiness there,
having abandoned sensual pleasures, \{with nothing} (without possessions [akiñcano]);
the wise one should purify oneself,
from defilements (impurities [klesa]) of the mind.

### 89

For those whose mind has been well-developed,
in the \{factors of awakening} (the seven factors of awakening, factors of enlightenment [sambodhiyaṅga]);
Who, free from attachment,
are devoted to \{not holding onto} (not grasping onto, detaching from, not taking possession of [anupādāya]);
The ones whose taints are destroyed, who are radiant,
those are fully quenched in the world.
