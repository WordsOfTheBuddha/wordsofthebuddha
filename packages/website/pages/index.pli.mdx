### Studying With The Words of The Buddha

> More than two thousand five hundred years have passed since our kind teacher, Buddha Śākyamuni, taught in India. He offered advice to all who wished to heed it, inviting them to listen, reflect, and critically examine what he had to say. He addressed different individuals and groups of people over a period of more than forty years.

> After the Buddha's passing, a record of what he said was maintained as an oral tradition. Those who heard the teachings would periodically meet with others for communal recitations of what they had heard and memorized. In due course, these recitations from memory were written down, laying the basis for all subsequent Buddhist literature. The Pāli Canon is one of the earliest of these written records and the only complete early version that has survived intact. Within the Pāli Canon, the texts known as the Nikāyas have the special value of being a single cohesive collection of the Buddha's teachings in his own words. These teachings cover a wide range of topics; they deal not only with renunciation and liberation, but also with the proper relations between husbands and wives, the management of the household, and the way countries should be governed. They explain the path of spiritual development—from generosity and ethics, through mind training and the realization of wisdom, all the way up to the attainment of liberation.

— Venerable Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama's forward to In the Buddha's Words

> The Buddha’s discourses preserved in the Pāli Canon are called suttas, the Pāli equivalent of the Sanskrit word sūtras. Although the Pāli Canon belongs to a particular Buddhist school—the Theravāda, or School of the Elders—the suttas are by no means exclusively Theravāda Buddhist texts. They stem from the earliest period of Buddhist literary history, a period lasting roughly a hundred years after the Buddha’s death, before the original Buddhist community divided into different schools. The Pāli suttas have counterparts from other early Buddhist schools now extinct, texts sometimes strikingly similar to the Pāli version, differing mainly in settings and arrangements but not in points of doctrine. The suttas, along with their counterparts, thus constitute the most ancient records of the Buddha’s teachings available to us; they are the closest we can come to what the historical Buddha Gotama himself actually taught. The teachings found in them have served as the fountainhead, the primal source, for all the evolving streams of Buddhist doctrine and practice through the centuries. For this reason, they constitute the common heritage of the entire Buddhist tradition, and Buddhists of all schools who wish to understand the taproot of Buddhism should make a close and careful study of them a priority.

> "AT PRESENT, ALL THAT IS LEFT of Buddhism are the words of the Buddha."

— Venerable Ācariya Mahā Boowa in Arahattamagga ArahattaPhala

<br/>

> "Therefore, Ānanda, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge.

> Whoever, Ānanda, now or after my passing, dwells as an island unto themselves, with themselves as their own refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge; with the Dhamma as their island, with the Dhamma as their refuge, not dependent on another as a refuge; they, Ānanda, will be the foremost of those who are keen on the training."

— The Buddha's advise to Ānanda, [Cundasutta SN 47.13](/sn/sn45-56/sn47.13)

#### Roadmap

##### English Translation

- [x] Faithful reproduction from the source texts with a line-by-line fidelity between Pali and English texts. The Pali to English meanings are informed based on [Digital Pali Dictonary ↗️](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/changelog.html)
- [x] Preserve words in their original form that are representative of people, a state of practice, or a place: e.g. bhikkhu, jhāna, Nibbāna, Sāvatthi, etc.
- [x] Provide context in brackets for alternate close synonyms to certain terms that can benefit from a broader understanding, e.g. Greed (lust, desire, attachment), aversion (ill-will, hatred, resentment), and delusion (assumption making tendencies, absence of close examination and verification)
- [x] Translation aims to preserve causality sequence of how things come to be be, how they change and how they fade away, e.g. exhaustion of taints instead of destruction of taints.
- [x] Preserve repetitions in the original text to maintain the original structure and rhythm of the teachings.
