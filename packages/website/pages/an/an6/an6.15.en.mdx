There, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus:

### Delighting in Personal Existence

"Friends, a bhikkhu \{passes his time} (dwells [viharati]) in such a way that he dies with regret (experiences remorse [anutappa]). And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he dies with regret?

1 Here, friends, a bhikkhu \{delights in work} (takes pleasure in activity/work [kammārāma]), indulges in work, and is habitually devoted to work.

2 He delights in talk, indulges in talk, and is habitually devoted to talk.

3 He delights in sleep, indulges in sleep, and is habitually devoted to sleep.

4 He \{delights in company} (takes pleasure in association [saṅgaṇikārāma]), indulges in company, and is habitually devoted to company.

5 He \{delights in bonding} (takes pleasure in mingling and mixing [saṃsaggārāma]), indulges in bonding, and is habitually devoted to bonding.

6 He \{delights in mental proliferation} (enjoys manifold ideas, various opinions, takes pleasure in conceptualization [papañcārāma]), indulges in mental proliferation, and is habitually devoted to mental proliferation.

Friends, when a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way, he dies with regret and his passing away is not fortunate (auspicious, good [bhaddikā]). This is called a bhikkhu who delights in \{personal existence} (individual identity, embodied being, view that one is the owner of the body and mind [sakkāya]), who has not given up personal existence to completely make an end of suffering (discomfort, unpleasantness, discontentment, dissatisfaction, stress, pain, disease, i.e. mild or intense suffering [dukkha]).

### Giving up Personal Existence

Friends, a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way that he dies without regret. And how does a bhikkhu pass his time in such a way that he dies without regret?

1 Here, friends, a bhikkhu does not delight in work, does not indulge in work, and is not habitually devoted to work.

2 He does not delight in talk, does not indulge in talk, and is not habitually devoted to talk.

3 He does not delight in sleep, does not indulge in sleep, and is not habitually devoted to sleep.

4 He does not delight in company, does not indulge in company, and is not habitually devoted to company.

5 He does not delight in bonding, does not indulge in bonding, and is not habitually devoted to bonding.

6 He does not delight in mental proliferation, does not indulge in mental proliferation, and is not habitually devoted to mental proliferation.

Friends, when a bhikkhu passes his time in such a way, he dies without regret and his passing away is fortunate. This is called a bhikkhu who delights in Nibbāna (complete cooling, letting go of everything, deathless, freedom from calamity, the non-disintegrating [nibbāna]), who has given up personal existence to completely make an end of suffering.

### Verse

Whoever is engaged in mental proliferation,
who is delighted with mental proliferation;
Fails to attain Nibbāna,
the unsurpassed security from bondage.

But whoever, having abandoned mental proliferation,
delights in the state free from mental proliferation;
He attains Nibbāna,
the unsurpassed security from bondage.
