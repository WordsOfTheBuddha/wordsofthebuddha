"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single quality that causes unarisen sensual desire to arise, or arisen sensual desire to increase and expand, as a beautiful mental image. Bhikkhus, when one does not wisely attend to the sign of the beautiful, unarisen sensual desire arises, and arisen sensual desire increases and expands."

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single quality that causes unarisen ill-will to arise, or arisen ill-will to increase and expand, as an aversive mental image. Bhikkhus, when one does not wisely attend to the sign of resistance, unarisen ill-will arises, and arisen ill-will increases and expands."

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single quality that causes unarisen dullness and drowsiness to arise, or arisen dullness and drowsiness to increase and expand, as dissatisfaction, laziness, yawning, passing out after a meal, and sluggishness of mind. Bhikkhus, when the mind is sluggish, unarisen dullness and drowsiness arises, and arisen dullness and drowsiness increases and expands."

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single quality that causes unarisen restlessness and worry to arise, or arisen restlessness and worry to increase and expand, as an unsettled mind.

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single quality that prevents unarisen sensual desire from arising, or causes arisen sensual desire to be abandoned, as an unattractive mental image.

"Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single quality that prevents unarisen dullness and drowsiness from arising, or causes arisen dullness and drowsiness to be abandoned, as taking initiative, persistence, and continuous effort.
