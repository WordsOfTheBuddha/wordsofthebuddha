"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found in the world. What four? 1) One who values (gives weight to, gives importance to, emphasizes on, reifies [garu]) anger (rage, wrath, fury, indignation [kodha]), who does not value the \{good Dhamma} (good teaching, true doctrine, true nature of things, four foundations of mindfulness [saddhamma]); 2) one who values contempt (ungratefulness, depreciating, belittling, smirching, disparagement [makkha]), who does not value the good Dhamma; 3) one who values gain (acquisition, profit, advantage [lābha]), who does not value the good Dhamma; 4) one who values honor (respect, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]), who does not value the good Dhamma. These are the four kinds of persons found found in the world.

Bhikkhus, there are these four [other] kinds of persons found in the world. What four? 1) One who values the good Dhamma, who does not value anger; 2) one who values the good Dhamma, who does not value contempt; 3) one who values the good Dhamma, who does not value gain; 4) one who values the good Dhamma, who does not value honor. These are the four kinds of persons found in the world."

### Verse

Bhikkhus who value anger and contempt,
and who revere gain and honor;
Do not grow in the good Dhamma,
taught by the perfectly awakened one.

But those who value the good Dhamma,
and live in accordance with it;
They indeed grow in the good Dhamma,
taught by the perfectly awakened one.
