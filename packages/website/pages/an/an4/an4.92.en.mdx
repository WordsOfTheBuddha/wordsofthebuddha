"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, one person gains internal tranquility of mind but does not gain insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

Here, bhikkhus, another person gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom but does not gain internal tranquility of mind.

Here, bhikkhus, another person neither gains internal tranquility of mind nor gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

And then there is a person who gains both internal tranquility of mind and gains insight into phenomena through higher wisdom.

These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."
