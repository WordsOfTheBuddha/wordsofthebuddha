"Bhikkhus, there are these four unwholesome practices. What four? 1) Valuing anger (rage, wrath, fury, indignation [kodha]), not valuing the \{good Dhamma} (good teaching, true doctrine, true nature of things, four foundations of mindfulness [saddhamma = sat + dhamma]); 2) valuing contempt (ungratefulness, depreciating, belittling, smirching, disparagement [makkha]), not valuing the good Dhamma; 3) valuing gain (acquisition, profit, advantage [lābha]), not valuing the good Dhamma; 4) valuing honor (respect, accolade, reverence [sakkāra]), not valuing the good Dhamma. These are the four unwholesome practices.

Bhikkhus, there are these four wholesome practices. What four? 1) Valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing anger; 2) valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing contempt; 3) valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing gain; 4) valuing the good Dhamma, not valuing honor. These are the four wholesome practices."

### Verse

Bhikkhus who value anger and contempt,
and who revere gain and honor;
Do not grow in the good Dhamma,
taught by the perfectly awakened one.

But those who value the good Dhamma,
and live in accordance with it;
They indeed grow in the good Dhamma,
taught by the perfectly awakened one.
