Thus have I heard - One time, the Venerable Ānanda was staying in Kosambi, at Ghosita's park. There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus."

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied to the Venerable Ānanda.

The Venerable Ānanda said this: "Friends, whoever, whether a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī, declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence, they all do so by one of these four paths, or by one of them.

What are these four?

Here, friends, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by tranquility. As he develops insight preceded by tranquility, the path arises in him. He pursues that path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are eradicated.

Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops tranquility preceded by insight. As he develops tranquility preceded by insight, the path arises in him. He pursues that path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are eradicated.

Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops tranquility and insight in tandem. As he develops tranquility and insight in tandem, the path arises in him. He pursues that path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are eradicated.

Again, friends, a bhikkhu's mind is seized by agitation about the Dhamma. There comes a time when his mind becomes internally steadied, composed, unified, and collected. The path arises in him. He pursues that path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are eradicated.

Friends, whoever, whether a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī, declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence, they all do so by one of these four paths, or by one of them."
