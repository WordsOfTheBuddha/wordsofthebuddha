"Bhikkhus, these are the four things. What four? There are, bhikkhus, things that should be fully comprehended by direct knowing; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be abandoned by direct knowing; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be developed by direct knowing; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be personally realized by direct knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be fully comprehended by direct knowing? The five aggregates subject to clinging — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be fully comprehended by direct knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be abandoned by direct knowing? Ignorance (not understanding how things have come to be) and craving for becoming (existence) — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be abandoned by direct knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be developed by direct knowing? Tranquility and insight — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be developed by direct knowing.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be personally realized by direct knowing? Wisdom and liberation — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be realized by direct knowing.

These, indeed, bhikkhus, are the four things."
