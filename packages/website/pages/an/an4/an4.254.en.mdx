"Bhikkhus, these are the four things. What four? There are, bhikkhus, things that should be fully comprehended by direct knowledge; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be developed by direct knowledge; there are, bhikkhus, things that should be personally realized by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be fully comprehended by direct knowledge? The five aggregates subject to clinging — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be fully comprehended by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance (not understanding how things have come to be) and craving for becoming (existence) — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge? Tranquility and insight — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be developed by direct knowledge.

And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be personally realized by direct knowledge? Wisdom and liberation — these are called, bhikkhus, the things that should be realized by direct knowledge.

These, indeed, bhikkhus, are the four things."
