"Bhikkhus, there are these four types of persons found existing in the world. What four?

Here, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna with residual formations (intention, exertion, concotion) in this very life.
Here again, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna with residual formations after the breakup of the body.
Here again, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna without residual formations in this very life.
Here again, bhikkhus, a certain person attains final Nibbāna without residual formations after the breakup of the body.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna with residual formations in this very life? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the unpleasantness of food, recognizing disenchantment in the entire world, and observing impermanence in all formations. Moreover, the perception of death is well established within him. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of confidence (faith), the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of persistence (energy), and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop strongly in him: the faculty of confidence (faith), the faculty of persistence (energy), the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed strongly in him, he attains final Nibbāna with residual formations in this very life. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna with residual formations in this very life.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna with residual formations after the breakup of the body? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceives the unpleasantness of food, recognizing disenchantment with the entire world, and observing impermanence in all formations. Moreover, the perception of death is well established within him. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of confidence, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of persistence, and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop softly in him: the faculty of confidence, the faculty of persistence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed softly in him, he attains final Nibbāna with residual formations after the breakup of the body. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna with residual formations after the breakup of the body.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna without residual formations in this very life? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having secluded himself from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental states, with reflection and examination (of thoughts), born of seclusion, filled with joyful pleasure, enters and dwells in the first jhāna. With the subsiding of reflection and examination (of thoughts), experiencing internal tranquility and unification of mind, devoid of reflection and examination, born of collectedness and filled with joyful pleasure, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna. With the fading away of joyful pleasure, he dwells equanimous and mindful, fully aware, and experiences ease (bliss) with the body, which the noble ones describe as 'one who dwells happily, equanimous, and mindful.' Thus, he enters and dwells in the third jhāna. With the abandonment of ease (bliss) and suffering (discontentment, stress), and with the previous disappearance of joy and sorrow, experiencing neither painful nor pleasant sensation, and with the purity of equanimity and mindfulness, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of confidence, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of persistence, and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop strongly in him: the faculty of confidence, the faculty of persistence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed strongly in him, he attains final Nibbāna without residual formations in this very life. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna without residual formations in this very life.

And how, bhikkhus, does a person attain final Nibbāna without residual formations after the breakup of the body? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, having secluded himself from sensual pleasures and unwholesome mental states, with reflection and examination (of thoughts), born of seclusion, filled with joyful pleasure, attains and dwells in the first jhāna … second jhāna … third jhāna … Having abandoned both pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he attains a state neither painful nor pleasant, characterized by the purity of equanimity and mindfulness. In this state, he attains and dwells in the fourth jhāna. He lives relying on these five powers of a trainee: the power of confidence, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of persistence, and the power of wisdom. These five spiritual faculties develop softly in him: the faculty of confidence, the faculty of persistence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of collectedness, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties have developed softly in him, he attains final Nibbāna without residual formations after the breakup of the body. Thus, bhikkhus, a person attains final Nibbāna without residual formations after the breakup of the body.

These, bhikkhus, are the four types of persons found existing in the world."
