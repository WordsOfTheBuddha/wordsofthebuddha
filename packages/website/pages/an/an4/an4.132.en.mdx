"Bhikkhus, there are these four types of people found in the world. What are the four?

1. One \{with rational eloquence} (able to logically reason, have well-formed and structured thoughts [yuttappaṭibhāna]) but without spontaneous eloquence;

2. one \{with spontaneous eloquence} (with creative and/or free expression [muttappaṭibhāna]) but without rational eloquence;

3. one with both rational and spontaneous eloquence;

4. one with neither rational nor spontaneous eloquence.

These, bhikkhus, are the four types of people found in the world."
