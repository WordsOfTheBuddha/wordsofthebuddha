"Bhikkhus, there are these four things that are inconceivable, not to be speculated over or thought about; thinking about which would lead to confusion and distress. What four?

The domain of wisdom of the Buddhas, bhikkhus, is inconceivable, not to be speculated over or thought about; thinking about which would lead to confusion and distress.

The domain of wisdom of one in jhānas, bhikkhus, is inconceivable, not to be speculated over or thought about; thinking about which would lead to confusion and distress.

The result of kamma (deeds), bhikkhus, is inconceivable, not to be speculated over or thought about; thinking about which would lead to confusion and distress.

Speculation about the world or thoughts about the origin of the universe, bhikkhus, are inconceivable, not to be speculated over or thought about; thinking about which would lead to confusion and distress.

These, indeed, bhikkhus, are the four inconceivable things, not to be speculated over or thought about; thinking about which would lead to confusion and distress."
