"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of \{verbal misconduct} (misbehavior in speech [vacīduccarit]). What four?

1 Lying (false speech [musāvāda]),

2 \{divisive speech} (slanderous, defamatory, malicious [pisuṇa vācā]),

3 \{harsh speech} (abusive, rough, hard, unkind [pharusā vācā]),

4 \{frivolous chatter} (meaningless talk, gossip, idle speech [samphappalāpa]).

These are the four kinds of verbal misconduct."
