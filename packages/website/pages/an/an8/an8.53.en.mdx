Once, the Blessed One was dwelling in Vesālī in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One; having approached, she paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One:

"Please, venerable sir, teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute."

### Dhamma To Be Abandoned

"Gotamī, you should know the Dhamma to be abandoned if you find:

1 'These teachings lead to passion (lust, desire, infatuation [sarāga]), not to dispassion;

2 to \{being bound} (bondage, fetter, association, attachment, involvement [saṁyoga]), not to being unbound;

3 to accumulation (increase, growth [ācaya]), not to reduction;

4 to \{wanting more} (having many desires, greediness [mahicchatā]), not to wanting less;

5 to discontentment (dissatisfaction [asantuṭṭhi]), not to contentment;

6 to company (socializing, society, association [saṅgaṇikā]), not to seclusion;

7 to procrastination (laziness, inactivity, idleness [kosajja]), not to arousing energy;

8 to \{being difficult to support} (being burdensome [dubbharatā]), not to being easy to support.'

In this way, Gotamī, you should conclude: 'This is not the Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha that point to the nature of reality, the ultimate truth [dhamma]), this is not the Vinaya (training, discipline [vinaya]), this is not the Teacher's instruction.'

### Dhamma To Be Embraced

And, Gotamī, you should know the Dhamma to be embraced if you find:

1 'These teachings lead to dispassion, not to passion;

2 to \{being unbound} (release, liberation [visaṁyoga]), not to being bound;

3 to reduction (decrease, dispersal, discarding, less [apacaya]), not to accumulation;

4 to \{wanting less} (having few wishes [appicchatā]), not to wanting more;

5 to contentment (satisfaction [santuṭṭhi]), not to discontentment;

6 to seclusion (solitude [paviveka]), not to company;

7 to \{arousing energy} (taking initiative, making a mental decision to act [vīriyārambha]), not to procrastination;

8 to \{being easy to support} (being unburdensome, being low maintenance [subharatā]), not to being difficult to support.'

In this way, Gotamī, you should conclude: 'This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher's instruction.'"
