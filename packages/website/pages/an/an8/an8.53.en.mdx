title: Saṅkhittasutta - Brief
description: The Buddha advises Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī to abandon teachings that lead to passion, being bound, accumulating, wanting more, discontentment, company, laziness, and being burdensome. Instead, embrace teachings that lead to dispassion, being unbound, shedding, wanting less, contentment, solitude, the arousal of energy, and being unburdensome.

Once, the Blessed One was staying at Vesālī in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One; having approached, she paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One:

"Please, venerable sir, teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute."

"Gotamī, you should know the Dhamma to be abandoned if you find: 'These teachings lead to passion, not to dispassion; to being bound, not to being unbound; to accumulating, not to shedding; to wanting more, not to wanting less; to discontentment, not to contentment; to company, not to solitude; to laziness, not to the arousal of energy; to being burdensome, not to being unburdensome.' In this way, Gotamī, you should conclude: 'This is not the Dhamma, this is not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher's instruction.'

And, Gotamī, you should know the Dhamma to be embraced if you find: 'These teachings lead to dispassion, not to passion; to being unbound, not to being bound; to shedding, not to accumulating; to wanting less, not to wanting more; to contentment, not to discontentment; to solitude, not to company; to the arousal of energy, not to laziness; to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome.' In this way, Gotamī, you should conclude: 'This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher's instruction.'"
