At one time, the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha, at Vulture's Peak Mountain, shortly after Devadatta had left. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus concerning Devadatta:

"Bhikkhus, it is good for a bhikkhu to review from time to time his own failings. It is good for a bhikkhu to review from time to time the failings of others. It is good for a bhikkhu to review from time to time his own success. It is good for a bhikkhu to review from time to time the success of others. Overcome by eight unwholesome qualities, with a mind possessed, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for a long time, incurable.

Which eight? Bhikkhus, 1) overcome by acquisitions, with a mind possessed, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for a long time, incurable. 2) Overcome by loss, 3) by fame, 4) by disrepute, 5) by honor, 6) by dishonor, 7) by evil wishes, 8) by evil friendship, with a mind possessed, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for a long time, incurable. Bhikkhus, overcome by these eight unwholesome qualities, with a mind possessed, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for a long time, incurable.

Bhikkhus, it is good for a bhikkhu to overcome arisen acquisitions and dwell, to overcome arisen loss, arisen fame, arisen disrepute, arisen honor, arisen dishonor, arisen evil wishes, arisen evil friendship and dwell.

Bhikkhus, what reason does a bhikkhu have to overcome arisen acquisitions and dwell, to overcome arisen loss, arisen fame, arisen disrepute, arisen honor, arisen dishonor, arisen evil wishes, arisen evil friendship and dwell?

Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu does not overcome arisen acquisitions while dwelling, defilements that are troublesome and afflictive would arise. If he overcomes arisen acquisitions while dwelling, then those defilements that are troublesome and afflictive do not arise. Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu does not overcome arisen loss, fame, disrepute, honor, dishonor, evil wishes, or evil friendship while dwelling, defilements that are troublesome and afflictive would arise. If he overcomes arisen evil friendship while dwelling, then those defilements that are troublesome and afflictive do not arise. Bhikkhus, this is the reason a bhikkhu should overcome arisen acquisitions and dwell, to overcome arisen loss, arisen fame, arisen disrepute, arisen honor, arisen dishonor, arisen evil wishes, arisen evil friendship and dwell.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We will overcome arisen acquisitions and dwell, we will overcome arisen loss, arisen fame, arisen disrepute, arisen honor, arisen dishonor, arisen evil wishes, arisen evil friendship and dwell.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train."
