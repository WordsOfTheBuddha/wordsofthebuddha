Once, the Blessed One was staying at Vesālī in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, remember Ugga the householder of Vesālī as being endowed with eight wonderful and marvelous qualities."

The Blessed One said this. Having spoken thus, the Well-Gone One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.

Then, a certain bhikkhu, after dressing in the morning and taking his bowl and robe, approached the residence of Ugga the householder of Vesālī; having approached, he sat down on a prepared seat. Then, Ugga the householder of Vesālī approached that bhikkhu; having approached, he paid homage to the bhikkhu and sat down to one side. As Ugga the householder of Vesālī was seated to one side, the bhikkhu said to him:

"Householder, the Blessed One has declared that you are endowed with eight wonderful and marvelous qualities. What are they?"

"Venerable sir, I do not know what eight wonderful and marvelous qualities the Blessed One has declared that I possess. However, there are indeed eight wonderful and marvelous qualities found in me. Listen to it and pay close attention, I will speak."

"Yes, householder," the bhikkhu responded to Ugga the householder of Vesālī. Then Ugga the householder of Vesālī spoke thus:

1) "When I first saw the Blessed One from afar, with just that sight itself, venerable sir, my mind became inspired with confidence in the Blessed One. This, venerable sir, is the first wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

2) Venerable sir, with a confident mind, I attended upon the Blessed One. The Blessed One gradually gave me a discourse, first on giving, then on virtue, and then on the heavens. He explained the dangers, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that my mind was ready, receptive, free of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he then expounded to me the distinctive teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth with no dark spots would perfectly absorb dye, so too, as I was sitting there, the stainless, immaculate Dhamma eye arose in me: 'Whatever is subject to arising, is subject to cessation.' Venerable sir, I then became one who has seen the Dhamma, who has attained the Dhamma, who has understood the Dhamma, who has deeply penetrated the Dhamma, having crossed beyond doubt, with no more uncertainty, self-assured, and independent of others in the Teacher's instruction. Right there, I went for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and I undertook the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. This, venerable sir, is the second wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

3) Venerable sir, I had four young wives. I approached them and said: 'Sisters, I have undertaken the training rules with celibacy as the fifth. Whoever wishes may stay here and enjoy the wealth and perform meritorious deeds, or you may return to your own family. Or if there is another man you prefer, I will give you to him.' When I said this, my eldest wife replied: 'Give me to such and such a man, dear husband.' So, venerable sir, I called that man, and with my left hand I gave my wife to him, and with my right hand, I presented him with a ceremonial offering. Yet, venerable sir, even while parting with my young wife, I did not notice any alteration in my mind. This, venerable sir, is the third wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

4) Venerable sir, there is wealth in my family, and it is not withheld from those who are virtuous and of an upright nature. This, venerable sir, is the fourth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

5) Venerable sir, when I attend upon a bhikkhu, I do so with proper respect, not without respect. This, venerable sir, is the fifth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

6) Venerable sir, if that venerable one teaches me the Dhamma, I listen to it attentively, not carelessly. If he does not teach me the Dhamma, I teach him the Dhamma. This, venerable sir, is the sixth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

7) It is not unusual for deities to come to me and announce: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, householder.' When this is said, venerable sir, I reply to those deities: 'Whether you deities say this or not, the Dhamma is indeed well-expounded by the Blessed One. However, venerable sir, I do not perceive any elation of mind because of this, thinking: 'Deities approach me, and I converse with them.' This, venerable sir, is the seventh wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

8) Venerable sir, regarding the five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I do not see anything within myself that has not been abandoned. This, venerable sir, is the eighth wonderful and marvelous quality that is found in me.

These, venerable sir, are the eight wonderful and marvelous qualities that are found in me. However, I do not know which eight wonderful and marvelous qualities the Blessed One declared that I am endowed with."

Then the bhikkhu, after taking alms food from the house of Ugga the householder of Vesālī, rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, the bhikkhu, having completed his alms round, approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the bhikkhu reported to the Blessed One all of his conversation with Ugga the householder of Vesālī.

The Blessed One said, "Good, good, bhikkhu. As Ugga the householder of Vesālī rightly explained, in the same way, I declare that he is endowed with these eight wonderful and marvelous qualities. Bhikkhu, remember Ugga the householder of Vesālī as being endowed with these eight wonderful and marvelous qualities."
