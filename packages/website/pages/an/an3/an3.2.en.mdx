"Bhikkhus, an immature person is known by their actions, a wise person is known by their actions; conduct is what makes one shine. An immature person should be recognized by three qualities. What are these three? Bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct.

Indeed, bhikkhus, an immature person should be recognized by these three qualities.

A wise person should be recognized by three qualities. What are these three? Bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, and mental good conduct.

Indeed, bhikkhus, a wise person should be recognized by these three qualities.

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'Avoiding the three qualities by which an immature person is recognized, and adopting the three qualities by which a wise person is known, we will behave accordingly.' Thus, bhikkhus, you should train."
