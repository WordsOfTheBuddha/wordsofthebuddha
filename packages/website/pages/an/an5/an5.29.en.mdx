"Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of walking meditation. What are the five? One is able to endure long journeys, one is able to endure striving, one is seldom sick, what has been eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted is properly digested, and the collectedness attained by walking meditation is long-lasting. These, bhikkhus, are the five benefits of walking meditation."
