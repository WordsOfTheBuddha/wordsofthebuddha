"Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who develops and frequently practices these five qualities can expect one of two results: either final knowledge (enlightenment) in this very life or, if there is a trace of clinging left, the state of non-returning.

What are these five?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from aspiration (a goal, an interest, an objective, i.e. a wholesome motivation) and accompanied by intentional effort,

develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from energy and accompanied by intentional effort,

develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from [purification of] mind and active effort and accompanied by intentional effort,

develops the basis of psychic ability that is endowed with collectedness arising from investigation (reflection and close examination) and accompanied by intentional effort,

enthusiasm itself makes the fifth.
